5a989a37410cf7000162ec54,2018-03-02T00:26:23+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/ford-f150-aluminum-trucks.html,Business,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Three years ago, Ford Motor made a daring gamble when it started selling a new version of its F-150 pickup truck made mainly of aluminum rather than steel. No carmaker had ever committed to using aluminum so widely in such a high-volume, high-profile vehicle. But the new F-150 proved to be a technological marvel — 700 pounds lighter than the truck’s previous version, able to pull heavy loads with a V6 engine rather than a gas-guzzling V8. Ford expected aluminum to give its truck a critical advantage in an era of tougher fuel-economy standards and rising gasoline prices. The company also thought the truck would pull customers away from General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and command prices high enough to increase Ford’s profit, despite aluminum’s higher cost. But the revolutionary switch seems to be giving Ford less of an edge than it had hoped. With moderate gasoline prices, fuel economy is no longer a persuasive factor for many truck buyers. While sales are brisk, F-Series trucks — including the F-150 and the brawnier Super Duty — have only slightly increased their share of the full-size pickup truck segment since the aluminum models arrived. Their share is actually lower than it was in 2013. Moreover, the lightweight metal has become one of several factors weighing down Ford’s profitability. In 2017, the company’s income in North America fell 17 percent, in part because of rising steel and aluminum prices. Aluminum prices have risen more than 20 percent in the last three years — and seem likely to increase further after the Trump administration’s vowed to impose tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel. The announcement on Thursday sent Ford’s shares down 3 percent, and the stocks of the other Detroit automakers also fell sharply. Ford “thought gas prices were going to go to $6 or $8 gallon, and therefore having a couple miles per gallon more would be a big market-share mover that consumers would pay for,” said Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital. “It’s one of those managerial decisions that, if you had a crystal ball on the future, you might make differently.” Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of global operations, acknowledged that the increasing cost of aluminum had become a problem. “It is not the biggest issue, but it is an issue,” he said recently while giving reporters a tour of a Louisville plant that has started making two aluminum-bodied sport-utility vehicles. The plant also makes Super Duty trucks. Ford has no second thoughts about making the aluminum truck, Mr. Hinrichs added, noting that its light weight provides a smooth ride and increases towing and hauling capacity. “Aluminum also allowed us to have a lot more capability in a truck, and that’s what people buy for,” he said. The F-Series remains the nation’s top-selling vehicle line, accounting for a third of the cars and trucks Ford produces in North America and its biggest source of profits. Last year, Ford built more than one million F-Series trucks, and United States sales topped 896,000 — both the highest totals since 2005. The trucks commanded higher prices, too: They sold for an average of $49,552 in 2017, up more than $6,000 since 2014, according to Edmunds.com. The company does not disclose the profitability of individual models, but analysts widely believe the margin on a full-size truck can be $10,000 or more. The margin on cars is often only a few hundred dollars, or less. Ford’s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, said the profit on F-Series trucks remained robust and rose in 2017. The trucks were “not a contributor to the decline in profitability at all,” he said. Rather, income was squeezed by development of electric vehicles and other new models, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and other rising costs, he said. But a deeper look at the truck reveals some concerns. While the F-Series remains the clear leader in full-size pickups, it isn’t leaving competitors in the dust. Last year, the F-Series accounted for 37.4 percent of all full-size truck sales, according to Edmunds.com. That was a percentage point more than in 2014, but two points less than in 2013. If aluminum prices keep rising and F-Series profitability suffers, the challenges could increase pressure on Ford’s chief executive, Jim Hackett. Mr. Hackett, who took over in May, has vowed to cut costs to improve the automaker’s “fitness.” Even with higher F-Series production and prices, Ford suffered a clunker of a year in 2017. In North America, pretax profit slumped to $7.5 billion, from $9 billion in 2016. Its profit margin in the region fell to 8 percent from 9.7 percent the year before. The results look worse when compared with G.M.’s North American operations, which earned $11.9 billion and had a margin of 10.7 percent. “The contrast with G.M. is pretty stark,” said Rod Lache, a financial analyst at Deutsche Bank. Even if metal prices remain steady, Ford is in for a tough fight in trucks. New-vehicle sales in the United States are expected to decline this year and next. There are new offerings from competitors, as well: G.M.’s Chevrolet and GMC brands and Fiat Chrysler’s Ram line are introducing redesigned pickups this year, with new features. On Thursday, G.M. unveiled a GMC Sierra available with a bed of carbon-fiber composite, another lightweight material. “Ford will have the oldest truck on the market, so it’s not going to get easier from here,” Mr. Lache said. The aluminum F-150 was in the planning stages when gasoline spiked to $4 a gallon and the Obama administration moved toward tougher fuel-economy standards. But by the time the first aluminum F-150s were produced in late 2014, gas prices were closer to $2 and fuel economy was less of a concern for consumers. G.M. and Fiat Chrysler improved the fuel economy of their pickups, partly by using more aluminum parts, but not to the extent that Ford did. Ford adjusted its marketing to highlight attributes other than fuel economy, and struck a chord with many customers. “The F-Series is doing awesome,” said Charlie Gilchrist, who has owned two Ford dealerships near Dallas for years and purchased a third this month. “I think aluminum is an advantage for us. You can haul more. It’s durable.” But Jeff Schuster, an analyst at LMC Automotive, a market research firm, suspects that the switch to aluminum has proved more expensive in ways beyond the cost of the metal. Aluminum sheets are tricky to stamp — they spring back more than steel. They are not magnetic, so standard machines that use magnets to lift metal parts had be to scrapped in favor of new systems that use suction. Ford had to develop technologies to fasten aluminum to steel — the metals cannot be welded together the way sheets of steel can. “I think the cost of engineering and development was more than it would have been otherwise if they hadn’t used aluminum,” Mr. Schuster said. “All the testing, the tooling — it’s probably those costs, not just the actual commodity costs.” The move to aluminum “hasn’t been a disaster,” he said. “But maybe not a home run, either.”",7117
5a988f95410cf7000162ec31,2018-03-01T23:41:00+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/media/weinstein-company-sale.html,Business,"LOS ANGELES — In a surprise twist in the continuing saga of the Weinstein Company, an investor group said on Thursday that it had reached an agreement to buy most of the assets of the near-bankrupt studio, just days after a deal had been declared all but dead. “This next step represents the best possible pathway to support victims and protect employees,” Maria Contreras-Sweet, who leads the investor group, said in a statement. In keeping with the whipsawing sale process, however, it did not become clear that a deal had in fact been completed until the Weinstein Company’s board released a statement several hours later. “We consider this to be a positive outcome under what have been incredibly difficult circumstances,” the statement said. The board also thanked Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, who hosted a meeting between the two sides at his offices on Thursday. Ms. Contreras-Sweet, who declined an interview request, is best known for running the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama. According to a person briefed on the deal, an agreement will call for her group to pay off the Weinstein Company’s debt, which totals roughly $225 million. In return, the group will receive the majority of the studio’s assets, which include “Project Runway” and a 277-film library. Those assets will be used to start a new entertainment firm, which the Weinstein Company’s 150 employees, or at least most of them, will be invited to join. The new company will be “led by a board of directors made up of a majority of independent women,” Ms. Contreras-Sweet said in her statement. The group will invest an additional $275 million in the new studio to fund operations. The Weinstein Company has been struggling to remain afloat since October, when The New York Times and The New Yorker magazine disclosed decades of sexual harassment allegations against the company’s co-owner Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has denied ever engaging in “non-consensual sex.” The deal includes a victims’ fund worth up to $90 million, and Mr. Weinstein and his brother, Bob, who jointly own about 42 percent of the Weinstein Company, will receive no cash from the sale. Other equity holders will also be wiped out. In a statement, Mr. Schneiderman said, “As part of these negotiations, we are pleased to have received express commitments from the parties that the new company will create a real, well-funded victims’ compensation fund, implement H.R. policies that will protect all employees and will not unjustly reward bad actors.” He added, “We will work with the parties in the weeks ahead to ensure that the parties honor and memorialize these commitments.” The Weinstein Company had said on Sunday that it would file for bankruptcy after the collapse of talks with Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group, which includes the billionaire investor Ron Burkle. The Weinstein Company’s board said at the time that promised interim funding from the group had not materialized, leaving bankruptcy as the only option. But on Thursday, Mr. Schneiderman got the sale back on track by holding a meeting in his offices with Mr. Burkle and Ms. Contreras-Sweet and members of the Weinstein Company’s board, including Bob Weinstein and Lance Maerov, an executive at the advertising giant WPP Group. Mr. Burkle, who has a long history with the Weinstein Company, stepping in to help Harvey Weinstein finance films like “Our Idiot Brother” in 2011, asked for the meeting. Mr. Schneiderman sued the company and the Weinstein brothers on Feb. 11, alleging that they violated state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment and coercion. A deal for the company had been expected to be formalized on Feb. 12, but the lawsuit brought sale talks to a halt. Amy Spitalnick, the press secretary for Mr. Schneiderman, said on Feb. 11 that his office had recently reached out to representatives of Ms. Contreras-Sweet to emphasize the importance of adequately compensating victims, protecting employees and not rewarding those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein’s misconduct. “We were surprised to learn they were not serious about discussing any of those issues or even sharing the most basic information about how they planned to address them,” Ms. Spitalnick said. Mr. Schneiderman said again in a Feb. 12 news conference “there was no victim compensation fund.” Ms. Contreras-Sweet was stunned by Mr. Schneiderman’s public remarks, according to one person briefed on the matter, believing that he was overlooking money for victims that had been built into her proposal. By the end of that week, Mr. Schneiderman had started to get what he wanted. The Weinstein Company, for instance, fired its president, David Glasser, on Feb. 16. Mr. Glasser had been expected to run the new studio; Mr. Schneiderman had pointed to him as being one of the managers who perpetuated Mr. Weinstein’s behavior. Ms. Contreras-Sweet also met with Mr. Schneiderman and laid out her plans for a victims’ compensation fund. In the end, the settlement fund was increased; up to $90 million will be made available, including an estimated $30 million in insurance money. Mr. Schneiderman’s lawsuit remains active, however. Ms. Contreras-Sweet outlined her plans for the company in a letter to its board in November, when she first made her offer. “I will be chairwoman of a majority-female board of directors,” she wrote in the letter. “Women will be significant investors in the new company and control its voting stock.” After failing to find other buyers who would keep the studio intact — Lionsgate, Shamrock Capital Advisors, Killer Content and the Qatari company beIN Media Group were among those considering various pieces — the board entered into exclusive negotiations with Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group in late January. Ms. Contreras-Sweet has no experience in Hollywood, but she is known in Los Angeles business and political circles. Much of her business career was spent at a California 7Up bottler, where she became vice president of public affairs and a part owner, according to her website. She then ran the California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, managing a $14 million budget. After that, she co-founded a private equity firm and in late 2006 founded ProAmerica Bank, which focused on Latino small business owners. The bank struggled and was sold in 2015. “We are grateful to the New York State attorney general’s office for their efforts in helping us reach an agreement, and we are grateful to our investors who have believed in this process and in the compelling value of a female-led company,” her statement on Thursday said. “We also want to thank all the parties who returned to the negotiating table to help us reach this development.”",6765

Rich Ross, the head of the flagship Discovery Channel since 2014, is out, the company announced Thursday, and will be replaced by Nancy Daniels, the president of the TLC Network. Also, Kathleen Finch, currently a top executive at Scripps Networks, will oversee numerous cable channels in the expanded Discovery empire, including HGTV, Food Network and ID, and will get the title of chief lifestyle brands officer. In Mr. Ross’s three and a half years at the cable network, he looked to class up some of its reality fare. He also introduced new scripted series, including “Manhunt: Unabomber,” and a number of documentaries. What Mr. Ross was lacking, though, were hits. Last year, Discovery’s ratings declined 12 percent in the 18-to-49 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The ratings of Discovery’s rival, the History channel, declined a modest 4 percent. The rating of TLC surged last year, propelled by shows like “My 600-lb Life,” “90 Day Fiancé” and “Long Lost Family.” Ms. Daniels had been president of TLC since 2013, and previously worked at the Discovery Channel. David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, praised Ms. Daniels as “a winner, with a proven track record across Discovery Channel and TLC and a deep understanding of how to draw viewers and generate buzz.”",1442

But they have plenty of money — $650 billion of it — and that’s growing. According to the Hurun Report, a research organization in Shanghai that tracks the wealthy in China, the net worth of the 153 members of China’s Parliament and its advisory body that it deems “super rich” amounts to $650 billion, up by nearly a third from a year ago. That is just a touch below Switzerland’s annual economic output. While President Xi Jinping has pledged to close the income gap and alleviate poverty, the wealth of the nation’s lawmakers has kept soaring. In 2017, it topped $500 billion, more than doubling from the year before. The surge in wealth reflects the strength of the Chinese economy, which grew 6.9 percent in 2017, and stock markets all over the world. Delegates to Parliament, or the National People’s Congress, rubber-stamp most of the policies set out by the party’s leadership and are expected to approve Mr. Xi’s plan to scrap term limits and allow him to rule indefinitely when they meet in Beijing next week. But the gathering provides businesspeople with an opportunity to hobnob with one another. The title of delegate also gives them extra cachet in making business deals. The number of billionaires in China’s legislature could contribute to the perception that the government is out of touch in a country where disposable income per capita was just over $4,000 in 2017. But many Chinese are proud of how quickly the ranks are growing. China added 210 billionaires over the past year — about four a week — 40 percent more than the United States, according to a separate list of the global rich by Hurun. The wealthiest lawmaker is also China’s richest person, Pony Ma, whose net worth is $47 billion. He is the founder of Tencent, which owns WeChat, a social media mobile app that is indispensable in Chinese life. Tencent is now valued at $540 billion, more than Facebook. Mr. Ma was trailed by Xu Jiayin, the chairman of the property developer Evergrande Group, whose net worth is $41 billion. Mr. Xu was China’s richest person in 2017, according to Hurun. Other Chinese property developers also dominated the list. Lee Ka-kit, vice chairman of Henderson Land Development, is worth $34 billion, while the net worth of Country Garden Group’s founder, Yang Guoqiang, reached $32 billion. The fortunes of China’s entrepreneurs have changed significantly since the Communist Party, which was founded to work for the interests of workers and stamp out capitalism, welcomed businesspeople into the party more than a decade ago. About 20 percent of the nearly 3,000 delegates to Parliament are businesspeople, according to government news media. Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, and an expert on money and politics in China, said that being a member of the National People’s Congress “affords a considerable protection for the wealthy.” “If you’re part of the NPC, you become a state cadre, and so the local police can’t arrest you easily without cause,” he said, referring to the congress. “That’s not the case for a wealthy person who has no affiliation with the Chinese government, and wealth becomes very vulnerable to predatory action by a local government.”",3350
5a987816410cf7000162ebe4,2018-03-01T22:00:48+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/media/facebook-ads-gender.html,Business,"Advertisement Supported by Advertisers, especially smaller ones, complain of inconsistency and gender bias in the process that determines whether images are rejected for being sexually suggestive.  By Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel When Krista Venero, an author who writes under the pen name K.L. Montgomery, bought ads on Facebook for a romance novel she published last year, she thought her marketing fell well within the bounds of the social network’s policies.  The ad showed an image of a woman photographed from behind with a portion of her upper back exposed. It didn’t seem particularly racy, certainly no more than an ad for Olay body wash, showing a woman’s bare back and legs, that Ms. Venero had recently seen. Facebook rejected her ad, however, and when she disputed the decision, a representative told her that it implied nudity and that the company did not allow ads “with a sexual undertone.”  Facebook now says it incorrectly rejected Ms. Venero’s ad, but the back and forth is an example of the social network’s struggles over images of the human body. More precisely, as Facebook processes millions of ads a week through a mix of automation and human review, what is acceptable and what isn’t, and who is making those decisions?  Ms. Venero now tends to make her ads “extremely conservative, she said. “They usually just have a man and woman’s face on them,” she added. “I do have one that has a man’s chest, and I’ve never had any problems with it. But a woman’s shoulder — we have a problem.”  Ms. Venero is not the only one to complain that Facebook is inconsistent when deciding which images are sexually suggestive, particularly pictures of women. The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man’s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to “steamy romance novels” called Beyond 50 Shades. That image, in which the man had his thumb on the inside of his pants, was incorrectly approved, a Facebook spokeswoman recently said.  April Ray, who helps run a book blog, Reading After Dark, was alarmed late last year when a photo of her was flagged as adult content. Ms. Ray was using the picture, which showed her reading in a dark room in a black T-shirt, as part of a promotion for the blog’s Facebook page.  “It definitely stung a little because it was my profile picture and I’ve had it for three years now, and it’s just my face — I’m wearing a regular T-shirt that I think I got at the Gap,” Ms. Ray said. She said it had taken several days for her appeal to reach a person at Facebook. The photo was then approved, but it was too late for a contest her blog was running.  Facebook’s ad practices have long been scrutinized, even more so after 13 Russians were indicted in February on charges that they tried to disrupt the 2016 presidential election by, among other things, distributing divisive ads through the social network. But the disputes raised by Ms. Venero and Ms. Ray are indicative of questions raised by smaller advertisers, who rely on Facebook to market their work but often have to navigate the appeals process themselves.  Facebook prohibits adult content in ads, including “depictions of people in explicit or suggestive positions” and “activities that are overly suggestive or sexually provocative.” The rules also extend to “implied nudity,” “excessive visible skin” and images that are too focused on individual body parts “even if not explicitly sexual in nature.” On Facebook’s website, all of the examples showed women.  “Facebook’s policies have the effect of sexualizing women’s bodies in a way that is not necessary and very unhealthy for society,” said Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates digital privacy protections. She added that while the company allowed topless men, it took a strict approach to nudity of a female torso.  Joel Jones, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions operations, said that the company tended to be “conservative” when monitoring ads that people might find offensive but that its enforcement of adult content did not distinguish between men and women. Human reviewers are trained with examples that feature both men and women, Mr. Jones said, and he noted that more women appeared in ads — almost twice as often as men in a sampling during the previous 30 days. For advertisers, debating what constitutes “adult content” with those human reviewers can be frustrating. Goodbye Bread, an edgy online retailer for young women, said it had a heated debate with Facebook in December over the image of young woman modeling a leopard-print mesh shirt. Facebook said the picture was too suggestive.  When Goodbye Bread challenged the decision, and a company representative replied that the issue was the policy against ads “that show a lot of skin.”  “The shirt is considerably transparent in the fact that the breast would be visible had it not been blurred,” the representative said, adding that as a result, the nudity was “implied.” When presented with the email exchange by The New York Times, a Facebook spokeswoman said that the image did not violate its policies on adult content and that the company had sent “incorrect messaging” to Goodbye Bread. The post, the spokesperson said, actually violated a separate policy involving profanity because of another image in the same ad.  George Stamelos, a co-founder of Goodbye Bread, said fashion brands regularly dealt with mixed messages from Facebook on skin and suggestiveness in ads but could often successfully appeal to human moderators. He also said Facebook’s policies were unfairly applied to women.  “I get bombarded with stupid ads for swimwear and stuff like that — every guy is topless with a six pack, and they don’t have a problem with that,” Mr. Stamelos said. “During the summer, we couldn’t advertise our swimwear collection on Facebook because we kept getting rejected for excessive skin.”  It’s sticky territory for a company of Facebook’s size, particularly when there is intense scrutiny on gender inequality. It also raises questions about who, at a company where just 35 percent of the employees are women, is deciding what’s suggestive.  Facebook declined to give rough estimates of how many people work on reviewing and approving ads or say where they are. In October, the company announced it was hiring 1,000 additional people to review ads in the wake of congressional hearings that examined the role Facebook played in helping spread disinformation during the 2016 election, including the impact of Russian political ads purchased on Facebook.  Mr. Jones of Facebook said the company set higher standards for ads than for regular posts from users because ads were “proactively pushed out to people.” He said Facebook was “focused on improving our review protocols and automated systems.” Facebook, which counts more than two billion users worldwide, has frequently been accused of taking a conservative, and at times haphazard, approach to what types of nudity it finds acceptable.  In 2008, women began noticing that their photos of breast-feeding were being removed from personal posts as well as from private groups where women shared advice and tips on how to nurse their babies. Critics of Facebook have since argued that its policies against showing female nipples harm health initiatives that encourage breast-feeding.  In 2016, the company was criticized for censoring a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a young girl running naked after a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. Facebook rescinded its decision, saying, “In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image.” Mr. Stamelos said he hoped Facebook would reconsider how it applied its policies to women and men, adding that he had seen the company take a harder line on its appeals recently. “This is extremely problematic, especially considering the magnitude of Facebook’s reach,” he said. Ms. Venero, the author, never got a response from Facebook about why her ad was rejected and the body wash ad was approved, she said. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company could not ask an automated system about those decisions.  “I understand they have to prohibit content that really is disturbing,” Ms. Venero said. “But whatever their algorithms are that do this, or the humans in their department that look at these ads — they just aren’t consistent with it.” Sapna Maheshwari covers advertising.

5a9876af410cf7000162ebd9,2018-03-01T21:54:49+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/delta-nra-georgia.html,Business,"ATLANTA — Georgia lawmakers approved a bill on Thursday that stripped out a tax break proposal highly coveted by Delta Air Lines — the most stinging punishment that America’s pro-gun forces have leveled so far on one of the many corporations recalibrating their positions on firearms after the Florida high school massacre. The $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel that was sought by Delta, one of Georgia’s biggest employers, had been included in a broader tax-relief bill. But this week, a number of Georgia Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, sought to remove the perk as retribution for Delta’s decision to end a promotional discount for members of the National Rifle Association. Delta, in announcing the policy change, said it was trying to remain “neutral” in a national gun debate that has been rekindled by a gunman’s attack at a school in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead. A number of other major American companies, including the car rental company Hertz and MetLife insurance, have also ended relationships with the N.R.A. since the shooting on Feb. 14. On Thursday, the Georgia Senate overwhelmingly approved a version of the bill without the jet-fuel tax break. The House, which had already approved a version of the bill, also approved the change. Both houses are controlled by Republicans. The legislation now goes to the desk of the Republican governor, Nathan Deal, who has pledged to sign it into law. But Mr. Deal is a supporter of the jet-fuel tax break, and he said he would sign the bill only because it also included a significant reduction in personal and corporate tax rates. In a sign of the gulf that has opened between gun-rights purists and Republicans with a more pro-business bent, Mr. Deal this week appeared to chastise fellow Republicans who sought to punish Delta, and thus potentially harm Georgia’s business-friendly reputation. “Ours is a welcoming state — the epitome of ‘Southern Hospitality,’” said Mr. Deal, who will leave office because of term limits early next year. “We were not elected to give the late-night talk show hosts fodder for their monologues or to act with the type of immaturity that has caused so many in our society to have a cynical view of politics.” In addition to being one of Georgia’s biggest employers, Delta is the economic engine of Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the busiest airport in the world and a bragging point in the city’s claim to national and even international stature. The divisions over gun control are stark in Georgia, where Mr. Cagle is among a handful of Republicans who are seeking to be the next governor. They are particularly eager to make an impression among the hard-right conservatives who will have a big voice in the Republican primary in May. Mr. Cagle, the presumptive front-runner in the governor’s race, presides over the State Senate, and his threat on Monday to kill the tax break was interpreted here as a way to protect his right flank from his Republican rivals. “I think that obviously Delta is free to make any decision that they want to,” Mr. Cagle said during an appearance on “Fox and Friends” this week. He added that Delta “chose to single out the N.R.A. and their membership, law-abiding gun owners, and I don’t think that’s right.” Delta announced on Saturday that it was ending a discount for N.R.A. members traveling to the association’s annual convention. Other Republican candidates for governor were also eager to weigh in in favor of rescinding the tax break. Secretary of State Brian Kemp said lawmakers should reject the perk to airlines and instead focus on creating a sales tax holiday for buyers of guns, ammunition, holsters and safes where guns can be stored. On the floor of the Senate on Thursday, Senator Michael Williams, another Republican candidate for governor, praised his fellow lawmakers for stripping the tax exemption, saying they “stood strong” in the face of pressure from liberals, the media and big business. Mr. Deal has said he was “committed to finding a pathway forward for the elimination of sales tax on jet fuel, which is nonnegotiable.” But the political reality seems to leave him with few options. Democrats have argued that the attack on Delta, which did not comment Thursday, could harm the ability to attract new businesses, chief among them Amazon. The online retailer named metropolitan Atlanta as one possible location for its new headquarters. “Unfortunately, we’re looking at political gamesmanship, and trying to send ultraconservative messages for the Republican primary,” said Senator Steve Henson, the minority leader. “I think it does not enhance our chances to get Amazon.”",4673

Stocks, which had already been down for the day, slipped further after the White House announced the planned tariffs. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent to 2,682 Thursday afternoon, after falling roughly 2 percent earlier in the day. Shares of automakers such as Ford and General Motors, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply, as the tariffs would raise the cost of raw materials. “Historically, the automakers have to absorb these costs,” said Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS who covers automakers. “Consumers don’t adjust their price expectations based on higher steel prices.” Shares of industrial companies also dropped, led by exporters such as Boeing and United Technologies. On the other hand, some companies that sell industrial metals saw their stock prices rise, with shares of AK Steel up roughly 8 percent and U.S. Steel jumping more than 6 percent. The prospect of a protectionist policy push forced investors Thursday to rethink whether that could derail a global economy that has been growing across the board over the last year. In fact, until Mr. Trump’s comments on Thursday, the prevailing worry for investors seemed to be that economic growth — both in the United States and around the world — was so robust that the Federal Reserve might move quickly to raise interest rates in order to fend off inflation. Those concerns led to a sharp sell-off in the stock market in early February, with the S.&P. at one point down more than 10 percent from its January peak. Mr. Trump’s comments seemed to overshadow those concerns, at least for the moment. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note — which moves in the opposite direction of its price — dropped sharply Thursday as investors scurried to the safety of American government bonds. After flirting with 3 percent in recent weeks, the yield was hovering near 2.80 percent Thursday afternoon.",2000
5a984b45410cf7000162eb58,2018-03-01T18:49:34+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/media/hope-hicks-departure-trump.html,Business,"When Hope Hicks walked into President Trump’s private study on Wednesday to inform him that she planned to leave the White House — concluding a can’t-make-it-up run in which Ms. Hicks, a woman with zero political experience three years ago, became the closest aide to the most powerful man in the world — the president responded like a father whose daughter had outgrown the nest. According to a person with knowledge of their conversation, Mr. Trump expressed an understanding of Ms. Hicks’s desire to pursue a new phase of her life. But, the person added, he also acknowledged something else: that Ms. Hicks’s happiness in her role had begun to wane lately, after a trying few weeks in the public glare. The departure of Ms. Hicks, arguably the least experienced person to ever hold the job of White House communications director, capped an astounding rise for a political neophyte whose seemingly implausible career hinged on a deep understanding of, and bottomless patience for, her mercurial charge. But as someone with a pull toward discretion — Ms. Hicks, 29, who grew up in the buttoned-up suburb of Greenwich, Conn., the daughter and granddaughter of prominent public relations men — seeing her name splashed across international tabloids had taken a toll. In explaining her decision to friends, Ms. Hicks, a communications director who rarely spoke publicly, made clear that she had no interest in being at the center of the public conversation. That aversion to the spotlight had become increasingly difficult to maintain. Ms. Hicks’s role in helping write a statement by Donald J. Trump Jr. about a 2016 meeting with Russian officials has drawn attention from federal investigators. On Tuesday, she testified for eight hours before the House Intelligence Committee and made headlines for admitting that she had sometimes told fibs as part of her job. Last month, the man she had been dating, the former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, was accused by his former wives of domestic abuse, sparking an ongoing scandal that offered a glimpse of her closely guarded personal life and drew paparazzi to her apartment building. There were rumblings that Mr. Trump questioned Ms. Hicks’s judgment after the White House initially defended Mr. Porter, although a bevy of administration officials, including the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, later vouched for Ms. Hicks in on-the-record interviews. Ms. Hicks had stopped monitoring news coverage of herself, restricting her television intake to Fox News, which she often watched on mute, assuming that the Trump-friendly network would rarely include her name on its chyrons. Friends who reached out to her, offering support or guidance, acknowledged that Ms. Hicks had been distressed. But they also received text messages from her in which she declared that she was tougher than people assumed. Ms. Hicks’s career followed a curious trajectory. As a young model, she appeared on the covers of young adult paperbacks and in Ralph Lauren catalogs before going to work for Ms. Trump’s apparel and licensing brand. Even after she had begun serving as an Oval Office gatekeeper, she maintained a low public profile, which fueled the fascination — and sometimes disdain — of those who watch national politics closely. Emily Nussbaum, The New Yorker’s television critic, often tweeted whimsically about Ms. Hicks, calling her an “It Girl.” (Ms. Hicks was once the face of a “Gossip Girl”-spinoff book series called “It Girl.”) Others dismissed her as a mere factotum, especially after a report that she was once tasked during the campaign with steaming Mr. Trump’s suits, sometimes while he was wearing them. On Wednesday, after news of Ms. Hicks’s exit was announced, the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino tweeted: “Goodbye to Hope Hicks, an object lesson in the quickest way a woman can advance under misogyny: silence, beauty, and unconditional deference to men.” In Washington, however, Ms. Hicks’s success was viewed as a product of other qualities, including her nuanced understanding of Mr. Trump’s moods, her ability to subtly nudge him away from his coarser impulses and her skill as a liaison for some of the most prominent journalists in the country. “When she tells you something, you know she is speaking to the president, because she is with him all the time,” said Steve Scully, the senior executive producer at C-Span and coordinator of the network’s White House coverage. “It was amazing how often he would turn to Hope and ask her questions and ask her point of view. You can really tell, seeing the two of them interact, that there’s a trust between the two of them.” Ms. Hicks was a key point of contact for reporters, editors and executives at television networks and major newspapers. Often, she could single-handedly arrange time with the easily distracted president. At a Paley Center panel discussion on Wednesday, the NBC News anchor Lester Holt described Ms. Hicks as his first contact for coordinating his interview with Mr. Trump last May. “She was quite helpful,” Mr. Holt said. And in an administration riven by infighting, Ms. Hicks’s privileged position with the president meant that, for journalists, she was among the few officials whose information was deemed reliable, or at least not often compromised by personal squabbles. Of course, she always advocated for her boss, lamenting that reporters did not see the empathetic and charming Mr. Trump whom she said she knew. Ms. Hicks, a reluctant émigré to insular Washington, kept a tiny circle of confidants, complaining that she could not trust anyone in a company town. She frequently visited family in Connecticut and friends in New York, where she felt she could comfortably walk down the street without being accosted or asked for a favor. She has told friends that, for now, she has no definite ideas for her life after the West Wing, except that she will not be living in Washington. An extended vacation with her family is planned. Book agents have come calling, but Ms. Hicks has told acquaintances that she is reluctant to write anything — although she has joked that a massive advance could change her mind. “I think she would benefit from taking a minute or two to get some perspective on all of this,” said Michael Feldman, a Clinton White House veteran who is a family friend of Ms. Hicks. “I don’t worry about Hope,” Mr. Feldman added, echoing other friends interviewed for this article. “I fully expect her to land on her feet.” Those confident in Ms. Hicks’s future prospects sounded more concerned about Mr. Trump and his ability to work without an aide he has relied on nearly every day for three years. “This is not losing a staffer,” Mr. Feldman said. “This is like losing a limb.”",6743
5a9846de410cf7000162eb4b,2018-03-01T18:30:48+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/technology/facebook-end-news-feed-experiment-six-countries-that-magnified-fake-news.html,Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Sheera Frenkel SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook said on Thursday that it would end an experiment in six countries that separated posts from news sites and publishers from other material on the social network. News organizations in the countries — Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Bolivia, Guatemala and Serbia — had said they were blindsided by the Facebook experiment when it began in October and complained that it had led to a surprising rise in misinformation. Facebook stopped short of acknowledging that the changes made in the experiment, called Explore, contributed to that increase in misinformation, but the company said it could have done a better job communicating with publishers about what was happening. “In surveys, people told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing, and having two separate feeds didn’t actually help them connect more with friends and family,” Adam Mosseri, who heads Facebook’s News Feed, said in a statement posted online. “We also received feedback that we made it harder for people in the test countries to access important information, and that we didn’t communicate the test clearly.” Facebook and other social media companies are grappling with their role in spreading false information propagated by Russians ahead of the 2016 presidential election. And they face increasing pressure from regulators around the world to get a better handle on what happens on their networks, from misinformation to cyberbullying. Also on Thursday, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, said his company was looking for ways to measure the “health” of conversations on Twitter. In a series of tweets, Mr. Dorsey acknowledged that Twitter has been home to a number of people who use the platform to harass, bully and mislead. “We have witnessed abuse, harassment, troll armies, manipulation through bots and human-coordination, misinformation campaigns, and increasingly divisive echo chambers,” Mr. Dorsey wrote. “We aren’t proud of how people have taken advantage of our service, or our inability to address it fast enough.” After Facebook released Explore in the six countries, it was quickly criticized by independent news sites and nongovernmental organizations. The changes, they said, made it harder for trusted sources of information to reach local populations. They also said the experiment had led to an increase in false and salacious news being shared in those countries. Stuart White, editor of The Phnom Penh Post, an English-language newspaper in Cambodia, said traffic from Facebook to his site had plummeted because of the changes to Facebook’s main News Feed — the scrolling stream of content that greets people when they log into the social network. The experiment took place during a crackdown by the country’s leader, Hun Sen, on political opponents, activists and media, effectively transforming the struggling democracy into a one-party state. Journalists were arrested, and newspapers were shut down. Facebook had emerged as an important, more independent channel for information. “Whether or not Facebook likes it, it has established itself as the main market for news in places like Cambodia,” Mr. White said. “It would be helpful if they acknowledged that responsibility.” Fabiola Chambi, the web editor of Los Tiempos, the main newspaper of the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, said Explore had reduced traffic to the site by 30 to 60 percent. Ms. Chambi said the Explore function was a constant source of confusion for publishers and readers who thought their access to news had been the subject of an experiment by a foreign company. “It wasn’t an idea that was ever well received, and garnered plenty of rejection,” she said. “And I would guess this had something to do with their decision to reverse course.” However, the move did force the newspaper for the first time to think about life after Facebook. “We had to confront the declines and in the end found some creative ways to improve traffic and maintain a loyal audience,” Ms. Chambi said. Facebook’s role as a kingmaker among publishers has played a central role in a debate over the responsibilities that social media companies have to police content on their own platforms. Facebook has announced a series of changes to its News Feed as it looks to increase “meaningful interaction” on its site by drawing attention to content from family and friends while de-emphasizing content from brands and publishers. Those changes will be introduced gradually around the world. Facebook has said those News Feed changes were not related to Explore, but there are similarities in the way the company is looking to play down material from publishers. While Facebook has said it was emphasizing meaningful interactions, Mr. Dorsey said Twitter was determined to find “holistic and fair solutions” to its problems. The company recently rewrote its user rules and guidelines, and has begun punishing well-known Twitter users who violate those rules by removing their “account verification” status or barring them altogether. It was unclear how either Twitter or Facebook will measure the new method by which they said they will judge their platforms, or how they will affect the billions of people who use them.

5a983cbc410cf7000162eb23,2018-03-01T17:47:30+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/trump-management-style-year-2-see-year-1.html,Business,"Throughout his presidential campaign Donald J. Trump extolled his business acumen and management skills, and just before his inauguration he insisted the transition to his administration was going “very, very smoothly.” Yet so chaotic was his first year in office that in January, after publication of the Michael Wolff tell-all, “Fire and Fury,” the president had to publicly defend himself as a “stable genius.” The White House suffered a staff turnover rate of 34 percent during Mr. Trump’s first year, a rate that would be unfathomable at nearly any for-profit enterprise. Even by political standards, it’s off the charts — triple that of the Obama administration, and twice that of Ronald Reagan, the previous record-holder — according to a study by the Brookings Institution. And that was before the recent messy departure of Rob Porter as staff secretary in the wake of spousal abuse allegations, or the announcement on Wednesday by the White House communications director Hope Hicks — the fourth person to hold the job — that she, too, was leaving. Now at least one White House faction wants Gary Cohn, the chief economic adviser and National Economic Council director — and a relative island of calm and stability — to replace John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, who was widely criticized for bungling the Porter affair. If so, he would become the president’s third chief of staff in just 14 months. But in this chaotic environment, for every rumor that Mr. Cohn is about to be promoted, there is one that he is about to resign. With over a full year under Mr. Trump’s belt, and his unorthodox management style fully in evidence, I asked several experts to assess the president’s abilities as a manager. “It’s much worse than I expected,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and the author of “Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don’t.” “The most important thing you need as a chief executive is the ability to hire and retain talent,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Trump said he’d get all these great people to work for him. But the rate of departures is unprecedented. Either he hired badly, or he hired well but couldn’t retain them. Either way, this reflects badly on his leadership.” As Jeffrey T. Polzer, professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School, told me last year, the time-tested approach is “to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise, who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand.” “Then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a high-quality solution,” Mr. Polzer said. He added that it “requires an openness to being challenged, and some self-awareness and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do.” Mr. Trump does appear to solicit and consider the opinions of others, but they are as likely to be random guests at Mar-a-Lago, or television pundits, as they are experts in the field, or even his own appointees. “The lack of attention to data drives me nuts,” Mr. Pfeffer said. Mr. Trump, he said, “seems to have no interest in science, social science or data,” citing White House initiatives to repeal Obamacare and to rescue the coal industry as glaring examples. Others pointed to his threats to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with little understanding of the consequences for American businesses and farmers, and his decision to abandon the Paris climate accord despite scant familiarity with the science of climate change. “Nothing about the chaos and turnover in the White House surprises me,” said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “He hasn’t changed in 30 years,” Mr. Elson added. “He isn’t bound by any traditional norms of management.” Yet despite the well-documented disarray prevailing in the West Wing, Mr. Trump’s first year has yielded some major accomplishments: business-friendly tax legislation, the appointment of a reliably conservative Supreme Court justice in Neil Gorsuch, the selection of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the dismantling of a regulatory regime viewed as overly burdensome by the business community. “You have to hand it to him: He has pulled some rabbits out of his hat,” Mr. Elson said. “Hardly anyone thought he could pull off tax legislation after so many other people had tried and failed.” But Mr. Pfeffer said those achievements had occurred despite the chaos, not because of it. For every success, Mr. Trump has had notable failures, starting with overhauling immigration policy and repealing Obamacare. “I’ve long felt that if Trump didn’t do well, it would be because of organizational issues,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Even with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, he hasn’t been able to pass much. That speaks to chaos in the policy sphere.” Mr. Elson said Mr. Trump acted more like the typical entrepreneur than an experienced manager. “A problem with entrepreneurs is that people get tired of it and they move on,” he said. “People just get worn out. At some point you need a real manager. A lot of entrepreneurs sell their businesses when they reach a certain size and they realize they can’t manage them.” Would naming Mr. Cohn as chief of staff ameliorate the problem? Despite disenchantment with Mr. Kelly and his handling of the Porter situation, no one I interviewed thinks Mr. Cohn could fundamentally change the dynamic in the Trump White House any more than Mr. Kelly has. Mr. Cohn is now basking in the afterglow of the tax legislation, which seems to be growing in popularity with the public. His supporters point to the first-rate team he assembled at the National Economic Council as evidence that he — perhaps alone among top White House officials — could attract and retain talent. He enjoys good relations with Congress. But if Mr. Cohn became Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, he would have to sublimate his own beliefs to the president’s agenda. As one former White House official told me, “He can’t pull another Charlottesville,” referring to Mr. Cohn’s efforts last summer to publicly distance himself from the president’s racially charged comments while still working for him. Thanks to that incident, Mr. Cohn has already fallen from favor once, and his current rehabilitation may not last. People like Mr. Trump “have friends for a day,” Mr. Elson said. “That’s another quality of the entrepreneur. Like it or not, it’s part of what makes them successful.” While Mr. Cohn has influential supporters at the White House, talk of his possible elevation has prompted plenty of opposition, too, especially from representatives of Mr. Trump’s populist base. Mr. Cohn is, after all, a longtime Manhattan Democrat. A White House spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Mr. Cohn. In any event, Mr. Trump may be oblivious to the staff turnover and widespread vacancies in the executive branch, and indifferent to calls to replace Mr. Kelly. “I don’t think Trump thinks much about management philosophy,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “He ran for president as a lark, and look at him now. For him it’s all upside.”",7217
5a975406410cf7000162e8c3,2018-03-01T01:14:41+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/jared-kushner-apollo-citigroup-loans.html,Business,"Early last year, a private equity billionaire started paying regular visits to the White House. Joshua Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration officials on infrastructure policy. During that period, he met on multiple occasions with Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, said three people familiar with the meetings. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris. The job never materialized, but in November, Apollo lent $184 million to Mr. Kushner’s family real estate firm, Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper. Even by the standards of Apollo, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, the previously unreported transaction with the Kushners was a big deal: It was triple the size of the average property loan made by Apollo’s real estate lending arm, securities filings show. It was one of the largest loans Kushner Companies received last year. An even larger loan came from Citigroup, which lent the firm and one of its partners $325 million to help finance a group of office buildings in Brooklyn. That loan was made in the spring of 2017, shortly after Mr. Kushner met in the White House with Citigroup’s chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, according to people briefed on the meeting. The two men talked about financial and trade policy and did not discuss Mr. Kushner’s family business, one person said. There is little precedent for a top White House official meeting with executives of companies as they contemplate sizable loans to his business, say government ethics experts. “This is exactly why senior government officials, for as long back as I have any experience, don’t maintain any active outside business interests,” said Don Fox, the former acting director of the Office of Government Ethics during the Obama administration and, before that, a lawyer for the Air Force and Navy during Republican and Democratic administrations. “The appearance of conflicts of interest is simply too great.” The White House referred questions to Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, who did not dispute that the meetings between Mr. Kushner and the executives took place. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Lowell, said in a statement that Mr. Kushner “has met with hundreds of business people.” He said that Mr. Kushner “has taken no part of any business, loans or projects with or for” Kushner Companies since joining the White House and that he has followed ethics advice. Christine Taylor, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said Mr. Kushner’s White House role had not affected the company’s relationships with financial institutions. “Stories like these attempt to make insinuating connections that do not exist to disparage the financial institutions and companies involved,” she said. An Apollo spokesman, Charles V. Zehren, said Mr. Harris was not involved in the decision to loan money to Kushner Companies. He said the loan “went through the firm’s standard approval process.” A Citigroup spokeswoman, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, said Kushner Companies had been a bank client since before the election and that the relationship had no connection to Mr. Kushner’s White House role. She said Citigroup negotiated the 2017 loan with Kushner Companies’ business partner, a real estate developer. Mr. Kushner’s tenure in the White House has been dogged by questions about conflicts of interest between his government work and his family business, in which he remains heavily invested. Mr. Kushner steers American policy in the Middle East, for example, but his family company continues to do deals with Israeli investors. This blurring of lines is now a potential liability for Mr. Kushner, who recently lost his top-secret security clearance amid worries from some United States officials that foreign governments might try to gain influence with the White House by doing business with Mr. Kushner. Investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election, have asked questions about Mr. Kushner’s interactions with potential investors from overseas, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Kushner’s firm has sought investments from the Chinese insurer Anbang and from the former prime minister of Qatar. Mr. Mirijanian, the spokesman for Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, said that Mr. Mueller had not sought from the Kushner Companies or Mr. Kushner “any information or document concerning any business dealing either has had.” Mr. Kushner resigned as chief executive of Kushner Companies when he joined the White House last January, and he sold a small portion of his stake in the company to a trust controlled by his mother. But he retained the vast majority of his interest in Kushner Companies. His real estate holdings and other investments are worth as much as $761 million, according to government ethics filings. They are likely worth much more, because that estimate has his firm’s debt subtracted from the value of his holdings. The company has done at least $7 billion of deals in the past decade. Public filings show that Mr. Kushner still owns part of the company that received the Apollo loan. The loan was used to refinance a Chicago skyscraper that is the Midwest headquarters for AT&T. Mr. Kushner also still holds a stake in the entity that owns the Brooklyn buildings and received the loan from Citigroup. Federal ethics regulations restrict government employees from participating in some matters that involve companies with which the official is seeking “a business, contractual or other financial relationship that involves other than a routine consumer transaction.” Mr. Fox, the ethics expert, said Mr. Kushner risked violating the regulations in his meetings with Citigroup and Apollo executives. “Why does Jared have to take the meeting?” he asked. “Is there not somebody else who doesn’t have these financial entanglements who can brainstorm freely with these folks?” The Trump administration no longer publicly discloses logs of visitors to the White House. In February, the White House settled litigation with Public Citizen, a nonprofit organization, and agreed to disclose some of that information. Mr. Kushner has also met at the White House with Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone, which in the past has lent money to Kushner Companies for several projects, though all before the election. Until August, Mr. Schwarzman was the head of a White House business advisory council. “Blackstone has not done any business with Kushner Companies since the election, nor has Steve ever discussed private business matters with Mr. Kushner,” said a Blackstone spokeswoman. All of the executives who met with Mr. Kushner have lots to gain or lose in Washington. Apollo has sought ways to benefit from the White House’s possible infrastructure plan. And its executives, including Mr. Harris, had tens of millions of dollars personally at stake in the tax overhaul that was making its way through Washington last year. Citigroup, one of the country’s largest banks, is heavily regulated by federal agencies and, like other financial companies, is trying to get the government to relax its oversight of the industry. Mr. Kushner has reported owning hundreds of partnerships, limited liability companies and other entities, but he is not required to disclose the lifeblood of any real estate firm’s business: its lenders and outside investors. Some of the lenders can be pieced together through public records. The Apollo loan is disclosed in Chicago mortgage filings, which list the lender as “ACREFI Holdings J-I, LLC.” That vehicle is owned by Apollo’s real estate investment trust, securities filings show. The loans’ interest rates and other key provisions are not disclosed. Kushner Companies bought the Chicago building in 2007. Apollo, best known for investing in companies such as Caesars Entertainment and Norwegian Cruise Lines, was founded by Mr. Harris, Marc Rowan and its current chief executive, Leon Black. Mr. Black and Mr. Kushner sat next to each other at the 2016 US Open, a few months before the presidential election. Mr. Harris, a co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils, is Apollo’s senior managing director. He also is an adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Early last year, the White House enlisted Mr. Harris and other executives to advise the administration on infrastructure policy. Over a period of months, Mr. Harris met regularly with Mr. Kushner and other White House officials. Apollo made the loan to Kushner Companies on Nov. 1, 2017, according to public records. Apollo does not make real estate loans directly. Instead, it makes them through a so-called real estate investment trust, called Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance. The trust is a publicly traded company with its own set of shareholders. It is managed by Apollo, which charges the trust management fees, and has no employees of its own. One of the largest investors in Apollo’s real estate trust is the Qatari government’s investment fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. Mr. Kushner’s firm previously sought a $500 million investment from the former head of that Qatari fund for its headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. That investment never materialized. Shortly after Kushner Companies received the loan from Apollo, the private equity firm emerged as a beneficiary of the tax cut package that the White House championed. Mr. Trump backed down from his earlier pledge to close a loophole that permits private equity managers to pay taxes on the bulk of their income at rates that are roughly half of ordinary income tax rates. The tax law left the loophole largely intact.",9817
5a975304410cf7000162e8bc,2018-03-01T01:10:21+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/wells-fargo-fraud-closing-accounts.html,Business,"When signs of fraud appear on a customer’s account, such as a counterfeit check or an unauthorized withdrawal, a bank is required by law to investigate whether criminal activity has occurred. Wells Fargo had a simpler solution, according to a former employee: Close the account and drop the customer. Matthew Valles, a former fraud investigator for Wells Fargo in Portland, Ore., said the bank fired him in January in retaliation for his internal complaints about “hundreds” of mishandled fraud investigations. On Wednesday, he sued the bank and his former manager, alleging that they violated whistle-blower laws. Jim Seitz, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said, “We take seriously the concerns of current and former team members and investigate them thoroughly, and we are reviewing the legal complaint that was filed this afternoon.” Mr. Valles’s claims, combined with dozens of customer complaints to a federal regulator currently investigating the bank’s handling of fraud investigations, add to a pile of problems for Wells Fargo. Early in February, the Federal Reserve chided the bank for “widespread consumer abuses” and forbade it to grow any larger until it shaped up. Mr. Valles is the first Wells Fargo insider to publicly offer up more details on an issue that surfaced last year in a brief few lines in a regulatory filing by the bank. Wells Fargo disclosed in August that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was looking into whether customers had been harmed by the bank’s practice of freezing and often closing accounts after it or its customers detected signs of fraud. When a bank receives a fraud claim or detects suspicious activity, it typically assigns an investigator to piece together what happened. If the bank determines that the customer was an innocent victim, it will usually help him or her try to recover the missing money. But if the bank finds signs that the customer has engaged in illegal activities, like money laundering or fraud, it is supposed to report the issue to law enforcement and close the customer’s accounts. Many Wells Fargo customers, however, have complained that the bank was too quick to freeze or close accounts after signs of fraud — even if they themselves reported the suspicious activity. The consumer bureau’s complaints database contains dozens of reports from aggrieved customers who said their accounts had been shut down after they were victimized. Some customers who unknowingly deposited fake checks, for instance, said their accounts had then been terminated, often with little warning or explanation. That can temporarily block customers’ access to their funds — and make it more difficult to recover any money they lost. Wells Fargo said it was working with regulators on the matter. “As always, our goal is to protect our customers and the bank from fraud, and we want to do so in ways that minimize the risk and impact on our customers,” Mr. Seitz, the bank spokesman, said. Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo’s chief executive, said at an investor conference in December that the bank was reviewing its procedures for handling accounts with signs of suspicious activity. According to Mr. Valles’s lawsuit, it was standard practice at Wells’s Portland office to close customer accounts rather than investigate the suspicious activity. Instead of looking into fraud claims, the bank would instead “save money by simply closing accounts under the pretext of a ‘business decision,’” Mr. Valles said in his complaint, filed in Oregon’s Multnomah County Circuit Court. “Improperly closing customer accounts in this manner ensured that customers, not Wells Fargo, were left to absorb the costs of fraudulent activities and unauthorized withdrawals from their checking and savings accounts,” Mr. Valles’s complaint said. Mr. Valles, 30, worked at Wells Fargo for seven years, mostly in the fraud department in Salt Lake City, and transferred to the Portland office in 2014. He said he had first complained to the company’s management about the account closings the next year. Last month, Wells Fargo fired him, saying he had violated a security policy by leaving his notebook, which contained internal case numbers, on his desk overnight. It was the last in a string of reprimands that Mr. Valles said he had received from the bank after he complained — a response that he said constituted retaliation. Despite the acrimony surrounding his departure from the bank, Mr. Valles said Wells Fargo had shown signs of progress in recent months. Soon after the bank’s disclosure of the consumer bureau’s investigation, a new group of people arrived to the Portland office, he said. They set up new computers and put up an “Audit Department” sign over their section of the office. After that, employees stopped using the blanket “business decision” justification for closing accounts and began conducting more thorough investigations, Mr. Valles said. If they did decide that an account had to be closed, he said, they cited more specific evidence of fraudulent acts, such as a counterfeit check or an unauthorized electronic deposit. “They’re working on fixing the problems,” Mr. Valles said. “A lot needed to be done.” But those changes will not help customers whose accounts have already been affected, like Michael and Mary Ellen Mervis, a couple who had accounts with Wells Fargo for decades. In 2015, they discovered that one of their accountants had removed a six-figure sum from their checking account without their consent over the course of several years. The Mervises filed a police report in Milwaukee, where they lived at the time, and alerted the bank. Soon after, Wells Fargo told them that it was closing their checking and brokerage accounts and would not let them open new deposit accounts with the bank. The Mervises protested. The bank responded by noting its “responsibilities to oversee and manage risks in its banking operations,” and said the decision was final. That forced them to seek out a new bank and move over their assets, and still left them on their own to pursue their missing money. The accountant was eventually convicted of theft and ordered to pay restitution, but they still haven’t been made whole. “We got a hold of a lady in the fraud department, and she said this happened to a lot of people who filed fraud complaints,” Mr. Mervis said. “We were horrified. The bank had this attitude that if something went wrong, instead of trying to fix it, they were just going to run you over with the stagecoach and be done with you.”",6515

During the early years of the Obama administration, when there was a brief warming of relations, Exxon Mobil signed an exploration deal with the Russians. Exxon and Rosneft, which is only half-owned by the Russian government but state-run, agreed to invest $3.2 billion to search for oil in deepwater fields in the Arctic and elsewhere. After Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the United States and its European allies applied several sanctions on Moscow, eventually freezing Exxon’s investments. In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Exxon said that it had decided late last year to abandon the ventures this year and would take an after-tax loss of $200 million. “The corporation and its affiliates continue to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations,” the company said. With its investments already frozen by the sanctions, it was not clear what current activities, if any, Exxon’s move affected. The company has operations in Russia that are allowed under the sanctions, including an oil and gas production venture on Sakhalin, an island in the Siberian Arctic, and has had a business presence there for roughly a quarter-century. An Exxon spokesman said the company would have no comment beyond the filing. In any case, the move sends a signal, said David Goldwyn, who was the State Department’s top energy diplomat early in the Obama administration. “It’s a sign that the company realizes that U.S.-Russia relations and in particular sanctions are not likely to change soon,” he said. “They are an enormous source of friction with the government, and it is better business for them to steer their business away from sanctioned activities.” In July, Exxon sued the Treasury Department after it was fined $2 million for violating the Russia sanctions. The company had signed agreements with Igor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive and a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, when he was under sanctions. The company argued that government guidance had indicated that Mr. Sechin was blacklisted for personal conduct, not in his role as the oil company executive. Under the last four years of sanctions, Exxon and other Western oil companies have been prevented from using their technological expertise to help Rosneft’s oil and gas development. Stymied by the sanctions, Exxon was forced to look elsewhere for new reserves. It is investing heavily in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, and off the shores of several developing countries, including Guyana. The sanctions forced Rosneft, too, to look beyond Russia for new reserves. The Russians have helped Venezuela and its state oil company avert a financial collapse with new loans. In recent years, Rosneft has increasingly become a foreign-policy tool of the Kremlin, embarrassing its Western oil company partners. Long a financial bulwark of the Russian government, it has more recently been investing heavily in sensitive countries like Cuba, China and Vietnam, along with Venezuela.",3191
5a974697410cf7000162e8a4,2018-03-01T00:17:22+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/economy/bitcoin-electricity-productivity.html,Business,"WASHINGTON — A manufacturing start-up recently announced plans to move into a shuttered aluminum factory in upstate New York, taking advantage of abundant cheap electricity from the St. Lawrence River. Instead of smelting aluminum, however, the company plans to turn that power into Bitcoins. Money is supposed to be a means of buying things. Now, the nation’s hottest investment is buying money. And the investment rush is raising questions about whether one reason for the slow pace of economic growth in recent years is that the nation is busy distracting itself. While Bitcoin mining may not be labor intensive, it diverts time, energy and capital from other, more productive activities that economists say could fuel faster growth. “It appears that much of our evolving digital infrastructure is devoted to activities, like the proliferation of cybercoins, that are worse than frivolous,” said James McAndrews, the former head of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By a wide range of measures, America has a productivity problem. The economy is growing slowly, and almost 20 percent of adults in their prime working years are neither working nor trying to find work. Americans who do have jobs are less likely to start their own companies. Even the most basic kind of production is in decline. Americans are having less sex and making fewer babies. Some economists see evidence that people are playing video games instead of going to work, logging on instead of getting it on, and plowing a growing share of their time, capital and natural resources into virtual products like social media, games and the latest fad: virtual currencies. Bitcoin, the largest virtual currency, is a particularly voracious consumer of resources because new Bitcoins are distributed in a kind of lottery where each ticket is purchased with electricity. Bitcoin miners compete for the coins by submitting answers to difficult math problems. Instead of solving the problems, miners use computers to submit a flood of guesses. This can be lucrative: Each Bitcoin is currently valued at about $10,550. Believers insist it is a worthwhile endeavor. They describe Bitcoin as a superior currency that will eventually come into wide use, and they predict even broader applications for blockchains, the digital bookkeeping method used to record ownership of Bitcoins and to verify transactions. But Bitcoin remains so hard to use that a major Bitcoin conference in January had to stop accepting Bitcoin. It is, in practice, a speculative investment, like gold. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said mining gold was a better use of resources, because even if it lost value, it could be used to fill teeth. “Once the Bitcoin power is burned, it is never coming back,” he said. Colin L. Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., also sees it as a public nuisance. The city was guaranteed a fixed supply of cheap electricity as part of the construction of power-generating dams on the St. Lawrence in the 1950s. Bitcoin mining companies are plugging into that power supply like a swarm of hungry mosquitoes. Mr. Read said that Bitcoin mining now consumes about 10 percent of the city’s power, and that is forcing Plattsburgh to buy a growing amount of extra electricity on the open market, at rates up to 100 times higher than its base cost. Mr. Read, who is also an economics professor, said he would rather sell the city’s supply of cheap power to companies employing large numbers of people. Mold-Rite Plastics, which makes bottle caps, also uses about 10 percent of the city’s power, but it employs about 200 people. The mining companies? “They hire a security guard,” he said. “And a guy who comes when something breaks.” David Bowman, who describes himself as Plattsburgh’s first Bitcoin miner — “I started a long time ago, around 2014,” he said — started with a handful of computers. Now he has 20 machines. A few years ago, he rented a room in an old paper warehouse, where he runs the specialized hard drives around the clock. They sit side-by-side on wire racks, fans whirring to dissipate the heat. About half a dozen other mining companies have since moved into the same building. Mr. Bowman, who is from Plattsburgh, said he sympathizes with the mayor’s concerns. He is the only employee of his company, and he is presently a full-time medical student on the Caribbean island of Grenada. But Bitcoin mining paid his college tuition and it is paying for medical school. And he doesn’t see that Plattsburgh has better options. “The place needs all the jobs they can get,” he said, although his company employs no one beyond him. He does pay fees to an investor-owned company that operates and maintains the machines and has one employee. Other governments also are grappling with the merits of virtual currencies. Enel, the largest European power company, said earlier this month it would not sell electricity to a virtual miner, citing environmental concerns. “Enel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing,” the company, partly owned by the Italian government, said in a statement. Some Bitcoin miners emphasize their reliance on renewable energy, but the energy they use might otherwise be put to other purposes. Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world’s largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies. Some American utilities, too, are hungry for new customers. Domestic demand for electricity is in decline as power-hungry industries, like aluminum smelting, have moved to other countries and households are increasingly using LED light bulbs. “They’re thankful that anyone still wants to use energy,” said Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, an Oregon energy consultancy. And plenty of places are hungry for jobs — even the relatively few jobs that virtual mining brings. Massena, the town with the shuttered smelter, is about two hours from Plattsburgh. It also enjoys a guaranteed supply of cheap electricity, but it has lost several of its major employers, including the smelter and a General Motors factory. The New York Power Authority reserves 490 megawatts of low-cost power for industrial users in Franklin, Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties, the northern tier that includes Massena. The decline of local industry means only 52 percent of that power is currently committed, which is why officials were delighted when a company called Coinmint proposed to install 16,000 computers in the old aluminum building. The company, which is still negotiating contracts, told the power authority it would employ 150 people. Employers historically have created 30.5 jobs in exchange for each megawatt of low-cost electricity, according to the power authority, while Coinmint is proposing to create just new 10 jobs per megawatt. But 10 is more than none. “The plan is to get anybody here that you can,” said Steven D. O’Shaughnessy, Massena’s town supervisor. “I have said all along, I’ll take whatever I can.”",7439
5a974642410cf7000162e8a3,2018-03-01T00:15:58+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/walmart-gun-age-increase.html,Business,"Two of the nation’s leading gun sellers, Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, took steps on Wednesday to limit their sales of firearms, thrusting themselves into the middle of the polarizing national debate over gun control. Walmart, the biggest gun seller, announced late in the afternoon that it would not sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age. It also said it would no longer sell items resembling assault-style rifles, including toys and air guns. Early in the day, Dick’s said it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores. The retailer also said that it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and would also require any gun buyer to be at least 21, regardless of local laws. Under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles and other firearms. The dual announcements, made two weeks after 17 students and staff members were killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., were among the most significant actions taken on guns by corporate America. Both retailers said their decision were a response to the shooting. Earlier, President Trump met at the White House with a bipartisan group of lawmakers and called for a series of gun control measures, some of which the National Rifle Association has vigorously opposed. Walmart and Dick’s acted after a number of major companies moved last week to dissociate themselves from the N.R.A. Hertz car rental, MetLife insurance and Delta Air Lines, among others, publicly ended their relationships with the organization. In a news release late Wednesday, Walmart noted that in 2015 it discontinued the sale of  high-powered rifles, including AR-15-style weapons, in its stores in the United States. But at the time, Walmart sidestepped any controversy involving gun politics, attributing its decision to lower customer demand for the military-style rifles. This time, Walmart directly linked its action to the shooting in Florida, saying, “In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales.” Top Walmart executives made the decision and then informed the board, a company spokesman said. Walmart sells guns in roughly half of its nearly 4,000 supercenters, the company said, but the sheer scale of its customer base gives its decision significant heft. Every week, more than 150 million people around the country shop at Walmart. Dick’s decision was announced by Edward Stack, the 63-year-old chief executive whose father founded the store in 1948. Mr. Stack made clear that he was deliberately steering his company directly into the storm over gun reform. “When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset,” Mr. Stack said in an interview. “We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘Enough is enough.’ It got to us.” He added, “We’re going to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.” The decision drew immediate — and passionate — reaction on social media. By midday, the number of Twitter messages containing Dick’s name had jumped 12,000 percent from the average over the previous 10 days, according to Sprout Social, a social media management, advocacy and analytics software platform. About 79 percent of the tweets had a positive sentiment, Sprout Social said, including supportive messages from Hollywood actors and actresses. But the company’s critics posted their plans to no longer shop at the retailer, some closing their tweets with “#boycott.” Investors did not appear to worry about a backlash, as Dick’s stock spent much of Wednesday trading about 1.8 percent higher before finishing up 0.69 percent. Mr. Stack said Dick’s hoped to move the conversation beyond social media and into the political realm. As part of its stance, the company is calling on elected officials to pass what it called “common sense gun reform”: raising the minimum age to buy guns to 21, banning assault-type weapons and so-called bump stocks, and conducting broader background checks that include mental-health information and previous interactions with law enforcement. This is not the first time that Dick’s has made changes in response to a school massacre. In 2012, after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Dick’s removed assault-style rifles from its main stores. But a few months later, the company began carrying the firearms at its outdoor and hunting retail chain, Field & Stream. As of Wednesday morning, the company said, AR-15-style and other semiautomatic rifles will no longer be sold in its 35 Field & Stream stores or on its websites. And this time, Mr. Stack added, the changes will be permanent. Mr. Stack said the retailer had begun scouring its purchase records shortly after the identity of the suspected Parkland killer, Nikolas Cruz, became known. The company soon discovered that it had legally sold a gun to Mr. Cruz in November, though it was not the type used in the school shooting. “But it came to us that we could have been a part of this story,” Mr. Stack said. “We said, ‘We don’t want to be a part of this any longer.’” That response raised rounds of discussions with the company’s top executives and its directors, all of whom backed the decision to take a stand, Mr. Stack said. He said Dick’s remained a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and would continue to sell a variety of sport and hunting firearms. Although he has never been a member of the N.R.A., Mr. Stack said, he is a gun owner and enjoys trapshooting. But when it comes to selling guns to individuals under 21 or stocking assault-style rifles, Mr. Stack said, his company is done. “We don’t want to be a part of a mass shooting,” he said. The company said that it had not decided what to do with ts inventory of assault-style rifles but that they would not be sold in the marketplace. Legal experts said they saw no likely challenges to Dick’s decision to stop selling assault-style rifles. But the decision to stop selling weapons to anyone under 21, however, could be tested in court. Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the School of Law of the University of California, Los Angeles, said Dick’s could be challenged in lawsuits claiming a violation of laws that bar age discrimination. Although federal civil rights laws do not apply, some states, including New York, prohibit businesses from denying goods and services on the basis of age. “Don’t be surprised if an aggressive attorney general of a gun-friendly state brings an age-discrimination claim against Dick’s,” Professor Winkler wrote in an email response to questions. The company said that it believed its decision was in accordance with the law and that it was instituting the policy immediately.",6827
5a973ae9410cf7000162e887,2018-02-28T23:27:31+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/energy-environment/debbie-dooley-energy.html,Business,"LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. — Debbie Dooley’s conservative profile seems impeccable. The gun-owning daughter of a Baptist preacher, she was an early organizer for the Tea Party movement. She voted for President Trump and still supports him. But when it comes to energy, her independent streak sends her down a different path: She takes issue with some of Mr. Trump’s signature positions, goes up against some of the nation’s biggest utility companies and often crosses conventional partisan lines. Ms. Dooley opposes the tariff the president imposed on solar-panel imports in January. As for coal, which Mr. Trump has championed, it will never “be the king it once was,” she said. She accepts that human activity is causing climate change — and worries that it will threaten the health of the next generation, including her 9-year-old grandson, who has asthma. To her, those beliefs are consistent with the rest of her worldview. “We should be focusing on the technologies of the future, not the dinosaur technology of the past,” Ms. Dooley said. “Our energy grid is vulnerable to attack. Rooftop solar keeps us safe. People like solar.” What’s more, she contends that embracing clean energy affirms the populist beliefs the Tea Party espouses. The monopoly control of utilities over energy supplies stands in contrast to the free market, she said, while solar and wind power represent energy freedom. Over the last five years, she has unabashedly linked arms with environmental groups championed by the left, like the Sierra Club. And on Thursday, she is set to appear at an event in San Francisco with a member of the Democratic National Committee’s executive committee — Christine Pelosi, daughter of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader vilified by the right. “You can have success if you have environmentalists look at saving the environment as an ethic, and evangelicals as saving God’s creation,” Christine Pelosi said. “You don’t have to agree on everything.” While Ms. Dooley’s efforts are still an anomaly in conservative circles, she has formed a group called the Green Tea Coalition to rally more conservatives around renewable energy. “Debbie is being a little bit of a trailblazer on the climate issue, but she was always a trailblazer on clean energy,” said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, an environmental advocacy group based in Knoxville, Tenn. Ms. Dooley sees the Trump administration’s tariffs on solar-panel imports as the latest in a series of impediments to clean energy. A former information technology systems analyst — “probably why I am so drawn to innovative energy technology” — she is particularly critical of policies that make it more difficult for consumers to become more self-reliant for their energy. At 59, from her rental home here in the Atlanta suburbs, she works full time on utility, clean energy and climate issues with a total budget of $90,000 a year, using funds from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation and other donors. She has worked to persuade legislators and regulators in her state to embrace measures that would foster greater use of solar power. But it wasn’t easy. “I didn’t just put my head in the sand like an ostrich,” Ms. Dooley said. “Let’s face it: They had to come kicking and screaming.” She is also having a wider impact, taking on some of the nation’s largest utilities. Proponents of residential solar power like Ms. Dooley accuse utility companies and the energy industry at large of waging war on efforts to free consumers from their power companies, even if only for a slightly lower electric bill. For the utilities, which are facing flat or declining consumption, residential solar power threatens the bottom line. They have responded by spending tens of millions of dollars to combat consumers’ efforts to untether themselves from the electric grid. A new study by the Sustainable Investments Institute, a nonprofit group that conducts research on efforts to influence corporate boards, found that utilities had spent $50 million between 2011 and 2016 to block clean energy in seven states: Alaska, California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon and Washington. Despite calling itself the Sunshine State, Florida lags behind states like New York and New Jersey in residential solar installations. But a 2016 campaign resulted in overwhelming voter approval of a constitutional amendment to provide a property tax exemption for solar installations. In a referendum months later, voters rejected a utility-backed measure, presented as pro-solar, that would have actually allowed new fees on home solar users. Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy spent a combined $14.8 million on the referendum campaign. Ms. Dooley worked to counter their efforts, standing with environmentalists and business groups and helping win support from the Christian Coalition and self-identified libertarians. Her side prevailed. And aided by the property-tax break and lower solar-panel prices, Florida more than doubled the number of residential solar projects in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Clean-energy proponents are determined to build on such successes. According to research by the University of California, Irvine, the California Institute of Technology and the Carnegie Institution for Science, 80 percent of the nation’s power needs can be met by solar and wind. Although she backed the Florida tax break, Ms. Dooley said she was convinced that alternative energy sources could hold their own without government intervention. “I think solar and wind have progressed to the point that they don’t need subsidies,” she said. “The government shouldn’t pick winners and losers.” That conservative shading to her argument might appeal to Republicans. Still, red states — particularly in the South — have been resistant to residential solar power, a review of data from the solar industry organization has found. If they support solar power at all, their utilities tend to want to produce it themselves. Of the 10 states with the most residential solar power, eight voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Of the 10 with the most solar capacity at utility scale, six voted for Mr. Trump. Randy Wheeless, a spokesman for Duke Energy, insists that utilities are embracing cleaner technologies, noting that a decision by the company to forgo building a nuclear plant in Florida included plans for new solar farms. He said Duke was one of the few utilities in the country to file comments opposing the solar-panel tariff. Mr. Wheeless also said Duke had recently been adding 300 residential solar customers in Florida each month. But Lauren McDonald Jr., a member of the Georgia Public Service Commission who led efforts to bring more solar to his state, said the utilities simply didn’t want to depart from the business model they had operated under for a century, despite the changing world of energy. “Their business is to generate electricity, transport it and to sell it,” Mr. McDonald said. “Anything that might come into play that might derail that agenda, they don’t give up easily.” Neither, it seems, does Ms. Dooley. When she talks about clean energy and climate change, she clutches her cellphone and pulls up a picture of her grandson, Ayden Sides. “I fully believe we should be good stewards of what God gave us,” Ms. Dooley said.",7409
5a9711df410cf7000162e80d,2018-02-28T20:32:26+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/media/spotify-ipo.html,Business,"Spotify has already won over the music industry, and listeners worldwide, with an online streaming service that makes millions of songs instantly available. Now, it is ready to test its business model on Wall Street. On Wednesday, the company filed a prospectus to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange, an indication of the imminent arrival of one of the most anticipated technology stocks in years. It was also a signal of the maturation of the streaming market that has already begun to revive the long-struggling music industry. Instead of a traditional initial public offering, Spotify will, as expected, pursue a direct listing of its shares, an unusual process in which no new stock is issued — and therefore no money is raised. However, existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market. But because Spotify is eschewing Wall Street banks to manage the raising of new capital, the listing could face a rockier reception in the markets. Those banks typically spend weeks assessing investor demand for a company’s shares and try to match the amount that hits the market to ensure the shares are supported. According to the prospectus, investors trading Spotify’s shares in private transactions have valued the company as highly as $23 billion. Spotify’s shares will be traded under the ticker symbol SPOT, but there is no indication of when that will begin. The company, showing no shortage of ambition, said that its mission was “to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators.” For the music industry, Spotify — and the streaming model it has championed — has been a powerful engine. After more than a decade of decline, the global music market began to turn around in about 2015, just as streaming began to take hold. In the United States, for example, streaming now accounts for about two-thirds of recorded music revenues, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and SoundCloud have become the new outlets where stars develop and hits are minted. Even so, many artists remain skeptical of the streaming economy, which heavily rewards mainstream hits but has drawn complaints from other songwriters and musicians, particularly those outside the sphere of pop, who feel they are not being adequately compensated for their work. Spotify’s prospectus is the most detailed disclosure the company has given about its business. According to the filing, Spotify, which began its streaming service in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States three years later, had nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2017, up 38.6 percent from the year before. In 2016, it had grown by 52 percent. By the end of 2017, Spotify, whose full name is Spotify Technology, had 159 million active users, including 71 million who pay for subscriptions; the rest, using the “freemium” model that has become Spotify’s marketing hallmark, get free access to music but are subjected to advertisements. As quickly as Spotify has grown, though, so have its losses. Last year, it had a net loss of $1.5 billion, up from about $650 million the year before. Its largest expense, by far, is the cost of licenses from record companies and music publishers. The prospectus also highlights Spotify’s successes, and its value to the music industry. Through the end of last year, the company had paid more than $10 billion in music royalties since its inception, and its “churn” — a measure of how many paying users cancel each month — has been steadily declining, to 5.5 percent in 2017 from 7.7 percent in 2015. The largest stakes are owned by its two founders: Daniel Ek, the chief executive and the company’s public face, and Martin Lorentzon, who holds no executive position. In addition to their shares, they also have “beneficiary certificates” granting them extra voting rights. In total, Mr. Ek has 37.3 percent voting power over the company, and Mr. Lorentzon 43.1 percent, according to the prospectus. The major record labels also own minority stakes in the company, as a result of licensing deals struck over the years. Sony has the largest, with 5.7 percent; the others were not disclosed. Spotify’s major competitor is Apple, whose co-founder Steve Jobs had long disdained music subscriptions. Apple finally entered the streaming subscription business in 2015 with Apple Music, and recently said that it had 36 million paying users. But according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, Apple Music has been outpacing Spotify in its growth in paid subscribers in the United States. The market for public offerings has been robust so far this year. Through late February, 30 companies listed their shares publicly on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. At least some of the highly valued, privately held technology companies, known as unicorns, could move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity and sell shares publicly. Last week, for instance, the online file storage company Dropbox, valued by the private markets at about $10 billion, filed paperwork to raise up to $500 million in an initial public offering. But to convert that paper wealth into actual cash at top dollar, early-stage investors, company founders and employees with stock options need receptive public markets to buy their shares. If the public investors do not think the companies are worth as much as the small number of deep-pocketed investors who dominate the private markets, it could mean the large amounts of paper wealth could be vaporized once the company’s shares start trading. That’s effectively what happened last year, when some prominent public offerings fizzled once the shares were trading publicly. Shares of Snap, the start-up behind the popular Snapchat app, surged when it went public last March, but it has since had difficulty staying above its offering price of $17 a share. And the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June, is now trading at less than $3 a share. Given that it involves a direct listing, Spotify’s debut on the public markets has the potential to be even more volatile.",6399

Most applauded, including some gun owners. But others saw a public relations stunt on the day that school resumed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed two weeks ago. And some objected that their right to buy firearms was being attacked. The company also said it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and would not sell any gun to anyone younger than 21, regardless of local laws. “I’m a gun owner and I commend Dick’s for doing this.

5a96ee34410cf7000162e79c,2018-02-28T18:00:14+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/technology/paul-allen-ai-common-sense.html,Business,"SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft’s co-founder Paul Allen said Wednesday that he was pumping an additional $125 million into his nonprofit computer research lab for an ambitious new effort to teach machines “common sense.” The money for the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence will about double the lab’s budget over the next three years, helping to fund existing research as well as the new effort, called Project Alexandria. In the years and decades to come, the lab hopes to create a database of fundamental knowledge that humans take for granted but machines have always lacked. “To make real progress in A.I., we have to overcome the big challenges in the area of common sense,” said Mr. Allen, who founded the software giant Microsoft in the 1970s with Bill Gates. Today, machines can recognize nearby objects, identify spoken words, translate one language into another and mimic other human tasks with an accuracy that was not possible just a few years ago. These talents are readily apparent in the new wave of autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, smartphones and digital assistants. But these machines struggle with other basic tasks. Though Amazon’s Alexa does a good job of recognizing what you say, it cannot respond to anything more than basic commands and questions. When confronted with heavy traffic or unexpected situations, driverless cars just sit there. A.I. “recognizes objects, but can’t explain what it sees. It can’t read a textbook and understand the questions in the back of the book,” said Oren Etzioni, a former University of Washington professor who oversees the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. “It is devoid of common sense.” Success may require years or even decades of work — if it comes at all. Others have tried to digitize common sense, and the task has always proved too large. In the mid-1980s, Doug Lenat, a former Stanford University professor, with backing from the government and several of the country’s largest tech companies, started a project called Cyc. He and his team of researchers worked to codify all the simple truths that we learn as children, from “you can’t be in two places at the same time” to “when drinking from a cup, hold the open end up.” Thirty years later, Mr. Lenat and his team are still at work on this “common sense engine” — with no end in sight. Mr. Allen helped fund Cyc, and he believes it is time to take a fresh approach, he said, because modern technologies make it easier to build this kind of system. Mr. Lenat welcomed the new project. But he also warned of challenges: Cyc has burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, running into countless problems that were not evident when the project began. He called them “buzz saws.”",2737

Azam Ahmed, the Mexico bureau chief, who is based in Mexico City, discussed the tech he’s using. What are the most important tech tools that you’ve found for doing your job?  My phone and the various messaging apps that I use are the only truly indispensable technology I have. WhatsApp is probably the most widely used messaging service in Mexico. It’s pretty much the only way to get busy people to respond to you. Some sources use Telegram and Signal, so I do as well, like other reporters covering sensitive issues they don’t want monitored. My colleagues will laugh about this, but I also use a GPS watch when I’m going off the grid, to have my coordinates wherever I am. When I was previously in Kabul, Afghanistan, a few of the other reporters teased me for using it, but I’ve found it reassuring to always have my whereabouts available when I’m in remote areas without any service — especially if it’s a violent area or one where kidnapping is a possibility. On those same trips, I take a satellite phone and a Bgan, which is essentially a small transmitter that gets you internet when you’re in the middle of nowhere. And I have come to love the extra-long charging cable — I’m talking 10 to 15 feet. You find yourself in a crappy hotel with one outlet on the other end of the room, and you’ll know why. All of the above, however, are in an ideal world. Twice in the last two years I’ve been sent on breaking stories from vacation, without any of my tech tools. Once was in Haiti in 2016, after a devastating storm. And again last year, after a spate of hurricanes that passed through the Caribbean. You’ve written about how journalists in Mexico have been targeted with spyware and other tech. How, from what you’ve found, does the government in Mexico use tech? The government has a long history of heavy-handed surveillance, and its use of technology is just the latest iteration of that. There’s no doubt it is using technology for surveillance, nor is there any doubt that it is paying exorbitant sums for it, as seen by various contracts made public and emails related to the government’s purchases of Hacking Team software that leaked a few years back. How the government uses the technology, however, appears far less sophisticated. I often wonder if it even has the manpower and resources to review all the material it gathers from surveillance operations. It has this incredibly sophisticated spyware, and yet most signs indicate reckless use without real material gain. Sometimes it can feel as if the government bought a Lamborghini to race around a go-kart track. What do you do, in broad strokes, to keep your communications secure?  The least tech-forward thing you can imagine: I meet face to face with people. I tend to avoid messaging or talking about specific work targets on my main Mexican phone. I’m pretty sure I was sent Pegasus, the spyware purchased by the Mexican government, and though I’ve wiped that phone and replaced it, I’m cautious. I use the typical encrypted apps for communications and maintain several phones, which I use for different purposes. It’s annoying lugging all of them around, and I get funny looks at the airport when I toss three phones into the scanner basket. It’s also a pain keeping them all charged. How has the tech landscape changed in Mexico over the years? Is there a lot of tech start-up activity? Lots has been written about the booming tech scene in Mexico, in particular in the city of Guadalajara, which is the latest place to be given some kind of Silicon Valley moniker. There are a bunch of start-ups there, taking advantage of the tens of thousands of engineering graduates coming out of prestigious programs in Mexico every year. Is it a game-changer? I don’t know, to be honest. The entrepreneurs and officials here were trying to drum up support for recruiting foreign-born Silicon Valley engineers, to take advantage of President Trump’s immigration policies. Not sure that went anywhere past the headlines, though. What are the most popular kinds of websites or apps or gadgets in Mexico? Waze is especially popular in Mexico. In Mexico City, where I live, traffic is a force of nature. So if you don’t find the best way to get through it, you’re going to spend some nauseating hours stuck in the car. For me, and for a ton of others living here, Waze is essential unless you’re an old-school cabby who happens to know the city. Outside work, what gadget or software do you currently find yourself using a lot and why? I live a relatively low-tech existence. I’ve never been an early adopter of the latest tech “it” item; my phones are really the only technology I can’t function without. I did get a pair of Bose SoundSport wireless earbuds that are pretty awesome. The case doubles as a charging station, and they never fall out while I’m running. It’s also worth mentioning that they don’t look as ridiculous as the Apple wireless ones. As for apps: PayPal and banking apps to send and receive money and manage my finances, which can be a pain when living abroad. Find Friends is an app I got used to using in Kabul to track colleagues as they were on trips into dangerous areas. It gives you the GPS coordinates of anyone in your group who is using the app, to monitor his or her whereabouts. I still use that on occasion. Something has to be incredibly useful and life-altering for me to fold it into my daily life, and I haven’t found an app yet that I use every single day no matter where I am or what I’m doing. One reason is I don’t really have a fixed routine, given all the travel and the nature of foreign correspondence, where you are often in different places, covering different stories. The truth is I’m not really the ideal tech consumer.",5830
5a96d659410cf7000162e73d,2018-02-28T16:18:28+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/netherlands-plastic-supermarket.html,Business,"A supermarket in the Netherlands wants to make it easier on the planet and easier for its customers to avoid adding to the mountains of plastic waste generated every day. On Wednesday, the supermarket, Ekoplaza, an upmarket chain, introduced what it billed as the world’s first plastic-free aisle in a store in Amsterdam. There, shoppers found groceries, snacks and other sundries — but not an ounce of plastic. The items are packaged in compostable materials or in glass, metal or cardboard. Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet, an advocacy group that has pushed the concept, said the initiative was “a landmark moment for the global fight against plastic pollution.” The plastic-free aisle contains about 700 items, including meats, sauces, cereals, yogurt and chocolate. “It’s not just a marketing trick, it’s something we worked on for years,” Erik Does, the chief executive of Ekoplaza, said in an interview. The opening of the supermarket aisle comes as the idea of banning plastic, or at least making more of it recyclable, gains supporters around the world. In January, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain called for plastic-free aisles in supermarkets in a speech outlining a 25-year environmental plan. The same month, the European Union rolled out a plan to make all plastic on the European market recyclable by 2030. “If we don’t do anything about this, 50 years down the road, we will have more plastic than fish in the oceans,” Frans Timmermans, the vice president of the European Commission, the European Union’s executive body, told reporters in January. Items in the European Union’s cross hairs: drinking straws, plastic bottles, coffee cups and lids — none of which were available to shoppers browsing the new aisle in western Amsterdam on Wednesday. Plastic packaging has become so widespread as a result of its convenience and qualities of hygiene. But because of its light weight and ability to float, along with its increasing use in international garbage exports, plastic has become an ecological bane. “One man’s plastic food wrapper is another man’s problem,” Ms. Sutherland said. The proposals from the European Union and from Britain landed on the heels of a Chinese ban on all foreign plastic waste imports, which began in January. Rwanda has also begun a campaign that threatened public shaming and even prison time to tackle the plastics problem, making it illegal to import, produce, use or sell plastic bags and plastic packaging except within specific industries like hospitals and pharmaceuticals. The nation is one of more than 40 around the world that have banned, restricted or taxed the use of plastic bags, including France and Italy. In a study published last year, scientists estimated that 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic has been produced worldwide since the 1950s, when plastic began being mass produced. Of that, roughly 6.3 billion metric tons has been thrown away, 79 percent of it in landfills or in other parts of the environment. Only 9 percent of the discarded plastic has been recycled, according to the study, whose lead author is Roland Geyer of the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In the Netherlands, free plastic bags were banned two years ago, after a European Union directive was passed in 2015 to phase them out. At the time, the country of about 17 million used around three billion bags each year, most of which ended up in the trash. Ekoplaza has promised to expand the plastic-free idea to all of its 74 stores by the end of the year. Ms. Sutherland said, “There is absolutely no logic in wrapping something as fleeting as food in something as indestructible as plastic.”",3720
5a96bf56410cf7000162e6ff,2018-02-28T14:40:17+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/technology/personaltech/cheaper-smartphone.html,Business,"The evolution of the smartphone can be summed up by two trends: Phones just keep getting bigger. They are also getting pricier. The chief examples are phones from Apple and Samsung Electronics, the top handset makers. Samsung this week introduced the Galaxy S9, its new flagship smartphone, with starting prices of about $720 and, for a slightly larger screen, $840. Years ago, Galaxy phones started at about $650. Apple’s iPhone prices are also increasing. Last year, Apple released the iPhone 8 for $699, up from the $649 starting price of earlier iPhones. In addition, the company introduced the iPhone X, its first premium-tier handset, for $999. Rising prices make the smartphone one of the most expensive household products. But unlike televisions, which plummet in price and attract bargain hunters, many consumers are willing to up their spending on phones. “They become more and more essential to people’s everyday life, so price sensitivity just continues to erode,” said Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm. Yet plenty of people don’t want to splurge on a fancy phone every few years. Huawei, the Chinese manufacturer, was the No. 3 phone maker in the fourth quarter last year, IDC, a research firm, said. Sales of cheaper Honor smartphones and other low-end devices contributed to the company’s growth. And there’s a silver lining for those who want to spend less: Cheaper smartphones have never been better. If you spend between $200 and $300, you can get a capable, fast smartphone for basic tasks like placing calls, using maps and sending texts. Of course, there are trade-offs, like lower-quality screens and less impressive cameras. Is a budget phone right for you? Here’s an overview on the pros and cons of going cheap, with some phone recommendations from Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products. Let’s start with the downsides of buying a cheaper phone. ■ You won’t get the best camera. Budget phones lack the advanced camera sensors found on high-end smartphones. So if you go cheap, your phone camera probably won’t be very fast, won’t do a great job at taking photos in low light and will lack features like optical image stabilization, which helps photos remain clear even when your hands are shaky. ”The camera is a big one,” said Andrew Cunningham, a Wirecutter editor. “If you’re taking photos, especially in low light, performance is going to fall off a cliff.” ■ Obviously, you won’t get cutting-edge features like the infrared face recognition system on the iPhone X or the fancy stylus on Samsung’s big-screen Galaxy Note. You also won’t get the fastest computing processor, so your phone won’t be as capable of running games with heavy graphics. ■ You also won’t get the brightest and most vibrant display. The fanciest smartphones have OLED screens, which have better color accuracy and contrast. ■ You won’t get many software updates, which are important because they introduce new features and security enhancements. For phone makers, the priority is issuing big software updates to more powerful smartphones. At best, with a cheap Android phone you will probably get one major software update and a few security updates over 18 months. With all that said, there are plenty of benefits to buying a good budget phone. ■ You will get a decent camera. Many cheaper phones have high-resolution sensors that can take clear, rich photos. “A cheap phone today is going to have a better camera than a cheap phone from three years ago,” said Nathan Edwards, a senior editor for Wirecutter. “It’s not like they’re truly awful.” ■ You’ll get a good enough screen for reading websites, watching videos and looking at photos. Budget phones still use LCD, an older display technology that has greatly matured and still looks quite good. ■ Your phone will be fast enough for important tasks like placing calls, sending and receiving email, browsing the web and running lightweight apps. If you aren’t an app-aholic or a gamer, maybe that is all you will need. So here’s the upshot. There is a strong argument for spending more on your smartphone: If it is your most important technology tool for work and play, you should probably invest in a superior device. But if you want a phone only for basic tasks and you’re not in a hurry to adopt the latest and greatest technology, a cheaper phone may serve you well. Now comes the tough part: picking a good budget phone and avoiding the duds. Wirecutter tested 20 of the best budget smartphones over the last few years to highlight a few. Expect to spend roughly $200. Wirecutter’s top budget phone is Motorola’s Moto G5 Plus, which costs about $230. It has a high-quality camera, a good 5.2-inch screen, a fast fingerprint sensor and plenty of storage. The device also comes unlocked, meaning it works with all American carriers. (If you want to spend a bit more, you could buy the Moto X4, which is water-resistant and on sale for $300, down from $400.) Wirecutter also highlighted Huawei’s $200 Honor 7X, which has a better camera and bigger screen than the Moto G5 Plus. The downside is it runs an older version of the Android operating system, called Nougat. Another option, if you prefer iPhones, is to buy an older iPhone model. Apple is still selling the iPhone 6s, introduced in 2015, which is reasonably fast with a nice camera and a good screen. It costs $449 through Apple, but you may find it much cheaper elsewhere. What’s more, Apple typically supports its iPhones for about five years, so the 6s should continue to get software updates through 2020. “A lot of things you’d have to pay 600 or 700 bucks for three or four years ago, you’ll get for $200 or less now,” Mr. Cunningham said. “If you just want the basics, a budget phone is going to do just fine for most people.”",5820

Last year I opened a Facebook account, and as I entered my information I soon decided I didn’t want to continue. I deleted the app on my phone and tablet. Occasionally, I receive a “Welcome back to Facebook” message and realize I’ve not cut the cord. Is there way to sever this connection for good? Completely?  A. Removing the Facebook app from your mobile devices does not delete the user account connected with it. To fully sever your ties with the social network, you need to visit the site’s Account Deletion page and log back in; you can do this from a web browser if you do not want to download the mobile app again. Use the box on the page to officially request that Facebook delete your account. Facebook’s settings page also offers an account deactivation option, which removes your profile page from view but is not permanent. Accounts are reactivated when you log back in. If you deactivated your account and then started up a laptop that was set to automatically log into Facebook, your account may have revived itself. From your account settings page, you can see on which devices you are logged into Facebook and then log out if necessary. Logging in, then logging out of any forgotten devices and permanently deleting the account should cut your Facebook ties. (More active Facebook users can download an archive of the posts made while using the service by clicking the “Download a copy of your Facebook data” link on the account settings page.) If you deactivated the account and are sure no other devices were set to automatically log into Facebook, receiving “Welcome back” messages may mean Facebook is trying to re-engage you or that someone else is trying to get into your account. You can report the problem at facebook.com/hacked. Change the password of the mail account you used for Facebook and — to be safe — reset your Facebook password before deleting the account. Fake messages purporting to be from Facebook have been flying around the internet for years, so it is also possible you received a phishing attempt urging you to supply your account information to a fraudulent site. Late last year, Facebook announced that its users could see a list of official messages by clicking the link at the bottom of the Security and Login tab on the Settings page. If you see that Facebook has not sent you any legitimate messages, report the one you received to phish@facebook.com.",2406

It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday. The numbers are included in Spotify’s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing’s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, “consists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.” The filing says Spotify had €3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was €2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. “This decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,” the filing said. But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that. — Peter Eavis Accounting nerds delving into Spotify’s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy. Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of €324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled €179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda? It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung €439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year. — Peter Eavis The streaming music service filed its prospectus for a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, an unusual route that bypasses the traditional initial public offering process. Direct listings essentially move trading in a company’s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Wall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify’s listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street bankers are unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O. Spotify won’t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days. Here’s a look at the details: Ticker symbol: SPOT Price range for private shares in 2017:  $37.50-$125.00  Price range for private shares this year:  $90.00-$132.50 Valuation range in 2017: $6.3 billion to $20.9 billion Valuation range this year: $15.9 billion to $23.4 billion Valuation based on the midpoint of its 2018 price range: $19.7 billion Loss: €1.2 billion in 2017, up from €225 million in 2015 Operating loss: €378 million, compared with €235 million in 2015.

Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify’s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public. One of the U.S.’s biggest gun sellers, Dick’s Sporting Goods, said that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, as well as limit sales of any gun to those 21 and older. In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby. Dick’s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT: What’s next: Mr. Stack wants what he calls “common sense” changes to gun laws, like the steps his company is taking and broader universal background checks. Why it’s remarkable:  Other companies, big and small, continue to sever ties to the National Rifle Association. Delta has been openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans in Georgia after eliminating discounts for N.R.A. members. (Gun control is certainly a hot topic in the midterm election campaign.) And then there’s this: FedEx and UPS are feuding over ties to the N.R.A. Over five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero. Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest. The Pershing Square Capital Management chief told CNBC that his firm had finally exited the short bet. That’s after: • Mr. Ackman’s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet. • So did Carl Icahn, in one of the most prominent public spats in recent Wall Street history, before the two men made up. (That didn’t stop Mr. Icahn from continuing to bet on Herbalife.) How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high. But Mr. Ackman has found a new investment: United Technologies. Why? The hedge fund mogul told CNBC that he liked the company — which happens to be considering spinning off parts of itself as a way to get more value for the conglomerate’s shareholders. Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73. — Michael de la Merced For months, the former real estate investor’s inability to get a permanent top-secret security clearance has been a lightning rod for criticism. Now his interim credentials have been docked to secret and his West Wing portfolio clipped — and people are asking what happened. One thing that has come up, per the WaPo, citing unidentified U.S. officials: Officials in China, Israel, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates have discussed how to manipulate him by taking advantage of his business dealings and complicated finances. Speaking of the Kushner business: It’s is in talks to buy Vornado out of 666 Fifth Ave., the troubled Manhattan skyscraper that the two own, according to the WSJ. Critics will ask, where would the money come from? Is it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no. CNBC reports Snap’s download rates have remained strong, according to App Annie. And Snap’s shares are up 5 percent. Background Snap’s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock. The criticism has also overshadowed Snap’s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent. BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock’s annual report: The filing goes on to say: That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years. What to make of Wall Street’s response to Mr. Powell? One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy. To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes. Is it working?  Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year. Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell’s testimony. — Peter Eavis • Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has floated the idea of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, more than a year after President Trump walked away.

5a969b83410cf7000162e69c,2018-02-28T12:07:27+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/walmart-and-dicks-major-gun-retailers-will-tighten-rules-on-guns-they-sell.html,Business,"Two of the nation’s leading gun sellers, Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, took steps on Wednesday to limit their sales of firearms, thrusting themselves into the middle of the polarizing national debate over gun control. Walmart, the biggest gun seller, announced late in the afternoon that it would not sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age. It also said it would no longer sell items resembling assault-style rifles, including toys and air guns. Early in the day, Dick’s said it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores. The retailer also said that it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and would also require any gun buyer to be at least 21, regardless of local laws. Under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles and other firearms. The dual announcements, made two weeks after 17 students and staff members were killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., were among the most significant actions taken on guns by corporate America. Both retailers said their decision were a response to the shooting. Earlier, President Trump met at the White House with a bipartisan group of lawmakers and called for a series of gun control measures, some of which the National Rifle Association has vigorously opposed. Walmart and Dick’s acted after a number of major companies moved last week to dissociate themselves from the N.R.A. Hertz car rental, MetLife insurance and Delta Air Lines, among others, publicly ended their relationships with the organization. In a news release late Wednesday, Walmart noted that in 2015 it discontinued the sale of  high-powered rifles, including AR-15-style weapons, in its stores in the United States. But at the time, Walmart sidestepped any controversy involving gun politics, attributing its decision to lower customer demand for the military-style rifles. This time, Walmart directly linked its action to the shooting in Florida, saying, “In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales.” Top Walmart executives made the decision and then informed the board, a company spokesman said. Walmart sells guns in roughly half of its nearly 4,000 supercenters, the company said, but the sheer scale of its customer base gives its decision significant heft. Every week, more than 150 million people around the country shop at Walmart. Dick’s decision was announced by Edward Stack, the 63-year-old chief executive whose father founded the store in 1948. Mr. Stack made clear that he was deliberately steering his company directly into the storm over gun reform. “When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset,” Mr. Stack said in an interview. “We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘Enough is enough.’ It got to us.” He added, “We’re going to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.” The decision drew immediate — and passionate — reaction on social media. By midday, the number of Twitter messages containing Dick’s name had jumped 12,000 percent from the average over the previous 10 days, according to Sprout Social, a social media management, advocacy and analytics software platform. About 79 percent of the tweets had a positive sentiment, Sprout Social said, including supportive messages from Hollywood actors and actresses. But the company’s critics posted their plans to no longer shop at the retailer, some closing their tweets with “#boycott.” Investors did not appear to worry about a backlash, as Dick’s stock spent much of Wednesday trading about 1.8 percent higher before finishing up 0.69 percent. Mr. Stack said Dick’s hoped to move the conversation beyond social media and into the political realm. As part of its stance, the company is calling on elected officials to pass what it called “common sense gun reform”: raising the minimum age to buy guns to 21, banning assault-type weapons and so-called bump stocks, and conducting broader background checks that include mental-health information and previous interactions with law enforcement. This is not the first time that Dick’s has made changes in response to a school massacre. In 2012, after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Dick’s removed assault-style rifles from its main stores. But a few months later, the company began carrying the firearms at its outdoor and hunting retail chain, Field & Stream. As of Wednesday morning, the company said, AR-15-style and other semiautomatic rifles will no longer be sold in its 35 Field & Stream stores or on its websites. And this time, Mr. Stack added, the changes will be permanent. Mr. Stack said the retailer had begun scouring its purchase records shortly after the identity of the suspected Parkland killer, Nikolas Cruz, became known. The company soon discovered that it had legally sold a gun to Mr. Cruz in November, though it was not the type used in the school shooting. “But it came to us that we could have been a part of this story,” Mr. Stack said. “We said, ‘We don’t want to be a part of this any longer.’” That response raised rounds of discussions with the company’s top executives and its directors, all of whom backed the decision to take a stand, Mr. Stack said. He said Dick’s remained a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and would continue to sell a variety of sport and hunting firearms. Although he has never been a member of the N.R.A., Mr. Stack said, he is a gun owner and enjoys trapshooting. But when it comes to selling guns to individuals under 21 or stocking assault-style rifles, Mr. Stack said, his company is done. “We don’t want to be a part of a mass shooting,” he said. The company said that it had not decided what to do with ts inventory of assault-style rifles but that they would not be sold in the marketplace. Legal experts said they saw no likely challenges to Dick’s decision to stop selling assault-style rifles. But the decision to stop selling weapons to anyone under 21, however, could be tested in court. Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the School of Law of the University of California, Los Angeles, said Dick’s could be challenged in lawsuits claiming a violation of laws that bar age discrimination. Although federal civil rights laws do not apply, some states, including New York, prohibit businesses from denying goods and services on the basis of age. “Don’t be surprised if an aggressive attorney general of a gun-friendly state brings an age-discrimination claim against Dick’s,” Professor Winkler wrote in an email response to questions. The company said that it believed its decision was in accordance with the law and that it was instituting the policy immediately.",6827
5a9689c6410cf7000162e665,2018-02-28T10:51:46+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/germany-daimler-china-geely.html,Business,"Germany said on Wednesday that it would investigate tightening the rules that govern when an investor needed to disclose a holding in a company after China’s Geely purchased a $9 billion stake in Daimler, surprising the market. Geely’s founder and main owner, Li Shufu, revealed on Friday that he had built up a 9.7 percent stake in Daimler, the owner of the Mercedes-Benz brand, without having previously disclosed that he had crossed regulatory thresholds of 3 percent and 5 percent. The stake purchase has rekindled fears in Germany that its highly prized expertise could fall into Chinese hands. An Economy Ministry report to the economics committee of the Bundestag, Germany’s Parliament, said on Wednesday, “Against the backdrop of the current case, the federal government will examine whether the existing rules are sufficient to provide an adequate level of transparency, or if further guidelines are necessary,” according to Reuters. Any decisions would be made by the new German coalition government. Geely worked with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which declined to comment, to help secure a 9.69 percent voting stake using derivatives to help skirt disclosure requirements. The economy minister, Brigitte Zypries, stuck to Berlin’s position that Geely’s move was a business matter, but said Germany’s openness must not be exploited by other countries. Geely, which owns rival Swedish carmaker Volvo, is pushing Daimler for access to know-how in electric and autonomous cars. On Wednesday, a German parliamentary committee was to question government officials on whether Geely has violated disclosure rules and whether loopholes in securities trading law need to be closed, the Stuttgarter Zeitung and Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspapers reported on Tuesday. The Chinese carmaker first approached Daimler in November and asked it to issue shares so that it could buy a stake, as well as for access to battery technology to help set up an electric car joint venture in Wuhan, China. Daimler, which employs 289,000 people, declined to do a deal, since it had reservations about a new industrial alliance for fear of alienating its existing Chinese joint venture partner, BAIC, according to Reuters. Germany tightened its rules on foreign takeovers last year, the first European Union country to do so, after a series of deals saw China gain access to high-tech know-how, while attempts by German companies to buy full control of Chinese rivals remain prohibited. The country also tightened disclosure policies to prevent “sneak attacks” from succeeding after the car manufacturer Porsche in 2008 accumulated a stake of about 30 percent in Volkswagen while keeping investors in the dark. Porsche used “cash-settled options” to buy the stake by stealth, officials said. The buyer of regular stock options gets the right to buy or sell stock at a certain price by a certain date. But in cash-settled options, the buyer gets the right not to stock itself but to the cash difference between the options’ “strike price” and the market price of the shares when the options are exercised. The German auto-parts supplier Schaeffler did something similar, secretly cornering about one-third of the shares of its larger rival Continental. Some investors complained that Porsche and Schaeffler had crossed the boundaries of fair play, taking advantage of disclosure rules that were too loose and regulators that were too tentative. “Hidden ownership to try to avoid disclosure of large stakes, if successful, creates a uneven playing field,” said Henry Hu, the Allan Shivers chair in the law of banking and finance at the University of Texas at Austin. “It would undermine the interests of investors and target companies, and be inconsistent with the core values of transparency,” he said.",3786
5a9637ab410cf7000162e588,2018-02-28T05:01:24+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/pedestrian-deaths-marijuana.html,Business,"Pedestrian deaths in traffic accidents have reached levels not seen in years, and a safety group has sought to explain why. It has identified several possible causes, like digital distractions and an increase in driving. Now it has added another: marijuana. Over the first six months of 2017, pedestrian fatalities rose sharply from a year earlier in states that had legalized recreational marijuana, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association. In the rest of the country, such deaths declined. “We are not making a definitive, cause-and-effect link to marijuana,” said Richard Retting, a traffic safety engineer at Sam Schwartz Consulting who was the author of the study. The data “is a marker for concern,” he added. “It may be a canary in a coal mine, an early indicator to address.” Pedestrian deaths are far higher than a decade ago, both in sheer numbers and as a share of traffic fatalities. In 2016, the last full year for which the safety association has data, nearly 6,000 pedestrians were killed, 16 percent of the overall traffic toll. Many factors can cause traffic deaths to rise, and safety experts say the increases in recent years are partly a byproduct of recovery from the recession. “People are driving more when the economy is growing,” Mr. Retting said. Populations are rising in urban areas where most pedestrian fatalities occur, and cities are more congested. But this year, the group also called attention to the numbers for states that legalized recreational marijuana between 2012 and 2016 — Alaska, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington — as well as the District of Columbia, which did likewise. In Alaska and Maine, pedestrian deaths are so few that any changes may not be statistically sufficient to identify a clear connection to the drug. Even in Colorado, a 12 percent jump in pedestrian deaths meant the total rose to 37 in the first half of last year, from 33 in 2016. Massachusetts was the only state in the group where such deaths decreased — by one. “I’d be cautious about drawing a direct link to any potential cause,” said Jason Levine, executive director at the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C. “But it’s certainly worth trying to figure out why those numbers are what they are.” Among the unanswered questions is whether and to what extent any link reflects marijuana use by drivers, pedestrians or both. Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said his organization had not studied links between marijuana use and severe crashes that involve deaths. But he said insurance claims from all collisions, including fender benders, were about 3 percent higher in states that have legalized marijuana than in nearby states. Mr. Retting said the data he had examined suggested that increasing smartphone use might also be contributing to the rise in pedestrian fatalities. In 2015 and 2016, the total rose roughly 10 percent each year. “It’s never increased that much, going all the way back to the 1970s,” he said. The number of miles driven and the number of walking trips that people take have increased, but not enough to account for a 10 percent jump in pedestrian deaths, Mr. Retting said. At the same time, the number of smartphones in use more than tripled from 2010 to 2016, he said. “What this tells me is that here is a metric worth keeping an eye on,” he said. The governors’ association, which refers to itself as “the states’ voice on highway safety,” found that five states — California, Texas, Florida, New York and Arizona — accounted for 43 percent of all pedestrian traffic deaths. The states with the most pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 people were Arizona, New Mexico, Delaware, Louisiana and Florida. While the overall number of pedestrian deaths in the first six months of 2017 was lower than in the 2016 period, the group said it projected that the rate for all of 2017 would be “essentially unchanged” from the year before.",3983
5a96184b410cf7000162e559,2018-02-28T02:47:25+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/steve-wynn-rape-accusastion.html,Business,"A woman told the police that she had a child with the casino mogul Steve Wynn after he raped her, while another reported that she was forced to resign from a Las Vegas job after she refused to have sex with him. The Associated Press on Tuesday obtained copies of police reports recently filed by the two women about allegations dating to the 1970s. The police in Las Vegas said this month that they had taken the statements after a news report in January revealed sexual misconduct allegations against the billionaire. The allegations are the latest leveled against Mr. Wynn. He resigned as chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts on Feb. 6, less than two weeks after The Wall Street Journal reported in an in-depth investigation that a number of women said he harassed or assaulted them and that one case led to a $7.5 million settlement. Mr. Wynn has vehemently denied the misconduct accusations the newspaper reported, and he attributed them to a campaign led by his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, whose lawyer has denied that she instigated the news article. The fallout for Mr. Wynn and his empire has been swift since the first allegations were disclosed. He  resigned as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, and his name was stripped from buildings and programs at various universities. In one police report obtained by The A.P., a woman told police officers that Mr. Wynn raped her at least three times around 1973 and 1974 at her Chicago apartment. She reported that she became pregnant and gave birth to a girl in a gas station restroom. In one instance, the woman claimed that Mr. Wynn pinned her against the refrigerator and raped her. She said he then made a phone call, kissed her on the cheek and left. The report does not explain how Mr. Wynn would have entered the apartment or whether they had known each other. The woman said she did not give him a key. In the second police report, a woman told the police that she had consensual sex with Mr. Wynn “several times” while she worked as a dealer at a downtown Las Vegas casino-hotel called the Golden Nugget, but “felt coerced to perform the acts.” She reported that she was forced to resign when she turned him down. The women’s names are redacted on the reports, and the police said they did not identify people who said they were victims of sex crimes. The Las Vegas case will not be investigated because the statute of limitations in Nevada is 20 years. Ralph Frammolino, a spokesman for Mr. Wynn, on Tuesday declined to comment on the latest allegations. Wynn Resorts is also facing scrutiny by gambling regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts, where the company is building a $2.4 billion casino outside Boston. Regulators in Macau, the Chinese enclave where the company operates two casinos, are also inquiring about the allegations. In addition, groups of shareholders have filed lawsuits in state court in Las Vegas accusing Mr. Wynn and the board of Wynn Resorts of breaching their fiduciary duties by ignoring what the lawsuits described as a longstanding pattern of sexual abuse and harassment by the company’s founder.",3111
5a960d32410cf7000162e544,2018-02-28T02:00:13+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/technology/flying-taxis.html,Business,"SAN FRANCISCO — Flying cars are just starting to inch their way out of science fiction. But that is not stopping some companies from planning for flying taxi services. A growing collection of tech companies, aircraft manufacturers, automakers and investors are betting that fleets of battery-powered aircraft will give rise to air taxi services, perhaps as soon as the next decade. Some of those taxis, the companies hope, may even use artificial intelligence to fly themselves. The deal making, technology exploration and perhaps wishful thinking around this new sort of flying transportation — please, the companies ask, don’t call them flying cars — are reminiscent of the work done on self-driving cars just a few years ago. No one can say for certain if these new vehicles will turn out to be a real business. But many companies are already worried about being left behind. The European aerospace company Airbus said Tuesday that it was making an investment in Blade, an aviation start-up in New York, and forming a partnership to expand Blade’s helicopter hailing service in more cities around the world. Last week, Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, said he expected the ride-hailing company to start flying passengers on a service called Uber Air in five to 10 years. In November, Boeing acquired Aurora Flight Sciences, a company specializing in flight systems for pilotless aircraft, for an undisclosed sum. Before the acquisition, Aurora had been working with Uber to develop a flying taxi. And Joby Aviation, a start-up in Santa Cruz, Calif., building its own air taxi, said this month that it had raised $100 million in venture funding from a consortium of investors including the venture capital arms of Intel, Toyota Motor and JetBlue Airways. “This is the natural progression of the vehicles we make,” said Ben Bridge, head of global business for Airbus Helicopters. “We want a seat at the table and a voice in the conversation that is happening.” Flying cars even played a bit role in the recently settled legal fight over trade secrets between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car service spun out of Google. In court testimony this month, Travis Kalanick, Uber’s former chief executive, said he had heard that Larry Page — the chief executive of Waymo’s parent company, Alphabet, who has a side project building new types of aircraft — was upset because Uber was “doing their thing” with flying cars. Whatever you imagine a flying car to be — stop. What these companies envision is something like a helicopter but much quieter and more affordable. Think of a hobbyist’s drone, but big enough to fit people. It would, in theory, be welcome in urban environments and affordable to more than well-heeled businesspeople. At least, that’s the dream. Before there can be too much enthusiasm for these flying taxi services, it’s worth noting that self-driving cars have yet to turn into a notable business for anyone, despite about a decade of research at tech giants like Google and billions in investment from Silicon Valley and the auto industry. Regulators are just starting to agree on rules for large-scale tests of self-driving cars on public roads. How would they deal with flying taxis? The details of the future service are far — very far — from being ironed out. Still, there are some reasons for the new enthusiasm. Battery improvements and the wide use of drones have spawned technological breakthroughs. The taxis would take off and land vertically like a helicopter, so they’d take up less room. Because they would be battery-powered, they would be more environmentally friendly. For now, Airbus executives hope to gain from Blade’s experience with an app that allows customers to reserve a seat on a helicopter. Airbus is expected to invest up to $15 million in Blade, which would represent about a 10 percent stake in the company, according to a person who is familiar with the transaction but not permitted to discuss the investment details publicly. Both companies see helicopters as an intermediate step until a new type of aircraft and taxi service hits the market. Rob Wiesenthal, Blade’s chief executive, said a quieter and less expensive alternative to helicopters “opens up a whole new world.” Airbus said it was preparing for a test flight by year-end for its CityAirbus aircraft, which carries up to four passengers and can reach a cruising speed of about 75 miles per hour. It plans to deploy the CityAirbus in 2023. Uber has said it expects to begin testing of its urban air taxis in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Los Angeles and Dubai in 2020. The company has landed exclusive deals for vertical takeoff and landing spots with real estate companies, including in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Uber declared its interest with its Uber Elevate initiative in 2016, forecasting a future when it could offer 15-minute Uber Air rides from San Francisco to San Jose for $20. The 50-mile ride with Uber Pool, its car-pooling option, usually takes about two hours in rush-hour traffic and costs $83. It did not put a date on that future. In a concept video for Uber Elevate, a woman opens the Uber app, which gives her a choice of taking a ride with Uber Pool, UberX or Uber Air. She enters a nearby building and rides the elevator to the top floor, where she boards an air taxi in Uber Skyport. Uber is also establishing performance guidelines for its flying taxis, including asking that the new aircraft make only one-quarter of the noise of a small four-seat helicopter. Uber also has supplier deals in place with five manufacturers, including Textron’s Bell Helicopter. “We believe the best way to get this idea off the ground is to partner with world-class companies and stakeholders that have a diverse set of specializations,” an Uber spokesman, Matt Wing, said in a statement. Daniel Wiegand, a co-founder and the chief executive of the German air taxi company Lilium, said investors considered him totally crazy when he pitched the company in 2015. “It has completely changed,” Mr. Wiegand said. Like many of his competitors, he dismisses the phrase “flying cars” because other companies are working on cars that fly as well as drive on the road. In September, Lilium announced that it had raised $90 million from investors, including the Chinese internet giant Tencent. And then there is Google — or, to be more specific, Mr. Page, Google’s co-founder and Alphabet’s chief executive. He has invested part of his personal wealth in Kitty Hawk, a start-up that has demonstrated a personal aircraft that flies using propellers over water. A Kitty Hawk division called Zee Aero is also reportedly working on an air taxi concept aircraft. Mr. Kalanick said he told Mr. Page that he believed a flying service “sounds pretty cool,” even though Uber wasn’t building one. But once the aircraft are available, he said, “I will make sure that our 50 million or so customers at the time can push a button and get a flying car.”",6962
5a960618410cf7000162e53e,2018-02-28T01:29:55+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/nra-delta-gun-control.html,Business,"ATLANTA — Delta Air Lines, one of Georgia’s largest private-sector employers, is among the glossiest corporate jewels in the state, contributing billions of dollars a year to the economy. Its hundreds of daily flights in and out of Atlanta’s airport are the main reason Georgia’s capital can brag, with justification, that it is a truly international city. “Delta is the Atlanta international airport, and our airport is, you know, the fuel that generates our commercial community,” said Sam Massell, the city’s former mayor. But prestige, boosterism and corporate coddling — all cherished concepts in Georgia — took a back seat this week to the national debate over gun control. In the wake of the Florida school shooting, the airline announced it was ending a promotional discount with the National Rifle Association, and suddenly found itself in the rare position of being openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans who control the statehouse. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, a Republican who presides over the State Senate and has received an A-plus grade from the N.R.A., joined other conservative lawmakers this week in threatening to remove a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel that some hoped would encourage Delta to open even more routes — and help Atlanta attract even more national and international companies. The conservative backlash highlighted the challenge confronting corporations around the country that are struggling to cater to both ends of America’s increasingly distant political and cultural poles. As pressure from social media and advocacy groups has intensified, and calls for boycotts mount, more than a dozen companies have severed business ties with the N.R.A. since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Just as quickly, a counteroffensive arose from gun supporters excoriating the companies for their stance, forcing business leaders to navigate the treacherous ground where social responsibility, ideology and financial impact converge. Delta did not respond on Tuesday to Mr. Cagle’s threat or amplify its stance regarding the N.R.A. In a statement over the weekend, the company said its decision to stop offering discounted fares to the N.R.A. “reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.” As of Tuesday afternoon, the jet-fuel tax break, while opposed by Mr. Cagle and some other conservative Republicans, had not yet been stripped out of a broader Senate tax bill. Delta chose to end special discounts, but FedEx took a different approach, one that highlighted the delicate balancing act. In a statement Monday, FedEx said it disagreed with the N.R.A.’s stance on civilian access to assault rifles but would continue to offer discounts of up to 26 percent to the group’s members. “We are very clear that, when we set pricing strategy or look to adjust pricing, it is not based on political positions or points of view,” Patrick Fitzgerald, the company’s senior vice president, integrated marketing and communications, said in an interview on Tuesday. “But we do have a very clear corporate position in terms of gun safety and school safety.” In Georgia, the debate has been surprisingly fiery, even in a state long defined by tensions between the liberal metropolis and conservative countryside, and between the values of global corporate culture and those of Southern Republicans. “Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Mr. Cagle, a leading G.O.P. candidate for governor, wrote in a tweet Monday, in which he announced that he would “kill any tax legislation” that benefited Delta unless it changed its position. State Senator Josh McKoon said in an interview Tuesday that he was put off by Delta’s assertion that it was trying to remain neutral on the guns issue, when it had taken positions on other social topics in the past. “It just came off as very disingenuous,” Mr. McKoon said of Delta’s statement. Referring to Mr. Cagle’s pushback, Mr. McKoon said, “I think he captured the sentiment and the feeling of a lot of Georgians,” who, he said, were frustrated “with Delta weighing in on an issue that has nothing to do with the topic of transportation, for sure.” But Mr. Massell, the former mayor who is president of the Buckhead Coalition, an influential Atlanta business and civic group, called the entire debate “embarrassing.” He said that he feared the threat against Delta would scare away Amazon, the online retail giant that has listed Atlanta among the finalists for its second headquarters. “I don’t believe in blackmail, and I’m sorry to use such a dirty word, but that’s almost what it tastes like,” said Mr. Massell, a Democrat who served as mayor from 1970 to 1974. “That’s terrible. That’s not Georgia’s image. That’s backwoods stuff that doesn’t belong at all.” The story of Delta and the story of Atlanta have been deeply intertwined for decades. The company was founded in Louisiana in the 1920s; it focused, in the earliest days, on crop dusting, in an effort to end the boll weevil infestation that had ruined many Southern cotton crops. The company moved to Atlanta in 1941. In subsequent decades, the city, which was founded as a railroad hub, invested heavily in its airport, and pushed a message that it was more socially tolerant than other Southern cities like Birmingham. It was a winning combination. Today, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest in the world, and Delta employs more than 33,000 Georgia residents. Its current problem with the legislature has prompted leaders in other states to woo Delta via Twitter. “You know, in mathematics, Delta represents the change in something,” wrote Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham. He added, “Let’s chat.” Michael Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business and faculty director of the Center for Social Impact, said in an interview that “Delta has every right to tell legislators, ‘We’re not of a mind to do your bidding.’ They could easily pack their bags and move away from Atlanta and go to Dallas.” But it seemed unlikely that the airline would move. In 2016, the company signed an airport lease with the city that would keep its headquarters in Atlanta through 2036. “Atlanta and Georgia and the business community usually try to work together and Delta is a huge employer in this state,” said another former Atlanta mayor, Shirley Franklin. “So the relationship is damaged, if nothing else.” A broader concern, shared by some liberals, conservatives and members of the Georgia business community, is that gun control may now join other hot-button cultural topics that may damage the state’s reputation among national and global corporations that do not adhere to the same conservative Southern values as the state legislature. In the last few years, the legislature has taken up a number of prominent bills that critics say would allow for discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed one of them, a so-called religious liberty bill, in 2016, after some of the state’s most prestigious and powerful companies — including Delta, Home Depot and Coca-Cola — openly opposed the measure. Mr. Deal, a Republican, will soon leave office because of term limits. Mr. Cagle, a leading candidate to replace him, is among a number of Republican hopefuls who say they will continue to support the legislation, which would have strengthened legal protection for opponents of same-sex marriage. Mr. McKoon, a Republican who is leaving the upper chamber to run for secretary of state, said that he had long opposed the jet-fuel tax break on the grounds that it seemed like a handout for a politically connected industry. Mr. McKoon was a vocal supporter of the 2016 religious liberty bill that Mr. Deal vetoed. He said that when that legislation failed, he issued a warning, saying that liberals would continue pressuring companies to embrace progressive social positions. He warned, he said, that “the next logical step would be to attack gun rights. And I think we are seeing the beginning of that.”",8160
5a95f66a410cf7000162e518,2018-02-28T00:23:01+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/sinclair-tribune-merger-antitrust.html,Business,"WASHINGTON — When Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intent to buy Tribune Media in a blockbuster merger last May, the company predicted that regulators would quickly wave through the deal. But 10 months later, Sinclair remains locked in a prolonged battle with Justice Department antitrust officials over how many stations it must sell to get their approval. It is latest cloud over Sinclair’s $3.9 billion deal, coinciding with an internal investigation underway at the Federal Communications Commission into the agency’s relationship with the company. At issue is how much power Sinclair, the country’s largest broadcaster, will have over local media markets and national television audiences. Sinclair has argued that by combining forces with Tribune, it will be able to bolster local news coverage and be a stronger competitor to internet giants like Facebook and Google. The Justice Department is concerned that the merger will harm competition in several cities. The agency is looking at whether the deal could also give Sinclair too much power over television advertising and over licensing deals with cable and satellite companies that retransmit their broadcasts. John Newman, a professor at the University of Memphis and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department, said previous big radio mergers — similar in many ways to the Sinclair-Tribune deal — had been approved by the Justice Department without a lot of focus on how consumers were harmed. The treatment of the Sinclair deal, he said, shows that “the D.O.J. is getting more aggressive and looking at consumer welfare, too.” The Justice Department and Sinclair declined to comment. The two sides are expected to come to an agreement eventually, according to three people familiar with the negotiations who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. But the Justice Department’s demands for more divestitures has added another layer of complexity to a deal that, from the moment it was announced, faced broad opposition from Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups. Opponents have argued that the deal would curtail the number of unique voices in media, reduce coverage of local news and decrease competition. The F.C.C. is reviewing the merger separately from the Justice Department, focusing on whether the deal is in the public’s interest. The agency is widely expected to approve the deal. Last week, in an attempt to move closer to a resolution, Sinclair submitted a proposal to sell stations in big markets including New York and Chicago, as well as some smaller stations. The proposal would put many of the stations in trusts, an arrangement that has raised some concern from consumer groups that the company will try to operate them through partners down the road, because it runs some stations that way now. The Tribune stations in New York and Chicago would not go into a trust, but Sinclair said it had reached agreements to sell those stations to third parties that it would partner with later. Selling them will help Sinclair get near an important threshold: owning stations that reach no more than than 39 percent of American households, the limit under F.C.C. rules. The F.C.C. review could hit another roadblock. The agency’s inspector general is looking into whether the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, improperly coordinated with Sinclair on regulatory decisions that enabled the merger. The inspector general’s office says its policy is to not comment on the existence or the nonexistence of an investigation. In addition, Sinclair’s new plan has not satisfied the Justice Department, which still seeks more divestitures, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation. The government’s demands are an unexpected setback for Sinclair, which predicted its proposal would be met by more sympathy from regulators in the Trump administration. Sinclair’s initial confidence was partly buoyed by a string of regulatory victories last year at the F.C.C., including the relaxation of a television ownership limit last April that enabled its $3.9 billion merger with Tribune. Analysts had expected more corporate consolidation under President Trump, but the Justice Department’s response to Sinclair’s proposed deal for Tribune instead underscores a surprising skepticism toward big corporate mergers, particularly those involving the media industry. In November, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T’s $85 billion bid for Time Warner because of concern that the union of telecom and media giants would have too much power over streaming video entertainment. “Clearly, the D.O.J. has honed in on the dangers of concentrated transmission and concentrated media content markets that is harmful to competition and to consumers,” said Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge and a former senior antitrust official the Justice Department. The biggest sticking point for Sinclair appears to be how many stations it would need to sell in order to get its deal approved. In its new proposal, Sinclair asked that it be able to keep multiple stations in greater Greensboro, N.C., greater Harrisburg, Pa., and Indianapolis. The company said it should be able to have two of the top four stations in the local markets after the F.C.C.’s action last November to relaxed rules barring too much concentration among top stations. Sinclair’s filing of an amended plan last week could indicate that the company believes it is close to a resolution with the Justice Department and that it is confident enough to start the process moving again at the F.C.C. The list of divestitures Sinclair proposed in its amended plan could still change, Marci Ryvicker, a senior analyst with Wells Fargo, said. “We do not believe that this is the final list of the station divestitures,” Ms. Ryvicker wrote in a research note last week.",5886
5a95f403410cf7000162e510,2018-02-28T00:12:46+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/online-sex-trafficking-bill.html,Business,"The House on Tuesday passed a bill that gives victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking, adding a new level of accountability for internet companies. Silicon Valley had strongly opposed the bill, because it would chip away at an existing law that gives internet companies broad immunity for the content that people put on their services. Tech companies that argued against the bill said that the current law has encouraged free speech online and helped the internet thrive. But sex trafficking victims and law enforcement officials say the existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has been too loosely applied by sites like Backpage.com, a site known for prostitution and sex trafficking. Some large online companies, including Facebook, eventually backed off from their opposition to the bill after its scope was narrowed. “Congress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,” said Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who introduced the bill, known as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. “This is not a slippery slope. It is a narrow amendment to stop crimes by businesses online that they weren’t able to commit offline.” A similar bill in the Senate was expected to pass soon. The new legislation would not affect most internet companies. A victim would need to prove a site had knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to successfully sue the company. But not all online companies could hide behind the Section 230 shield. The bill’s passage in the House signaled an important turning point for an industry that has largely operated free of regulations. Pressure has been mounting for social media companies and other internet giants to be better stewards of their powerful platforms. Facebook, in particular, has come under pressure over the spread of misinformation and the exertion of foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for regulations, including disclosures on political advertising, but those efforts have been slow to gain wide support. “Clearly the environment has changed a lot for big internet companies over the past year,” said Paul Gallant, a tech and telecom industry analyst at Cowen & Co. “But I still don’t think there is a willingness for the government to pursue fundamental business model changes.” Facebook began to change its position on the bill last fall, before congressional hearings on sex-trafficking bills and an intelligence committee hearing on Russian influence on social networks. “We all have a responsibility to do our part to fight this,” Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote in a post on the site this week. “We at Facebook support efforts to pass amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving victims the chance to seek justice against companies that knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.” Some large tech companies, including Oracle, IBM and HP, have supported the new legislative effort all along. But many start-ups, including those represented by Engine Advocacy, a trade group, remained opposed to the bills. Engine Advocacy said part of the bill would hurt start-ups that lean heavily on user-generated content, and could lead Congress to take more actions to weaken the openness of the internet.",3431
5a95d1d6410cf7000162e4ad,2018-02-27T21:46:58+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/dealbook/amazon-buys-ring.html,Business,"Amazon said Tuesday that it had acquired Ring, a maker of internet-connected doorbells and cameras, pushing more deeply into the home security market. The deal is worth around $1.1 billion, according to a person briefed on the deal who would speak only anonymously because the terms were private. Ring is best known for a doorbell with a security camera inside. The device allows homeowners to monitor visitors at their front door through an app on their phone, even if they’re not at home. Amazon has made home automation a major focus because of the success of its Echo family of products, which allow users to control thermostats, surveillance cameras and other connected devices using voice commands. Amazon’s Echo Spot device already works with Ring doorbells, allowing people to look at footage from the cameras on the Echo Spot’s screen. Amazon had invested an undisclosed amount in Ring through its Alexa Fund, which finances start-ups that integrate their products with Alexa, the Amazon intelligent assistant that powers Echoes and other devices. Buying Ring, though, suggests that Amazon has more ambitious plans for the product than it could achieve through a partnership. Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, a start-up that makes a family of smart locks, said he believed that Amazon would make a more serious effort to enter the home security market and compete against companies like ADT, Comcast and Alarm.com. Mr. Schoenfelder speculated that Amazon could seek to make home security part of its Prime membership service, which today includes free and fast delivery of orders and video streaming. “You could imagine some kind of bundled offering with Ring’s capabilities,” he said. ADT’s stock fell sharply after the deal became public on Tuesday afternoon. It ended the day down 4.6 percent. The companies declined to say much about their plans. “Ring’s home security products and services have delighted customers since Day 1,” Amazon said in a statement. “We’re excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure.” Ring’s statement said: “We’ll be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive, customer-centric company like Amazon. We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.” Ring’s internet doorbells start at $179. People who want to use them to record video must pay for that capability, with plans starting at $3 a month or $30 a year. The company also makes stand-alone security cameras. Amazon has taken some baby steps into home security. Last year it began selling an indoor security camera of its own design, Amazon Cloud Cam, and in December it acquired Blink, a maker of inexpensive internet security cameras and doorbells. A service called Amazon Key uses cameras and internet-connected door locks to allow delivery people to drop orders inside customers’ homes. Google, one of Amazon’s biggest rivals, is also an increasingly important player in home automation and security, with its Nest thermostats and security cameras. James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said he believed that Amazon had bought Ring so it could add more intelligent capabilities to its doorbells and cameras, like the ability to use software to recognize faces at the front door. “I think it’s about going to the next level and having Alexa say, ‘James, your fifth grader just walked in, and I locked the door behind them,’” he said. “It’s where these technologies have to go.”",3529
5a95cf9f410cf7000162e4a4,2018-02-27T21:37:29+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/nra-boycotts.html,Business,"Judith Pearson’s home in rural Minnesota is stocked with guns for hunting and recreational use, but that didn’t stop her from venting her frustration with the National Rifle Association after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Ms. Pearson, a retired school principal, was irked by the group’s repeated efforts to preserve civilian access to semiautomatic rifles, like the AR-15 the gunman used to kill 17 students and school staff members. “BoycottNRA,” she wrote to her handful of Twitter followers on the day of the attack, becoming one of the first participants in what became a sprawling campaign to force corporate America to dissociate itself from the gun lobby. Across the country, in Los Angeles, Laura Mannino had a similar thought. Drain the NRA, an advocacy group she co-founded in October after a deadly shooting in Las Vegas, developed a public spreadsheet of businesses associated with the gun group. After the attack in Florida, Ms. Mannino helped organize a rally against gun violence in downtown Los Angeles that drew hundreds of people. “Everyone started, in parallel ways, but in tandem, to go after these companies,” she said. Since the Parkland massacre, a range of people and coalitions have converged on the nationwide battleground over gun control. That includes individuals trying to make a statement, activist organizations sensing a shift in sentiment, informal parents’ clubs, marketing executives, niche media groups, celebrities and shooting survivors. Through an uncoordinated but simpatico collection of Twitter hashtags, retweeted lists, Facebook groups, online petitions and carefully orchestrated campaigns, the protest has pushed a major bank, several car rental companies, two airlines and other businesses to publicly cut ties with the N.R.A. On Monday night, the insurance broker Lockton Affinity was the latest to join a list of more than a dozen companies that includes the insurance provider MetLife, the cybersecurity firm Symantec, and the automobile pricing and information website TrueCar. Unlike hundreds of other boycotts that barely registered with consumers, the current effort has “taken on significant symbolic purpose” and speed, said Lawrence B. Glickman, a history professor and boycotts expert at Cornell University. “This wasn’t a concerted thing — it just took off and took on a life of its own,” Professor Glickman said. “It’s stunning — nothing like this has ever happened before with the N.R.A. as far as I know.” The #BoycottNRA hashtag, the unofficial unifier of the movement, was trending on Twitter on Friday and appeared more than 10,000 times in a single four-hour period on Monday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. The hashtag has floated around social media since before the Sandy Hook massacre in late 2012, usually bubbling up after high-profile mass shootings only to quickly fade after failing to inspire much action. After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14, two dozen tweets mentioned the hashtag, followed by three dozen more the next day. But the calls for a boycott remained vague until last week, when lists of companies linked to the N.R.A. began tearing across social media. Posts from popular accounts were retweeted thousands of times. ThinkProgress, a news website with a liberal bent, was among the first to spread the names, updating a list on Feb. 20 that it first published after the Sandy Hook shooting. It also published a report that the website for the N.R.A.’s official credit card was down. On Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which issued the credit card, publicly confirmed its break from the N.R.A. “Then the floodgates were open,” said Judd Legum, who founded ThinkProgress. “Lots of people began moving very, very fast.” The pressure on companies to cut ties with the N.R.A. soon began sprouting up from various sources. Students who survived the Parkland shooting, who have become vocal proponents of gun control — and some of whom now have hundreds of thousands of social media followers — began pressuring specific companies to follow the bank’s lead. The massive asset manager BlackRock demanded information about the gun industry’s presence in investment portfolios. There were also calls for banks and payment processing companies to refuse firearms-related transactions. Facebook posts and petitions from parents in Brooklyn, hiking enthusiasts and bike shops urged consumers and retailers like REI not to support CamelBak hydration packs and Bell helmets. Those brands are owned by Vista Outdoor, which also makes guns and ammunition. Celebrities including Alyssa Milano and Denis O’Hare began backing a push to stop Amazon and other streaming sites from supporting the NRATV online video channel. Unaware of the Hollywood campaign, Brad Chase, a communications consultant who in the past has worked with some of the brands that distanced themselves from the N.R.A., staged his own protest against Amazon after seeing screen grabs of the N.R.A.’s content streaming on its platforms. He and a longtime friend, whose son survived the Parkland shooting, initiated a petition on Thursday that asked people to “flood Amazon’s Legal Department with calls.” The pair hoped for 5,000 signatures. By Tuesday afternoon, they had more than 200,000. “We know we’re not going to change this epidemic of gun violence overnight, but this is one of those things people can do right now while we wait for the slow wheels of government to take action,” Mr. Chase said. So far, Amazon has not issued any comment related to the N.R.A. Some companies have resisted calls to sever business relationships with the N.R.A. On Monday, FedEx said that while it disagreed with the N.R.A.’s policies on semiautomatic firearms, it would continue to offer discounts to the group’s members. The N.R.A. itself has accused companies of “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice” and said that “in time, these brands will be replaced by others.” Since that statement on Saturday, the divisive debate has inspired some gun rights supporters to post about joining the N.R.A., using the hashtag #TweetYourNRAMembership. Many N.R.A. supporters have also vowed not to patronize the brands that ended relationships with the gun group. Still, the boycott effort — parts of it organic, parts of it carefully orchestrated — was an impressive show of force against the gun lobby. Shannon Watts, who founded the activist group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America after the Sandy Hook massacre, said her group had successfully persuaded hundreds of companies like Starbucks to block guns in their stores. The organization has more than 100,000 active volunteers it can quickly mobilize to create graphics, send email blasts and fan out over social media. But after Parkland, Moms Demand Action adopted hashtags that others had created and cheered on campaigns that others had organized. “The more the merrier — it’s been a cumulative effort of different groups within the same space, all putting pressure on the N.R.A.,” Ms. Watts said. “What this has shown is that it doesn’t have to be any one specific group or person — it’s more about the overall noise than any single hashtag.”",7237
5a95c980410cf7000162e497,2018-02-27T21:11:23+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/economy/raises-jobs.html,Business,"How low must unemployment go for workers to get a raise? A couple of decades ago, it was normal for workers to get regular pay increases. After declining mercilessly since the early 1970s, the hourly pay of private-sector production and nonsupervisory workers — nurses, cashiers, manufacturing workers on the shop floor and such — hit bottom in 1995 and rose by more than a tenth in real terms over the following eight years. Wages improved up and down the scale as the economy hit full employment. The hourly wage of workers at the bottom tenth of the income distribution rose 11 percent from 1995 to 2000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. It rose almost 8 percent for workers in the middle. Raises are again in the cards. After a long stretch of headlines about stubbornly low wage growth, pay has perked up as the unemployment rate has dipped to levels not seen since the dot-com boom. The median weekly earnings of full-time workers in the middle of the pay ladder ended last year up 4.5 percent from their nadir in the spring of 2014, after accounting for inflation. Target and even Walmart have granted their workers raises. It is high time: Median weekly earnings are only 3 percent higher in real terms than at the millennium. And yet for all the enthusiasm over the economy’s return to full employment, the pay increases of the halcyon 1990s are probably not coming back anytime soon. For one thing, the economic pie is growing more slowly — held in check by lackluster investment, stunted business dynamism and low productivity growth. What’s more, changes in the American economy that stretch back decades — from globalization and automation to the outsourcing of low-paid work and the rise of dominant companies — have deprived workers of leverage. This suggests a double challenge for the nation’s workers. For starters, the American economy needs to recover some of its lost dynamism. For workers to reap a larger share of the spoils of growth, they must claw back the bargaining power they lost. While the goal doesn’t seem impossible, it requires pushing back against a view that has dominated economic policy over the last half century: that government should not stand in the way of corporate America’s forward march, and definitely not mess with its efforts to lower labor costs. On Tuesday, the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution released a series of studies by some of the nation’s top economic thinkers on policies to revitalize wage growth. The good news is that plausible reforms could start tipping the labor market to benefit workers. But bringing the labor market back into balance will require a lot of them. Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggests that to begin with, policymakers could do more to keep labor markets tight. He argues that the Federal Reserve has worried too much about inflation and not enough about the lid it puts on workers’ well-being when it raises interest rates to slow growth. Since 1980, he estimates, the job market has suffered from slack 70 percent of the time — periods when workers, rather than employers, are scrambling. That compares with only a third of the time from 1949 to 1980. To keep it closer to full employment, he proposes a set of policies, including raising the Fed’s inflation target from its current 2 percent, creating a fund to bolster job creation in moments of slack and engaging the government in job creation. And yet, as Mr. Bernstein acknowledges, tight labor markets are only part of the solution. For starters, they eventually end when the cycle turns — and wages can get stuck for a long time. And tight labor markets don’t carry the power they used to. A 1999 study by the economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard University and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University estimated how far the unemployment rate needed to decline to prevent wages from falling. From the mid-1970s to the late ’80s, they found, an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent or lower would keep wages at the bottom tenth of the pay scale from declining. By the 1990s, however, unemployment had to dip to 5.7 percent to prevent wage losses at the bottom. Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute replicated the exercise for the economic expansion that ended with the demise of the housing bubble in 2007: Unemployment, he found, had to fall below 4.6 percent to keep workers in the bottom 10 percent from losing ground. At this pace, unemployment will soon have to hit zero for workers at the bottom to get a raise. So what else can be done? There is obviously a role for training and education to help workers meet employers’ rising demand for skills, especially at the beginning of their career. Fatih Guvenen of the University of Minnesota notes that the income of 25-year-old men starting their careers has declined sharply since the early 1970s and is now about where it was in the late ’50s. But a strategy focused on education will not tip the balance. As Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute points out, the list of remedies is long. It includes raising the minimum wage, increasing unionization, banning mandatory arbitration for employment claims, ending arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling, and ensuring that companies that subcontract their low-wage work remain in some way accountable for the workers. Or how about restoring competition to labor markets? Mr. Krueger and Eric Posner of the University of Chicago write that the government could stop companies from forcing low-pay workers to sign noncompete covenants, which bar them from better-paid jobs elsewhere. It should also ban no-poaching arrangements of dubious legality among franchisees of the same company, which also close off workers’ options. Over the last 50 years, employers have been allowed to exercise ever more sway over their workers. The share of private-sector workers covered by unions has dwindled to a sliver. Businesses have grown to imposing heft. All along, executives and policymakers have sold this rebalancing of power as a boon for competitiveness, efficiency and economic growth. And yet unbalanced labor markets not only hold back wages but also stymie the American economy as a whole. As Mr. Krueger pointed out to me, a rigged labor market is not efficient. Barring anti-competitive hiring practices will increase economic efficiency and encourage both higher wages and more employment. Better training will improve workers’ productivity, but so will helping them relocate to better operations. Rebalancing the labor relationship might not only improve the way the pie is shared but also make it bigger.",6626

The United States cable company’s 22 billion pound ($31 billion) offer for Sky, the British pay-television group, leaves Rupert Murdoch, Fox’s chairman, with two unappealing options: enter a bidding war for Sky, or rethink his deal to sell Fox’s entertainment assets to Disney. Sky’s investors owe a big thank you to a store employee near the group’s London head office. Mr. Roberts’ interest in the broadcaster firmed up after an hourlong demonstration of its flagship Sky Q TV product during a trip at the end of last year. Comcast is offering £12.50 a share in cash for Sky, comfortably beating Fox’s bid of £10.75 per share for the 61 percent of the company it does not own. Comcast’s slim operations in Britain mean the bid should raise few competition concerns. 21 Century Fox, by contrast, has been told by regulators that its bid risked giving the Murdoch clan too much influence over Britain’s news agenda. It’s now waiting for the publication of a final report that will detail regulators’ recommended remedies, such as a separate editorial board for Sky News. Media Secretary Matt Hancock will have the final say in the summer. Comcast reckons its expertise funneling television shows, sports and movies directly to homes makes it a better owner for Sky. How the $183 billion group’s own shareholders will benefit is unclear: Comcast’s offer contains lots of detail about supporting creative industries and young people in Britain, but little about financial returns. That may be because Mr. Roberts’s real objective is to upset a $52 billion all-stock tie-up that Disney and Fox announced in December. Comcast still covets Fox’s assets, Reuters reported earlier this month. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has described Sky as Fox’s “crown jewel.” Comcast’s offer will go ahead if just over 50 percent of Sky shareholders accept it. That means Fox’s 39 percent stake will not be enough to block the deal. Mr. Murdoch, therefore, has two options: revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with Mr. Roberts. Sky shares jumped by a fifth on Tuesday morning and now trade almost 7 percent above Comcast’s bid. Investors have placed their bets.",2281

5a9592cb410cf7000162e3fe,2018-02-27T17:17:53+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/craft-breweries-local-economy.html,Business,"MIDDLETOWN, N.Y. — As Equilibrium Brewery opened for business here on a recent Saturday morning, fans were already lined up outside for a fresh batch of its hazy-colored ales. The travelers, who came from Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, snapped up as many cans and bottles as they could buy, at $16 a four-pack. After a sip or two by tailgates, some headed out in search of a meal, their tourist dollars funneled into a downtown betting on a rebound. “We are having an impact on the community, for sure,” said Ricardo Petroni, a co-owner of Equilibrium, which opened in 2016 in a former meatpacking plant that had been seized over nonpayment of taxes. “When we moved here, you could see old scars of bad times,” Mr. Petroni added, “but you can tell that now, new things are flourishing.” Across the country, in once-bustling manufacturing centers, breweries are giving new fizz to sleepy commercial districts. If alcohol-based businesses were blamed for a breakdown of society in the Prohibition era and beyond, breweries are now being seen as a force for good. “The economic ripple effects are definitely there,” said David Barnett, a Chicago-based senior research analyst for JLL, the commercial brokerage firm. Breweries “create a cool tourism aspect for out-of-towners, but it’s been good for residents as well.” In 2016, there were 5,301 mom-and-pop beer makers, which are typically known as craft breweries. That figure rose from 4,548 in 2015, when the country surpassed its historic high-water mark of 4,131 breweries, set way back in 1873, according to the Brewers Association, a trade group. (Zero were recorded from 1920 to 1932, during Prohibition.) Although they are small, those breweries pack an economic jolt. In 2016, they contributed about $68 billion to the national economy, the association said. In recognition of their importance, craft breweries received an unexpected gift in the recent rewrite of the tax code. The Senate included a provision that lowered the tax rate on beer produced in the United States, particularly for small breweries. That special treatment comes on top of generous subsidies from local communities eager to bring business to their struggling industrial districts. The Northeast, Midwest and West still represent much of the industry, but 36 states doubled their production of craft beer from 2011 to 2016, according to Mr. Barnett, who last year wrote “The Craft Beer Guidebook to Real Estate,” a JLL report. “It’s hard to ignore an industry that has grown this much,” he said. In searching for places to make specialty beverages like sour beers and stouts, breweries seemed to adhere to a formula. They like early-20th-century buildings with up to 10,000 square feet and lofty ceilings, said Sandy A. Barin, a vice president with the commercial real estate firm CBRE based in Minneapolis who counts brewers among his clients. Usually renters instead of owners, breweries in Minneapolis typically sign five-year leases and pay $4.50 a square foot annually, Mr. Barin said, although tenants are usually on the hook for renovations, even if landlords offer credits for finishes like paint and carpeting. “The setup is usually pretty expensive,” he said. Breweries also seek up-and-coming locations that are within walking distance of houses and apartments, according to Mr. Barin, who added that the popular neighborhood in his city is North Loop, a former manufacturing district that churned out plows and threshers. Over all, breweries, usually with tap rooms, occupy about 624,000 square feet in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro region, up from 507,000 square feet in 2016. And in 2017, 11 new breweries opened in that area, according to CBRE, with 11 more expected this year. Offering food broadens breweries’ appeal, making a visit to them into “more of an all-inclusive night out,” Mr. Barin said. Breweries typically open an adjoining restaurant, but in Minneapolis, they often forge partnerships with food trucks that park outside. Modist Brewing, which opened in 2016 in a former North Loop salt factory, has several food trucks to serve hungry customers. Breweries have boomed nationally in the last few years. The industry was on track to post a growth rate of 5 percent in 2017, based on midyear calculations, said Bart Watson, the association’s chief economist. “We haven’t seen much of a slowdown,” he said. But in many places, the industry remains highly subsidized, raising questions about whether breweries can make it on their own, and how long that might take. The building that houses Equilibrium, for instance, was sold to the brewery for $260,000, with $225,000 of that forgivable if the brewery remained in business for at least five years, said Mr. Petroni, who along with his partner, Peter Oates, invested $1.4 million to upgrade the property. Ten people work there today. In addition, Equilibrium benefited from a sales-tax exemption on construction materials and a short-term reduction in property taxes, among other local incentives. The nearby three-year-old Clemson Brewing Company, a tall brick former saw-blade factory also seized for back taxes before its current incarnation, received similar breaks, which Middletown officials called necessary. “We realized in the 1980s and 1990s that industry wasn’t really coming back to any of these cities,” said Maria Bruni, the economic development director of Middletown. “Our community is very supportive because we’ve been staring at these buildings for 20 years and doing nothing.” Financing from New York State, which under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has become a major backer of the brewing industry, seems to also be a key. Equilibrium, for example, has so far received $204,000 in state grants. Mr. Cuomo, who took office in 2011 and is now in his second term, has also relaxed industry laws over the years. Brewers can now sell beer by the glass at their plants if their recipes partly use locally grown products, which many credit for the explosive growth of breweries in New York. In February, there were 390 craft breweries in New York, according to the state’s Liquor Authority, up from 97 in 2012. From densely settled Brooklyn to small towns by the Canadian border, the breweries include the Newburgh Brewing Company, which occupies an 1850s former box factory; Battle Street Brewery, in a former train station in Dansville, near the Finger Lakes; and Pressure Drop Brewing in Buffalo, in a former barrel factory. The Binghamton area has also become a hot spot. If residents support incentives, they do not always agree that alcohol will improve a community, said Chris Andrus, a co-founder of Mitten Brewing Company in Grand Rapids, Mich. Though breweries are plentiful, none were on the city’s west side, a blue-collar former furniture-making center, when Mr. Andrus and his partner, Max Trierweiler, sought to open one in a dormant 1891 firehouse. Neighbors who were worried that another bar would hurt the struggling area spoke out at zoning meetings, he said. But opponents may have come around since the brewery opened in 2012. Mitten closes earlier than bars in the area, Mr. Andrus said, “and we attract a lot of families.” The brewery, which is profitable, seems to have also attracted investment in the neighborhood. Across the street is a gin distillery, in a former clothing store, and another corner has a barbecue joint, in a former hamburger stand. Other breweries have also arrived in the area. Perhaps unsurprisingly, property values are also on the rise. Mitten’s 6,000-square-foot firehouse, which cost $220,000, is worth about $600,000, Mr. Andrus said, which is “largely because of us.” Whether craft breweries are a fad or will endure may come down to drinkers’ tastes, but evidence suggests passion for the product is high. On that January day in Middletown, Bob Helligrass and Jaime Loughridge, friends from the Albany area, sat eating lunch at Tapped, a bistro next to Equilibrium that opened around the same time. Before buying India pale ales at Equilibrium, the pair had also hit up the two-year-old Hudson Valley Brewery in Beacon, N.Y., to buy some of its beverages, while also snagging a meal along the way. “Breweries,” Mr. Helligrass said, “have benefits all down the line.”",8264

Cameras are getting brains. Until the past few years, just about all cameras — whether smartphones or point-and-shoots or CCTV surveillance — were like eyes disconnected from any intelligence. They captured anything you put in front of them, but they didn’t understand a whit about what they were seeing. Even basic facts about the world eluded them. It’s crazy, for instance, that in 2018, your smartphone doesn’t automatically detect when you’ve taken naked pictures of yourself and offer to house them under an extra-special layer of security. But all this is changing. There’s a new generation of cameras that understand what they see. They’re eyes connected to brains, machines that no longer just see what you put in front of them, but can act on it — creating intriguing and sometimes eerie possibilities. At first, these cameras will promise to let us take better pictures, to capture moments that might not have been possible with every dumb camera that came before. That’s the pitch Google is making with Clips, a new camera that went on sale on Tuesday. It uses so-called machine learning to automatically take snapshots of people, pets and other things it finds interesting. Others are using artificial intelligence to make cameras more useful. You’ve heard how Apple’s newest iPhone uses face recognition to unlock your phone. A start-up called Lighthouse AI wants to do something similar for your home, using a security camera that adds a layer of visual intelligence to the images it sees. When you mount its camera in your entryway, it can constantly analyze the scene, alerting you if your dog walker doesn’t show up, or if your kids aren’t home by a certain time after school. It doesn’t take long to imagine the useful and very creepy possibilities of cameras that can decipher the world. Digital cameras brought about a revolution in photography, but until now, it was only a revolution of scale: Thanks to microchips, cameras got smaller and cheaper, and we began carrying them everywhere. Now, A.I. will create a revolution in how cameras work, too. Smart cameras will let you analyze pictures with prosecutorial precision, raising the specter of a new kind of surveillance — not just by the government but by everyone around you, even your loved ones at home. The companies making these devices are aware of the privacy dangers. Many are moving into the field gingerly, slathering their products with safeguards that they say reduce the creepiness. Take Google’s Clips, which I’ve used for the past week and half. It’s one of the most unusual devices I’ve ever encountered. The camera is about the size of a tin of mints, and it has no screen. On its front, there’s a lens and a button. The button takes a picture, but it’s there only if you really need it. Instead, most of the time, you just rely on the camera’s intuition, which has been trained to recognize facial expressions, lighting, framing and other hallmarks of nice photos. It also recognizes familiar faces — the people you’re with more often are those it deems most interesting to photograph. Clips, which sells for $249, makes taking pictures unconscious and all but invisible. Carry it around wherever you go; the camera has a handy case with a big bendy clip, so it can be affixed to your jacket, set on a tabletop, carried in your palm or placed anywhere else with a view. From there, it’s all A.I. Clips watches the scene, and when it sees something that looks like a compelling shot, it captures a 15-second burst picture (something like a short animated GIF or Live Photo on your iPhone). I took a trip with my family to Disneyland last week, and over two highly photographable days, I barely took a photo. Instead, this tiny device automatically did the work, capturing a couple hundred short clips of our vacation. Some of them were quite good, getting the high points of our trip in the same way I might have with my phone. Here’s a clip of my son driving a car. But what was really interesting was the stuff I wouldn’t have consciously captured. I got dozens of pictures like these: Aesthetically, these pictures aren’t masterworks. Emotionally, they’re on a higher plane. Clips caught moments of my kids goofing off and fighting in Disney’s endless lines, playing catch at home, dancing like adorable maniacs — moments too spontaneous or seemingly slight for me to have caught with my camera, but that will probably paint a more accurate and edifying picture of our lives in 30 years. Regular readers of this column know that capturing moments of my kids’ childhood is an acute anxiety of mine; I’ve even wired my home with cameras to preserve a kind of reality show of life in my house. But you don’t have to be as crazy as I am to share slivers of this fear — that your kids or your pets are constantly doing things that you’ll later want to remember, but that smartphones often miss. An intelligent camera gets these times because it doesn’t ask you to break the moment to capture them. But, obviously, setting up a camera that doesn’t need to be specifically triggered to take a picture is problematic. It raises the worry of spying — that Google can spy on you, or that you can use it to spy on others. Google addresses that creepiness in two ways. The device is mostly unconnected from the internet. It can take pictures without a connection, and it requires your phone for viewing or saving the clips. But even then, all its A.I. happens on the device, and it doesn’t even need you to have a Google account, the company said. “We spent a lot of time thinking about privacy, and making sure this was a device people would actually want,” said Eva Snee, who heads Google’s research on how people interact with Clips. “What we learned was that cameras don’t creep people out when they’re used deliberately and the person is part of the process.” Clips also raises the memory of other products in this vein, including Snap’s Spectacles and Google Glass, the search company’s failed attempt to get consumers to use glasses that can take photos. To ensure that, Clips is designed to look like a camera. When it’s on, it flashes a white LED to signal that it could be recording. It also does not record audio, because that might have felt too much like spying. Lighthouse, which I’ve also used for a few weeks, is meant to be an upgrade over the internet-connected home security cameras that have become popular. Those devices can be annoying because they freak out every time they spot any movement. Lighthouse’s special trick is a camera system that can sense 3-D space and learn to recognize faces — intelligence meant to avoid false alarms. It also has a nifty natural-language interface, so you can ask it straightforward questions: “What did the kids do when I was gone?” will show you clips of your kids when you were gone. Lighthouse, which sells for $299 and requires a $10 monthly subscription, feels like a work in progress. It was mostly accurate in differentiating people in my house, but it was also tripped up into thinking I had an intruder by a mylar balloon floating around my living room. The company is young, and I expect its software to improve. I can see it being of genuine use to people who wonder what’s happening at home when they’re away. Want to know if your dog is jumping on your couch? Ask Lighthouse; it can recognize dogs jumping around couches, and will instantly show you the clip. (Well, it can get close. I don’t have a dog, so when I asked Lighthouse that question, it pulled up a clip of my kid kicking his stuffed tiger off the couch.) But what if it’s your spouse, not your pooch, you’re worried about? I trust my wife, but for the sake of this column, I asked the device to show me any clips of her in the house with an unfamiliar person. There she was one evening, with the babysitter, whom Lighthouse hadn’t seen before. It was a case of straight-up spying on my family. But it’s an obvious possibility with a camera that understands the world so well. Alex Teichman, Lighthouse’s chief executive, said it could add safeguards against inter-family spying, for instance by restricting face identification only to unrecognized faces. He also pointed out that the system has numerous fine-grained privacy controls that allow you to turn off any recording when certain family members are present. I found his response credible. Both Lighthouse and Clips are well crafted against abuse. It should be noted that neither one allows for much more spying than we can already accomplish with smartphones; constant social surveillance is the norm in 2018. But they are guides to the future. Tomorrow, all cameras will have their capabilities. And they won’t just watch you — they’ll understand, too.",8859

Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in his public debut on Tuesday that his expectations for domestic economic growth have increased since the beginning of the year, citing the passage of the $1.5 trillion tax cut and stronger global growth. In testimony before Congress, Mr. Powell said that the Fed planned to continue increasing its benchmark interest rate only gradually, as it did under his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. But investors responded to his optimism as an indication the Fed may be compelled to move more quickly. As Mr. Powell testified, stocks fell, the dollar strengthened and bond yields rose. Mr. Powell told the House Financial Services Committee that headwinds once holding back the American economy had now turned into tailwinds. “My personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December,” Mr. Powell said. Yet he struck a careful tone. Inflation has remained sluggish for nearly a decade, and Mr. Powell said the Fed “will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy” and allowing inflation to tick up toward the Fed’s target of a 2 percent annual pace. Most Fed officials forecast in December that the Fed would raise rates at least three times in 2018, as it did last year. Mr. Powell said he “wouldn’t want to prejudge” the new set of projections that officials will issue in March, but said they would take a recent run of strong economic data, including continued job growth and increased business investment, into account. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate in March, into a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, and most expect another quarter point increase in June. Some Wall Street analysts said that Mr. Powell’s testimony increased the chances that the Fed would continue with quarterly rate hikes in the second half of the year. “We are naturally more confident in our standing call for four hikes this year and another four next year,” said Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. But the Fed has emphasized that stronger growth is necessary to justify three rate hikes this year. Fed officials have also said growth will not prompt the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate more quickly unless it increases inflationary pressures. Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chairman for supervision, said Monday that the tax cuts could increase the country’s economic capacity, allowing faster growth without faster inflation. His remarks suggested the Fed is willing to wait and see what happens. “I will be carefully watching indicators of economic activity and inflation and assessing the degree to which activity appears to be pushing up against the constraints of the economy, as opposed to being a reflection of the expansion of those constraints and the growth of the potential output of the economy,” Mr. Quarles said. Lawmakers grilled Mr. Powell on Tuesday on many subjects. House Republicans, who pressed for Mr. Trump to put a Republican in charge of the central bank, asked Mr. Powell how he would respond to changes made after the 2008 financial crisis, including stronger financial regulations and a new approach to managing interest rates. Democrats, nervous about the new leadership, pressed Mr. Powell for assurances that the Fed would remain committed to supporting job growth and that it would enforce laws aimed at reducing discrimination by financial institutions. Both sides sought Mr. Powell’s affirmation for their views about the economic effect of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that took effect in January. Mr. Powell began his remarks by commending Ms. Yellen on her tenure and calling for continuity with her policies. But the differences between Mr. Powell, a former investment banker, and his predecessor, a labor economist, showed through. Unlike Ms. Yellen, Mr. Powell shied away from questions about economic inequality, and he spoke more freely about financial regulation. Mr. Powell reaffirmed to House members that the Fed intends to loosen some limits on banks. One change could reduce capital requirements for some large banks, allowing them to rely more heavily on borrowed money. The goal of the changes is to reduce the burden of regulation “without losing any safety and soundness,” Mr. Powell said. He also said the Fed plans to reduce regulation of smaller banks. He added the Fed must be alert to both the buildup of financial imbalances and inflation, but that neither risk appeared high at the moment. “There’s always a risk of a recession at any point in time, but I don’t see it as at all high at the moment,” Mr. Powell added. “I would expect the next two years on the current path to be good years for the economy.” Stocks took a tumble this month as investors began to chew on the possibility of faster rate hikes. Mr. Powell dismissed the turbulence, saying the Fed saw no evidence that it was “weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market and inflation.” The losses on Tuesday were more modest. The Standard & Poor’s 500 lost 1.27 percent, closing at 2,744.28. Mr. Powell has taken the helm of the central bank as the economy is nearing the end of its ninth year of expansion. The Fed has been steadily raising its benchmark rate back to a more normal level after cutting it nearly to zero to stimulate lending in response to the financial crisis. Those rate hikes are intended to keep the economy from running too hot, while also giving the Fed the capacity to fight a future recession by once again cutting interest rates. Although a strong economy and low unemployment typically drive up inflation, it has remained puzzlingly low in recent years. Mr. Powell acknowledged the trend, but said that he believed sluggish price increases were due in part to temporary factors and that inflation would gradually rise this year. He noted, however, that some indicators suggest the labor market still has room for improvement, including the modest pace of wage growth. The share of working-age adults who are not working also remains significantly higher than before the recession; most of those people are not counted in the unemployment rate because they are not actively seeking work. Investors are watching carefully for any indication that inflation could lift off faster than they expected — a sign that the Fed might have to raise rates more quickly than it planned and risk choking off economic growth. On Monday, Mr. Quarles was cautiously optimistic that faster economic growth is likely. “There are indications that we have a sustainably stronger economy,” Mr. Quarles said. “It’s a little too early to call that as happening, but there are clear indications that it could be happening.” Mr. Powell, a member of the Fed’s board of governors who was sworn in as chairman this month, will testify again on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.",6915
5a954d22410cf7000162e314,2018-02-27T12:20:43+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/dealbook/comcast-fox-sky.html,Business,"Happy Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Comcast is fighting Fox over the British broadcaster Sky. • How will Powell discuss loose fiscal policy? • Delta shows pushing back against the N.R.A. has political costs. • Will the U.S. challenge Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm on national security grounds? Want this in your inbox? Sign up here. Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney’s deal for a large part of 21st Century Fox: make a bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky. The offer, writes Liam Proud of Breakingviews, leaves Fox with two unappealing options to save its deal with Disney. Rupert Murdoch can either “revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with” Comcast. Sky investors seem to be betting on the latter option. Its stock jumped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. The reason for that may be that “both Fox and Disney have reasons for wanting to possess all of Sky,” writes Chris Hughes of Bloomberg Gadfly. “Fox may want full ownership as an insurance policy against the sale to Disney failing. And Disney’s desire to buy Fox’s current stake in Sky suggests it likes the asset, wants more of it and would want to prevent Comcast owning it.” In fact, Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has called Sky the crown jewel of his company’s purchase of Fox assets. Reaction • Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James: “The potential for Fox to return and make a competing bid remains high, in our view, as our European investment team believes Sky is the best-in-class European leader in Pay-TV.” When is an offer an offer can be a fine point under Britain’s complicated takeover rules. On Tuesday, Comcast announced a “possible all-cash offer” to acquire Sky, the British satellite broadcaster, for about $31 billion . Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has been trying to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for more than year, both responded that “no firm offer” had been made. That may seem like an odd distinction when Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, announced publicly how much it is willing to pay for an asset to kick off negotiations. But, that comes down to Britain’s extensive takeover code, which spans more than 400 pages, and can often trip up American companies not used to operating under those rules. The public disclosure of merger talks is triggered under the code when a number of factors occur, such as rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or “untoward movement” in a takeover target’s stock price. Making a public announcement then starts a countdown clock for a potential acquirer to announce a formal offer under the rules, known as a so-called firm intention to make an offer. The rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers. - Chad Bray We’d waited to see if Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and C.E.O., would challenge Walt Disney for control of 21st Century Fox. Instead, he plans to disrupt Mr. Murdoch’s bid for full control of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster. What Comcast is offering: £12.50, or about $17.50, a share for all of Sky What Fox is offering: £10.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own Behind the maneuvers Comcast had worked on its own offer for Fox, with the chance to expand internationally through Sky being a big reason for bidding. But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval. However, Fox’s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast’s opportunity. What Mr. Roberts said in Comcast’s regulatory statement: “We already have a strong presence in London, and Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for our growth in Europe.” Whom to thank for the Comcast bid Critics’ corner • Paul Richards of the media research firm Numis told the FT that Comcast’s bid is a “very strong competitive offer.” • Alex DeGroote at Cenkos Securities told Bloomberg, “The market was anticipating another approach and will be pleasantly surprised.” Market reaction Comcast investors don’t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky’s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval. Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit. A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump. So, how might Mr. Powell express concern about loose government fiscal policies? He can talk about Congress’s stimulus as just one of many factors that can have an impact on the Fed’s mission of creating the economic conditions for maximum employment and stable prices. In other words, he could depersonalize any tensions, and imply that concern about spending and deficits is just the Fed doing its job. And in his prepared testimony for the hearing, Mr. Powell noted the stimulus from fiscal policy. (F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed’s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.) Update from the hearing In this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond. He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: “Fiscal policy changes can have an effect.” He also said: “We really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.” On the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. “We don’t do fiscal policy at the Fed,” he said. — Peter Eavis That’s according to GeekWire and confirmed by CNBC.

5a953a55410cf7000162e2e0,2018-02-27T11:00:31+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/media/hollywood-diversity.html,Business,"LOS ANGELES — For the past five years, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, have hammered Hollywood with annual reports on its exclusion of women and minorities. Academics at the University of Southern California and San Diego State University have done the same. The public has weighed in with #OscarsSoWhite. The pressure has changed the business — a tiny bit. That is the conclusion of the fifth annual U.C.L.A. report on diversity in Hollywood’s entertainment industry, which was released on Tuesday by the university’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. “Over the five-year run of the report, areas where women and people of color saw sustained progress were rare,” Ana-Christina Ramón, an author of the study, said in an interview. “You’d think there would be better results, especially given the public pressure and the ratings and box office evidence, which clearly show that diversity sells. Audiences want it.” The 80-page report, conducted with funding from companies like Disney and the Will & Jada Smith Family Foundation, includes data broken into chapters that focus on areas like directors, lead actors, talent agency representation and television series creators. As with most studies, it gives a slightly outdated snapshot, examining the top 200 theatrical film releases in 2016 and 1,251 broadcast, cable and digital platform television shows from the 2015-16 season. Hollywood executives are likely to pounce on that lag, noting the recent success of the Disney-Marvel superhero film “Black Panther,” which has become the top-grossing film in history by a black director (Ryan Coogler) and featuring a largely black cast. Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time,” directed by Ava DuVernay from a screenplay by Jennifer Lee and starring Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling, will arrive on March 9. According to the report, two areas that showed substantial progress were minority leads on broadcast television shows, moving to 18.7 percent, up from 5.1 percent during the 2011-12 season, and show creators of color delivering scripted series for streaming services, which went to 15.7 percent from 6.2 percent, in large part because of the overall growth of streaming. But more common were slight increases and even some declines. Minority film directors, for instance, saw virtually no change over the five years (to 12.6 percent from 12.2 percent), and female film writers fell to 13.8 percent from 14.1 percent. “I do see change starting to happen, especially in television,” Ms. Ramón said. “But the entertainment industry moves slowly, and the problem is that, at this rate, parity is a very long way off.”",2666
5a951235410cf7000162e272,2018-02-27T08:09:19+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/dealbook/comcast-sky.html,Business,"LONDON — Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney Company’s plan to buy most of 21st Century Fox: topping Fox’s bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky with its own $31 billion takeover offer. The bid, plans for which were announced on Tuesday, seizes upon 21st Century Fox’s difficulties buying the piece of Sky that it does not already own. British regulators have expressed repeated concerns about giving Rupert Murdoch and his family more control over the country’s media, stretching the approval process out over more than a year and forcing 21st Century Fox to offer more concessions. Comcast has said that buying Sky would help it expand in Europe, where the broadcaster has 23 million customers and owns rights to show the English Premier League and other professional soccer leagues. Disney, too, has been keen on expanding internationally, with the British company serving as an important part of its $52 billion plan to buy a significant portion of 21st Century Fox. Whoever prevails, it will shake up Disney’s plans. Either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for Sky, or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast. In a statement, 21st Century Fox said that it “remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky,” which it made in 2016. Disney, Comcast and others are rushing to strike major deals in a swiftly changing media landscape. AT&T has bid more than $85 billion to take over Time Warner, a proposed merger that the Justice Department is attempting to block. Consumers increasingly stream their movies and televisions shows over the internet. Upstart technology companies like Apple and Amazon nurture ambitions to rival Hollywood’s big studios. Online broadcasters are even increasingly bidding for the rights to show sports — long a major moneymaking business for traditional broadcasters and cable operators. The saga over Sky has been one of the most drawn out deal-making dramas in media. Mr. Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, has tried for years to take full control of the broadcaster, which he started in 1989. By owning the rest of Sky, 21st Century Fox would be better positioned to take on the likes of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming giants. In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was forced to withdraw a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain. The scandal eventually led to the closing of The News of the World, the first newspaper Mr. Murdoch acquired in Britain in the late 1960s. In December 2016, 21st Century Fox tried again, in an effort to expand its global reach and cement Mr. Murdoch’s legacy. The company agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not own for about $16 billion. While the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, ruled in June that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were “fit and proper” to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, it also said that the deal warranted more scrutiny. In the regulator’s view, the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to “significant corporate failures.” Then last month, Britain’s competition regulator provisionally rejected the deal, saying that it was “not in the public interest.” The regulator said it was concerned that the deal would give the Murdoch family “too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” It noted at the time that Murdoch-controlled outlets, which include the newspapers The Sun and The Times of London, were already consumed by nearly a third of Britain’s population. In hopes of winning over regulators, 21st Century Fox has offered to establish a “fully independent” editorial board for Sky News and to continue to fund the Sky News brand after the transaction for at least 10 years. 21st Century Fox had hoped to complete the Sky deal before the Disney sale was finalized. But Comcast’s move just adds uncertainty to an already complicated process. Disney, which declined to comment on Comcast’s proposal, must now decide how much it cares about Sky. It is also not clear if Disney would want to end up being partners with Comcast, in the event that Comcast wins majority control of Sky and Disney ultimately has Fox’s 39 percent stake. While announcing the planned purchase of Fox’s entertainment assets in December, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, singled out Sky as “a real crown jewel” in a television interview with Bloomberg. “We certainly would be looking forward to the opportunity to have Sky be part of our company,” he said. Comcast has circled 21st Century Fox in the past. Last year, the cable giant was in preliminary talks to buy the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the minority stake in Sky. Disney ultimately prevailed. At the very least, Comcast has most likely made it more expensive for 21st Century Fox to buy all of Sky. Under the terms of its proposed bid, Comcast said, it would pay 12.50 pounds, about $17.50, a share in cash. That would represent a premium of 13 percent over its closing price on Monday and is about 16 percent above 21st Century Fox’s current offer of £10.75. On Tuesday, shares of the British broadcaster jumped by nearly one-fifth. The stock surge suggested investors expected 21st Century Fox to back away or come back with an even better offer. Comcast shareholders seemed less pleased. The company’s stock price dropped more than 6 percent in midday trading, to about $37. Disney shares fell 4 percent, to about $105.50, and Fox shares declined 2.6 percent, to about $37.80. An influential media analyst, Craig Moffett, who follows Comcast for MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note that the Sky offer had positive aspects, including offering Comcast’s entertainment unit, NBCUniversal, broader distribution in Europe. Still, “Comcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won’t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the U.S.,” Mr. Moffett said. “Perhaps worst of all, this morning’s bid doesn’t really put to rest the idea that they might still try a topping bid for Fox’s U.S. assets, including the rest of Sky” if the Justice Department ends up approving AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner. “The notion that Comcast might make a topping bid for Fox has weighed heavily on Comcast shares,” he added. For either Comcast or Disney, Sky offers a platform for international expansion. Comcast said in a statement that about a quarter of its revenue would come from international operations should it seal a deal with Sky, up from 9 percent currently. In addition to its other businesses, Sky has also announced plans to start streaming services in Spain and Switzerland. “We look at Sky as a media company: Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies,” Brian L. Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. “There’s tremendous presence in the content creation, not just the distribution.” In a research note on Tuesday, Polo Tang, a UBS analyst, said that Sky could be “strategically interesting” to a variety of bidders, given its content and its broadcast and streaming distribution network. It also recently retained the rights to the Premier League at a lower cost than analysts had expected. Mr. Tang said that the benign outcome of the Premier League auction potentially “gives Fox scope to raise its offers.” Comcast said it was seeking control of more than half of Sky’s shares with Tuesday’s offer but was ultimately interested in acquiring all of the British broadcaster. In a statement, Sky urged shareholders to take no action yet. The broadcaster added that its independent directors “are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the U.K. Takeover Code.”",7743
5a951038410cf7000162e26f,2018-02-27T08:00:49+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/italy-economy-election.html,Business,"TARANTO, Italy — Like millions of young Italians, Elio Vagali confronts career options that range from minimal to nonexistent. At 29, he has cleaned homes, picked tangerines and lifted rocks — nearly always off the books, without the protections of a full-time contract. In a measure of his desperation, his dream employer is the dilapidated steel mill that dominates life in this fading city on the Ionian Sea. The complex has been blamed for a cancer cluster in the surrounding community. Yet to Mr. Vagali, it beckons like a portal to another life, one that means moving out of his parents’ apartment. Except the plant isn’t hiring. “You either know somebody, or you don’t get in,” he said bitterly. “There’s nothing here for me.” All of which helps explain why Mr. Vagali and much of the Italian electorate is either indifferent or contemptuous of the national election campaign that, on March 4, will determine who runs Europe’s fourth-largest economy. The country’s bleak prospects have improved in recent years, but not enough to meaningfully lift its citizens’ fortunes. Many companies are growing without hiring. What jobs have been created are largely temporary and part time. Nearly 30 percent of voters are undecided, according to polls. The unpredictability of the outcome amid economic unhappiness has enhanced the chances that the result could generate financial tumult in Italy and threaten a fresh shock for Europe. Anti-establishment parties are drawing support from the economically distressed — especially the populist Five Star movement, which is leading in many polls. Given that Five Star has previously called for Italy to ditch the euro currency, if it were to triumph it would present European leaders with a fresh challenge to the continent’s cohesion. Most analysts doubt Five Star can gain enough seats in the legislature to form a government. But there is a remote possibility that the party could forge a coalition with the right-wing Northern League, an alliance that could rattle financial markets, prompting investors to demand higher interest rates for loans to Italy. “It would increase uncertainty,” said Mujtaba Rahman, the London-based managing director for Europe at the risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “The markets could be spooked.” The more likely outcome is a coalition led by a rehabilitated Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia party, following his years of disgrace for tax evasion and reports of sex-filled bacchanals. If Mr. Berlusconi emerges from the wilderness to become an Italian kingmaker, that too could roil Europe, given that he has previously scoffed at European rules limiting deficit spending. One might expect Italy to be in a more optimistic mood. The economy is expanding, albeit slowly, following a decade of crisis. Companies are tentatively hiring. A slow-motion banking disaster has largely been contained, as growth has limited bad loans while the most rickety institutions have been bailed out and restructured. Still, more than 32 percent of Italians under 25 remain unemployed, while the overall jobless rate is 11 percent. Even after three years of modest growth, the Italian economy remains slightly smaller than it was in early 2004, after accounting for rising prices. “The general perception is actually very gloomy,” said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss, a university in Rome. “The recession was particularly bad. A lot of people lost their jobs. A lot of people lost their savings.” Young Italians see the political class as having failed to refashion an ossified economy in which the elite maintain beach houses, fancy cars and extravagant wardrobes, while everyone else grapples with stagnation. They denounce the still-cozy world of banking in which insiders steer money to politically connected firms while would-be entrepreneurs struggle to secure capital. They also resent paying taxes to finance comfortable pensions, certain that such funds will be exhausted when they reach their senior years given Italy’s monumental public debt. “Voting is useless,” Mr. Vagali said as he stood outside the gates of the steel mill. “Nothing changes.” Here in the south of Italy, the hardship is especially intense, reflecting a decisive geographic divide. Northern Italy has Milan, with its financial center and high fashion, and industrial enclaves that make cars. The rugged beauty of the south, where vineyards and olive groves spread across verdant land, has seen scant material gains. Industry is minimal, and livelihoods are challenging. There has been some progress. Here in Puglia, the region that forms Italy’s heel, fortunes have improved in recent years. The regional unemployment rate has dropped below 18 percent, from nearly 20 percent in 2016. Exports from Puglia grew nearly 9 percent last year, with pharmaceuticals, agricultural machinery and food leading the charge. The trouble for Italy — as for much of the world — is that rising company fortunes no longer produce many jobs. In a vast rectangular plant outside Bari, Puglia’s capital, Francesco Divella, 70, presides over the pasta-making business that bears his family name. Started by his grandfather in 1895, the business today fills six plants, exporting roughly one-third of its wares to 120 countries, including Germany, the United States and Japan. Since the 1980s, the plant has roughly quadrupled its production, while its work force has less than doubled, reaching 320. “We are technology oriented,” said Mr. Divella, the chief executive. “We are able to increase production without adding people.” Inside the factory, enormous machines clatter at high decibels, turning flour and water into sheets of pasta, slicing it into spaghetti, and carrying it into ovens for drying. Sensors looking for trouble along the line provide real-time alerts to computers tucked inside a control room. The control room was empty on a recent morning, the machinery running itself. Outside, a lone worker patrolled the cavernous plant. Only in the back of the operation, where pasta is packaged and hoisted into a warehouse, are humans found in numbers. Those tasks are the target for the next phase of automation. Divella just bought a German robotic system that will run self-driving forklifts in its warehouse at night. Even within its professional ranks, Italy is full of economic insecurity, undermining enthusiasm for the elections. Less than five years after she graduated from university, Emanuela Muolo, 28, has already given up her dreams of a career in the field she studied, financial law. She first worked an unpaid job at a local law firm, hoping to gain experience. She never secured a paid position, so she shifted her focus to banking, searching throughout Italy for a job while she worked as a restaurant hostess. Recently, she settled into a full-time position at a job center in Bari, helping unemployed people with their quests for a paycheck. She earns about 1,100 euros a month (about $1,360). She and her boyfriend have been together for five years. They contemplate marriage and starting a family, but they both live with their parents. The professional roadblocks she has encountered have left Ms. Muolo confused about the election. Her boyfriend plans to vote for Five Star. She plans to skip the polls. “It doesn’t feel real,” she said. “Ultimately, we feel far away from Rome.” In Taranto, Rome’s influence is a visceral force as the Ilva steel mill — one of the largest in Europe — spews toxic dust that blackens the windows of surrounding neighborhoods. The plant began production in 1964 as a state-owned enterprise, its very existence the result of Rome’s designs on developing the south to create jobs. Almost immediately, the community began suffering the consequences. Mercury and dioxin seeped into the aquifer, tainting produce and sheep herds, a source of prized cheese. Children coughed up black mucus while succumbing to elevated rates of cancer, according to many studies. Mussels in the bay, once prized, are now eschewed as dangerous. In 2012, a local magistrate cited health issues in ordering the shutdown of major parts of the plant, by then in private hands. But the central government in Rome used an emergency decree to override that decision to preserve some 20,000 jobs. The government took control of the plant in 2015, and last year struck a deal to sell it to ArcelorMittal, a global leader in steel, pending an antitrust review. Meanwhile, the mill remains in operation. In the Tamburi neighborhood, a grid of crumbling concrete block apartments with laundry billowing from their balconies, residents have grown accustomed to watching young people move away. “There’s no more jobs around here,” said Ignazio D’Andria, proprietor of a local cafe. Mr. D’Andria does not plan to vote. “I’ve tried the left,” he said. “I’ve tried the right. Our lives haven’t changed.” Standing next to the bar, Alessio Peretto grimaces at that attitude. He works at the Ilva plant, and he favors Five Star, given the party’s talk of building a new economy centered on green energy. “Give them a chance,” he said. The rest of the crowd inside the cafe was not buying it. They have seen this stretch of southern Italy fester for decades before Rome constructed a catastrophe in the name of jobs. The land is poisoned, people are sick, and now even the jobs are imperiled. To them, the politicians seem like flies landing on a corpse. Two older men leaned against the wall, hoisting bottles of beer after a day spent cutting slabs of marble in a nearby graveyard. “In the cemetery, that’s where we find work,” said Antonio Caniello, 69. “Death is the only sure thing.”",9652
5a94b831410cf7000162e1ce,2018-02-27T01:46:34+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/technology/driverless-cars-california-rules.html,Business,"SAN FRANCISCO — California regulators have given the green light to truly driverless cars. The state’s Department of Motor Vehicles said Monday that it was eliminating a requirement for autonomous vehicles to have a person in the driver’s seat to take over in the event of an emergency. The new rule goes into effect on April 2. California has given 50 companies a license to test self-driving vehicles in the state. The new rules also require companies to be able to operate the vehicle remotely — a bit like a flying military drone — and communicate with law enforcement and other drivers when something goes wrong. The changes signal a step toward the wider deployment of autonomous vehicles. One of the main economic benefits praised by proponents of driverless vehicles is that they will not be limited by human boundaries and can do things like operate 24 hours in a row without a drop-off in alertness or attentiveness. Taking the human out of the front seat is an important psychological and logistical step before truly driverless cars can hit the road. “This is a major step forward for autonomous technology in California,” said Jean Shiomoto, director of California’s D.M.V. “Safety is our top concern and we are ready to begin working with manufacturers that are prepared to test fully driverless vehicles in California.” While most of the companies leading the race for driverless cars are based in California, some have started testing autonomous vehicles in Arizona, where the state government has taken a more hands-off approach to the technology. Arizona has not created regulations for autonomous vehicles. Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, started testing autonomous vehicles without safety drivers on Arizona roads in October. Since then, it has picked up passengers in driverless vehicles and it plans to start a ride-hailing service without human drivers later this year. Uber has also deployed autonomous vehicles in Arizona, but it uses safety drivers in those cars. “This is a significant step toward an autonomous future in the state, and signals that California is interested in leading by example in the deployment of autonomous vehicles,” Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement. John M. Simpson, a director for Consumer Watchdog, a frequent critic of Alphabet’s self-driving car initiative, said the new rules will threaten highway safety as remote operators try “to control the robot car from afar.” He said the oversight will turn driving these vehicles into a video game “except lives will be at stake.” California requires companies to report the number of “disengagements,” or instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle. Waymo had the fewest number of disengagements — based on a per mile basis — of all the companies testing cars on California roads. Between December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers intervened 63 times — or about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Over the last few years, Waymo has made steady progress in reducing the instances when people need to retake the wheel.",3179

On Monday, the National Labor Relations Board reversed its reversal. The move will make it easier to hold companies responsible for labor law violations committed by franchisees and contractors. Labor advocates and business groups alike were surprised by the turnabout, but it did not reflect any ideological shift. Rather, it followed a determination that a member of the board’s Republican majority had a conflict of interest in the earlier vote. A report released in early February by the agency’s inspector general found that the member, William J. Emanuel, should have recused himself when the case came before the board in December, shortly after the Republicans gained control. That would have left it split at two votes apiece and preserved the status quo. On Monday, three other board members, including its Republican chairman, Marvin E. Kaplan, voted to vacate the December decision, citing a determination that Mr. Emanuel “is, and should have been, disqualified from participating in this proceeding” because his former law firm had handled a related case. That opens the door for the more expansive, Obama-era standard to remain in place for several more months, perhaps even years. Wilma B. Liebman, a Democratic former board member who served as chairwoman early in the Obama administration, said it was highly unusual for a labor board ruling to be reversed because of a conflict — perhaps illustrating the stakes involved. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ms. Liebman said. Two Democratic senators, Patty Murray of Washington and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been outspoken in recent months in pointing to Mr. Emanuel’s potential conflicts. The issue before the board involved a doctrine known as joint employment. A company, like a fast-food corporation, that is deemed a joint employer of workers at a franchisee can be held liable for violations of their labor rights — such as illegally firing workers involved in an organizing campaign — and can be required to bargain with them if they unionize. Before 2015, a company could be considered a joint employer under federal labor law only if it exercised direct and immediate control over workers at the franchise. But in a case known as Browning-Ferris, the board ruled that the parent company could be deemed a joint employer even if the control it exerted was indirect — for example, if it forced the franchisee to use software that committed it to certain scheduling practices. The board ruled that the parent company could also be considered a joint employer if the company had the right to exercise control over a franchisee that it did not exercise in practice. The more liberal definition of who qualified as a joint employer removed a potentially significant obstacle to workers at fast-food restaurants and hotels who sought to unionize. A parent company that terminates a franchise agreement to avoid doing business with a franchisee whose workers are trying to unionize may face legal liability for doing so if it is considered a joint employer. In December, the board, with its new Republican majority, took up a case known as Hy-Brand and voted to revert to the pre-2015 standard requiring direct and immediate control. But that case did not raise any questions that hinged on what standard to apply — the Obama-era guidelines or the previous ones. Partly as a result, the inspector general argued in his report, it was simply a pretext for relitigating Browning-Ferris. “The practical effect of the Hy-Brand deliberative process was a ‘do-over’ for the Browning-Ferris parties,” the inspector general stated. This created the potential conflict for Mr. Emanuel, whose former law firm had represented a party in the Browning-Ferris case. If the more recent case was simply a do-over for the previous case, the inspector general argued, then Mr. Emanuel should have recused himself. Ms. Liebman, the former chairwoman, said the board would presumably be able to try again. But she said it would have to wait for a case raising its own questions about which joint-employer doctrine is correct, rather than simply use any vaguely related case as a pretext for revisiting the Obama-era decision. “In some future case, where the issue actually arises and some party is seeking a reversal of Browning-Ferris, where more of a deliberation goes on, that could be another vehicle,” she said, adding that there was less likely to be a conflict for Mr. Emanuel in that instance. “This is likely just a reprieve.” For their part, business groups frustrated with the frequently shifting joint-employer definition argued that it was yet another reason for Congress to settle the issue with legislation. “This throws the whole situation back into question for a potentially extended period,” said Matthew Haller, a senior vice president at the International Franchise Association. “Our focus has been — and remains — on the need for Congress to provide legislative certainty.” Mr. Haller added that the House had passed such legislation in November and that it was now all the more urgent for the Senate “to step into the breach.”",5213
5a94a391410cf7000162e1a3,2018-02-27T00:17:16+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/business/media/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html,Business,"LOS ANGELES — Two weeks ago, the embattled Weinstein Company looked like it had finally found a way forward. An investor group had emerged with a plan to buy 90 percent of the studio’s assets, including rights to “Project Runway” and a 277-film library. The new company would be primarily led by women. For the Weinstein Company, crippled in wake of sexual misconduct allegations against its co-owner Harvey Weinstein, the offer was the only way to keep the studio intact and its 150 employees working. Other potential buyers only wanted to cherry-pick properties, and the studio was nearly out of money to keep running. But the Weinstein Company’s board — or at least the three men remaining on it — said late Sunday that the sale talks, which had been teetering since a lawsuit had been filed this month by the New York State attorney general,  had fallen apart. By Monday, finger-pointing over who was to blame had begun. And the studio’s future seemed to be a court-directed sale or liquidation, with assets sold off in bankruptcy proceedings like scrap from a wrecked car. “There’s nothing pretty about this,” said Larry Hutcher, a corporate lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron in New York who has been following the Weinstein Company’s struggles. “It’s likely going to be a free-for-all that stretches on for months.” Since October, when the Weinstein Company began to implode after reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein, very little has gone as expected. At one point, two female-led investor groups were competing to buy the assets, with one intending to give profits to organizations focused on ending harassment, sexual abuse and discrimination. So there is always the possibility of another twist. The Weinstein Company has yet to file for bankruptcy — it said on Sunday that a filing would happen “over the coming days” — leaving open the possibility, however unlikely, that the two sides could come to an agreement. Before the deal fell apart, the investor group had offered to pay roughly $275 million for the Weinstein Company, plus the assumption of $225 million in debt. Leading the effort was Maria Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama. Backers included Ron Burkle, the billionaire investor, and Lantern Capital, a Texas private equity firm. “It appears that this transaction has now ended,” Ms. Contreras-Sweet said in a statement on Monday, adding that the Weinstein Company’s move had “surprised” her. “While our efforts did not materialize as we had hoped, I am grateful for my investors who saw the compelling value of a women-led board.” The Weinstein Company declined to comment. In announcing its bankruptcy plans on Sunday, the company’s board said in a statement, “While we recognize that this is an extremely unfortunate outcome for our employees, our creditors and any victims, the board has no choice.” The studio also made public a sharply worded letter that it sent to Ms. Contreras-Sweet and Mr. Burkle on Sunday that blamed her for failing to “keep your promises” about interim funding. It was in November when Ms. Contreras-Sweet first sent a letter to the board outlining her proposal. “I will be chairwoman of a majority-female board of directors,” she wrote. “Women will be significant investors in the new company and control its voting stock.” She also proposed creating a fund for victims and establishing a mediation process for reaching settlements. After failing to find other buyers who would keep the studio intact — Lionsgate, Shamrock Capital Advisors, Killer Content and the Qatari company beIN Media Group were among those considering various pieces — the board entered into exclusive negotiations with Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group in late January. Most of the studio’s all-male board had quit in early October. Those who remained were Mr. Weinstein’s younger brother, Bob Weinstein; Tarak Ben Ammar, a Franco-Tunisian financier and film producer; and Lance Maerov, an executive at the advertising giant WPP Group. By Feb. 10, a Saturday, the two sides were finalizing a deal. The Weinstein brothers, who jointly own about 42 percent of the company, would receive no cash from the sale. Other equity holders would also be wiped out. Bob Weinstein, who had been running the studio since the firing of Harvey Weinstein in October, would step down. According to two people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private process, the Weinstein Company and Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group were set to formalize the agreement that coming Monday. Then came a curveball. In a phone call on the evening of Feb. 10, two lawyers who work for Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, told Ms. Contreras-Sweet that they had reviewed the proposed deal and wanted to discuss three major concerns, according to the people briefed on the talks. Those were adequate compensation for victims, protections for the studio’s remaining employees and no financial rewards for studio executives who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein’s misconduct. (Mr. Weinstein has denied ever engaging in “non-consensual sex.”) Ms. Contreras-Sweet said she believed the proposal addressed those points, but declined to have a substantive conversation. On Sunday, Feb. 11, Mr. Schneiderman, frustrated by a continued lack of responsiveness from the investor group to his queries, filed a lawsuit against the studio and the Weinstein brothers alleging that they repeatedly violated state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment and coercion. And he held a news conference the next morning in which he publicly stated his three requirements for a deal. “As of yesterday, there was no deal that would have met these standards,” he said. In particular, he said, “there was no victim compensation fund.” By the end of that week, Mr. Schneiderman had started to get what he wanted. The Weinstein Company, for instance, fired its president, David Glasser, on Feb. 16. Mr. Glasser had been expected to run the new studio; Mr. Schneiderman had pointed to him as one of the managers who perpetuated Mr. Weinstein’s behavior. Ms. Contreras-Sweet and Mr. Burkle also met with Mr. Schneiderman and discussed plans to create a full-fledged victim compensation fund, ultimately earmarking up to $90 million. But the Weinstein Company emailed a letter to the investor group on Sunday saying the deal was dead. “Over the past two weeks, we had very productive discussions with both parties,” Eric Soufer, Mr. Schneiderman’s director of communications and senior counsel, said in a statement on Monday. “We are disappointed that despite a clear path forward on those issues — including the buyer’s commitment to dedicate up to $90 million to victim compensation and implement gold-plated H.R. policies — the parties were unable to resolve their financial differences.” Mr. Soufer added, “We will continue to pursue justice for victims in the event of the company’s bankruptcy.” Bankruptcy would push the pause button on the many lawsuits, some of which predate the harassment revelations, that are pending against the company. “Think of it like musical chairs,” said Jack Tracy, head of legal analysis for Debtwire, a distressed debt research firm. “The music stops and then a judge puts everyone in their chairs one by one.” (Lawsuits can continue against Mr. Weinstein personally unless he makes his own bankruptcy filing.) The Weinstein Company could pursue a Chapter 7 filing, which involves the appointment of an independent trustee to run a liquidation. Filing for Chapter 11 is perhaps more likely, because it would allow the studio more control over the sale of assets. “The important thing in the case of this particular company,” Mr. Tracy said, “is that bankruptcy allows assets to be sold free of liability.”",7913
5a94943f410cf7000162e17b,2018-02-26T23:11:53+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/business/tax-cuts-share-buybacks-corporate.html,Business,"President Trump promised that his tax cut would encourage companies to invest in factories, workers and wages, setting off a spending spree that would reinvigorate the American economy. Companies have announced plans for some of those investments. But so far, companies are using much of the money for something with a more narrow benefit: buying their own shares. Those so-called buybacks are good for shareholders, including the senior executives who tend to be big owners of their companies’ stock. A company purchasing its own shares is a time-tested way to bolster its stock price. But the purchases can come at the expense of investments in things like hiring, research and development and building new plants — the sort of investments that directly help the overall economy. The buybacks are also most likely to worsen economic inequality because the benefits of stocks purchases flow disproportionately to the richest Americans. The tax overhaul is the cornerstone of Mr. Trump’s economic plan. It has been a big win for companies, offering lower corporate rates and a permanent break on overseas profits. Warren E. Buffett said in his annual letter to investors on Saturday that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, enjoyed a $29 billion gain thanks to the new tax law. What companies do with the trillions of dollars they’re bringing back to the United States, and the money they will save each year on their tax bills, will in large part determine whether the plan is a success or a failure. As the tax cuts kick in, companies have laid out a variety of uses for the money. Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories. In the fourth quarter, American companies’ investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul. But the buying back of shares is also at record levels. Almost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks — the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm. Such purchases reduce a company’s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie. Cisco said this month that in response to the tax package, it would bring back to the United States $67 billion of overseas cash, using $25 billion to finance additional share repurchases. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, authorized up to $8.6 billion in stock purchases. PepsiCo announced a fresh $15 billion in planned buybacks. Chip gear maker Applied Materials disclosed plans for a $6 billion program to buy shares. Late last month, home improvement retailer Lowe’s unveiled plans for $5 billion in purchases. On Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire’s stock — and the broader market — higher. More buybacks are almost certainly on the way. UBS analysts covering Apple said the iPhone maker might authorize another $30 billion in share purchases when it reports its next quarterly earnings in April. That would be on top of the $30 billion it already spends each year to buy back its shares. “I’m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,” said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. “And if I’m disappointed, there’s a lot of people with me.” The flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with “buy” orders helped the market recoup some of its losses. The broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks. Ultimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds. Companies typically decide to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories based on whether they will make the company more profitable — not merely because the companies are sitting on a pile of money that they otherwise would have paid in taxes. At a news conference Thursday, the head of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, acknowledged that many companies were spending their money on buying their own shares. “Right now we’re going to have an adjustment where you see probably more dividends and share buybacks than wage increases,” Mr. Hassett said. “But going forward we’re going to see a lot of capital formation and wage growth.” That is not what happened in 2005, when a one-time tax holiday allowed companies to repatriate money on the cheap. That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy. Some $300 billion came back to the United States that year. But economists estimated that as much as 92 percent of it may have been paid out to companies’ shareholders — mostly in the form of buybacks. Studies have shown that the tax change lifted companies’ stock prices but did not expand their American work forces. Until the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices. But in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules. Historically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.’s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company. Buybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. That was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks. Some economists think the surge in share buybacks has something to do with the relative decline in capital investments, which recently have been lower  than expected. “We have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn’t do,” said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “And maybe that’s causing them to reduce investment.”",7282
5a9481ef410cf7000162e13b,2018-02-26T21:53:45+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/business/you-might-be-a-gun-owner-even-if-you-dont-possess-a-weapon.html,Business,"You probably are a gun owner. You might not actually possess a gun. But if you have a pension or a 401(k) or an investment in index funds, there’s a good chance that, directly or indirectly, you own shares of one or more gun manufacturers. Like it or not, that means that your financial incentives are at least partly aligned with those of gunmakers. And in general, the more guns they sell, the more money their shareholders — in other words, you — make. The school shooting this month that killed 17 people in Parkland, Fla., has intensified scrutiny on the various ways in which financial institutions and other companies prop up the firearms industry, whether through lending money to gun companies or having marketing partnerships with the National Rifle Association. Many companies have severed their ties to the N.R.A. Blackstone, the private equity giant, recently contacted the hedge funds that it owns, asking about their holdings of gun stocks. Here is how individual investors, including people whose only investments are through their retirement plans, are financially connected to the gun industry — even if they don’t realize it. A number of state pension funds own shares in the gun makers. For example, pension funds for public employees in Florida, Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio all have stakes of less than 1 percent in American Outdoor Brands, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, which is the manufacturer of the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle that has been used in a number of recent mass shootings. TIAA, which oversees retirement investments for educators and teachers, has small stakes in American Outdoor Brands and two other publicly traded gun companies. The pension fund for teachers in New York State also has very small positions in the gun companies Sturm Ruger and Vista Outdoor. The investments represent slivers of the pension funds’ overall assets, but they nonetheless are generating debate. New Jersey lawmakers last week moved to cut off investments in gunmakers by the state pension plan. Exchange-traded index funds, which are designed to track the performance of various market indexes, are all the rage these days. They hold the shares of every company in whatever index they’re tracking. These indexes include the Russell 2000 index for small companies and the Standard & Poor’s Aerospace & Defense Select Industry index. That means these investment firms own the stocks, not because they see investment value in them, but because they are part of a broad stock index. Two of the world’s biggest asset managers, the index giants BlackRock and Vanguard, are now among the top shareholders of three publicly traded gun companies: Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor. BlackRock has an 11 percent stake in American Outdoor Brands, while Vanguard’s stake is 8 percent. For Sturm Ruger, BlackRock owns 17 percent while Vanguard has 9.5 percent. BlackRock said it would be contacting officials at the three publicly traded firearms companies, asking them about how they were responding to the shootings. Vanguard has taken a more cautious stance. With 20 million clients, the firm said it was unrealistic to cater to such a wide variety of views on pressing social topics. “We believe mutual funds are not optimal agents of social change,” a spokesman said. Vanguard does offer clients a way to screen funds for stocks that they do not want to invest in. While index funds are prominent shareholders of these gun companies, some large mutual funds — in which portfolio managers individually pick stocks — are also substantial owners. One of the world’s biggest fund companies, Capital Group, which oversees $1.6 trillion in assets, has an 8 percent stake in Sturm Ruger. A spokesman for Capital said on Monday that the investment firm “was engaging with gun manufacturers to understand their plans to ensure the safe use of these products.” And the mutual fund giant Fidelity is the top shareholder of Vista Outdoor, with 15 percent of the company. The stake is held largely through Fidelity’s actively managed funds.",4067

Beijing’s takeover of one of the country’s biggest spenders threatens to bring it to a near stop. The Chinese government’s seizure of Anbang Insurance Group on Friday has regulators in the United States and elsewhere struggling to figure out what that means to the properties the company owns around the world. It is also raising questions about Beijing’s deep role in the Chinese economy and its sway over private companies — especially those that own or run big businesses abroad. In Washington, the Anbang takeover has galvanized lawmakers and Trump administration officials who have called for the United States to take a tougher look at Chinese purchases of American companies. Officials in Canada and Europe are also watching closely to see how the takeover affects Anbang’s businesses in their backyard. “If it can happen to Anbang, it can happen to any number of Chinese firms looking to gain a share of our critical industries, infrastructure and technologies,” said Robert Pittenger, a Republican representative from North Carolina. That scrutiny could test what has long been a ready source of money for companies in the United States and elsewhere. For years, China was an enthusiastic and big buyer of hotels and real estate, entertainment companies and logistics companies in the United States, rewarding those who put the deals together. But those warm business ties between China and the United States are cooling. The White House has labeled China a strategic rival. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing through a bill that would expand regulatory inquiries into Chinese deals. And Wall Street has put the brakes on financing some of China’s deal making amid accusations that they failed to properly vet the buyers. The Trump administration has expressed concerns about investments by Chinese companies in United States firms in areas where Beijing wants to be dominant, like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. The Anbang takeover will most likely add to that trepidation. “Regulators will naturally be somewhat concerned by the reality that often there is an asymmetry of information about the Chinese firms operating internationally,” said Jeremy Stevens, an economist for Standard Bank Group in Beijing. “This event further underlines this truth,” he added. Anbang has said it will carry on business as usual. “We remain fully committed to our overseas subsidiaries, business and investments,” it said in a statement on Friday. But already, Chinese companies aren’t buying — or sealing deals — like they once were. Newly announced Chinese acquisitions in the United States in 2017 fell to $8.7 billion, one-tenth the transaction value of acquisitions in 2016. It marks the lowest level in six years, according to data from Rhodium Group, which tracks Chinese investments abroad. Some of the drop in deals last year had to do with China’s skepticism of its large private conglomerates and its crackdown on what it called irrational spending overseas on trophy assets like the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, which Anbang bought in late 2014 for nearly $2 billion. High-flying giants like Anbang and its peers Dalian Wanda and HNA Group, which have large amounts of debt, have started shedding assets overseas. Some of the slowdown comes from American concerns as well. Just as the Chinese government announced its plans to take over Anbang last week, the American semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corporation announced that its $580 million sale to Hubei Xinyan, an investment fund backed by the Chinese state, had been blocked by American officials. It was the latest high-tech China deal blocked by Washington amid concerns that China could gain access to cutting-edge technology. A week before that, the Securities and Exchange Commission blocked a $20 million deal by a Chinese group to buy the Chicago Stock Exchange. On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump criticized the deal, using it as an opportunity to accuse China of taking American jobs and wealth. The Committee on Foreign Investment, the government committee that reviews foreign purchases of American companies in the United States, could become an even tougher hurdle. Mr. Pittenger, the congressman, is co-sponsoring a bill that would broaden the scope of the committee, known as Cfius. While the panel reviews deals for national security issues, Mr. Pittenger and others want it to consider economic and other factors in deciding whether to approve deals. “This cannot go unnoticed by those tasked to uphold our national security through Cfius and export controls,” Mr. Pittenger said, referring to China’s takeover of Anbang last week. With the government takeover, Anbang could be under pressure to begin to sell its many holdings overseas. These include hotels across the United States, a large stake in a South Korean bank, a Dutch insurance company and a South Korean insurance company. “Investors in companies outside China in which Anbang, Wanda or HNA own a stake of less than 100 percent should expect that the stake held by the Chinese investor will be put on the market over 2018,” said Gordon Orr, the former Asia chairman at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. These could “be pushed through very rapidly,” Mr. Orr added. Dutch regulators are reviewing the potential impact on Vivat, a Dutch insurance company that Anbang bought in 2015. On Friday Vivat said that the takeover would not affect Vivat or its clients. But it also added that it is an independent entity and subject to Dutch laws and regulations and was being monitored by Dutch supervisory authorities. De Nederlandsche Bank and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets, the two authorities that monitor Vivat, did not respond to a request for comment. In Canada, officials are taking a close look at a nursing home chain Anbang owns in British Columbia. In 2016, Anbang said it would purchase Retirement Concepts, a chain of more than 20 Canadian nursing homes. Retirement Concepts is the province’s largest nursing home chain and accounts for one in every 10 nursing home beds that are not directly run by local health authorities, according to the Hospital Employees’ Union of British Columbia. The Canadian government “has exclusive jurisdiction for matters of international trade and approved the purchase by Anbang in spite of significant concerns in B.C.,” said Adrian Dix, the health minister in British Columbia, in an emailed statement. “We believe that communication with patients, families and the general public on these types of matters should be done more transparently.” Government officials are concerned that Anbang, under government control, will be forced to sell the homes in a way that could put retirees at risk. “The care and well-being of patients must be at the center of our efforts and not the operator,” Mr. Dix said in the statement.",6919

U.P.S. had pursued the TNT merger in the hope of gaining a larger presence in Europe and in emerging markets, but European officials rejected it because of concerns that the transaction would decrease competition and increase prices. The General Court of the European Union annulled the decision by European Commission regulators last year, in part because the commission had used different economic models at different times to evaluate the deal. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has appealed that ruling to Europe’s highest court. Facing a deadline to seek damages, U.P.S. filed a claim in December seeking 1.74 billion euros, or about $2.14 billion, plus interest, according to a notice published on Monday. U.P.S. is also seeking court costs and compensation for any taxes it may have to pay on the damage amount. “We feel strongly that the proposed acquisition would have constituted a good deal for logistics customers,” Gregg Svingen, a U.P.S. spokesman, said on Monday. U.P.S. agreed to acquire TNT in a transaction valued at $6.8 billion in March 2012, but European regulators said they would block the deal because they were worried that a merger would effectively leave the Continent’s shipping market with just two main players: U.P.S. and DHL. In hopes of allaying those concerns, U.P.S. agreed to sell some business units and to grant rivals access to part of its airline network, but regulators were unmoved and U.P.S. withdrew its offer in January 2013. A shipping rival, FedEx Corporation, agreed to acquire TNT in a $4.8 billion deal in 2015, completing the deal after receiving approval from European regulators the next year.",1912

The wager has done pretty well already. Berkshire Hathaway started gobbling up Apple stock just over a year ago. At the end of last year, its Apple position had a market value of $28.2 billion, according to the letter. The position cost Berkshire $21 billion, the letter said, which suggests a gain of $7.2 billion, or over 30 percent. The bet also outperformed a soaring stock market. In the past 12 months, Apple stock is up 31 percent, versus 17 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. What do the numbers say now? Apple, by some metrics, looks cheap. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a valuation yardstick that compares a company’s per-share profits to its stock price, is 15.5 times forecasted earnings for 2018. Facebook’s stock is at 26 times, Google is at 27 times, and Amazon is at a dizzying 184 times. Apple’s ratio is even smaller than the overall market’s. The bullish theory: Apple’s stock price will keep rising as investors come to see that it is undervalued. But shouldn’t investors have realized this years ago? Apple, after all, is a famous company, and investors have long been aware of its fat profit margins, its grip on consumers and its ability to generate billions of dollars of cash flow. But Apple is unimpressive in a way that often worries investors: It is a slower growing company. Google, Facebook and Amazon are all expected to increase their sales at a significantly faster clip than the 10 percent that Apple achieved in 2017. It would take a large number of additional iPhone sales, at higher prices, for Apple to have the sales growth of Google. And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple’s iPhone X shows. Could investors become more bullish? It’s hard to know exactly why investors become willing to pay a lot more for certain companies. Amazon’s share price is up over 160 percent over the past two years, a period when business was strong, but not markedly stronger than investors expected. Sometimes the herd just changes its mind. And there are plenty of ways in which Apple excels. Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr. Buffett enthused about one. Once consumers own, say, an iPhone, they have a tendency to stay loyal to Apple products. “You are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using,” he said. — Peter Eavis With the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation. They may want to keep fretting, though. James W. Paulsen, a stock market strategist at the Leuthold Group, put out some new research on Monday that suggests that the inflation rate, 2.1 percent in January, could move a lot higher in coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculate a metric that draws on both economic and financial data to try and assess the amount of inflation that is brewing in the economy. One version of the New York Fed’s “underlying inflation gauge” rose by 3 percent in January. Mr. Paulsen took historical data for this yardstick and found that, in the past, it was quite a good predictor of actual inflation. “Although not perfect and while the lead/lag relationship varies over time, the underlying inflation gauge has done a good job of forecasting future movements in the core inflation rate during the next 18 months,” he wrote. If this relationship holds up, inflation could be 2.6 percent by the end of this year, and 3 percent by the middle of 2019, Mr. Paulsen wrote. Of course, the relationship might break down in the near future. Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month. — Peter Eavis But the two remain far apart on price. On Monday, Qualcomm’s board in a letter to Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive, said the two sides have made progress addressing Qualcomm’s regulatory concerns and proposed the two companies hold a meeting that focuses on negotiating the price. From the statement accompanying the letter: But So what price is Qualcomm pushing for? The FT reports that “Qualcomm is insisting that Broadcom raises its offer by at least 15 percent to above $90 per share, up from its current $79 per share bid.” Republican politicians in Georgia, where Delta Air Lines is headquartered, are hitting back at the company, reports Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle tweeted: Rick Jeffares, a candidate for lieutenant governor and former Georgia state senator, weighed in with: Writes Ms. Josephs: He certainly sees the need. In his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders, Mr. Buffett said: But will he have the opportunity? Mr. Buffett bemoaned the sky-high purchase prices that “proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017.” Critics’ corner • Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly writes: “The best way Buffett can solidify his legacy is by returning to the M&A market with the same force and determination he’s always shown. He may need to pay more than he wants to, but what’s a little extra to Berkshire in the long run?” • Mr. Buffett is on the wrong side of a generational shift, writes John Foley in Breakingviews. In contrast, BlackRock and Vanguard have waded in and called for companies to do good. That attitude is already baked into the Buffett view, Mr. Foley writes, “But notions of what’s now referred to as ESG — environmental, social and governance factors — are otherwise fuzzy in Berkshire’s universe.” Other highlights from the letter • Berkshire’s windfall of $29.6 billion from the U.S. tax overhaul was only slightly offset by $1.4 billion of tax payments on repatriated earnings. Mr. Buffett did not expand on his recent criticisms of tax cuts. Read more about what he did focus on here. • Mr. Buffett railed against a new accounting rule that will affect future quarterly and annual reports. The change requires companies to include in earnings the gains and losses on stocks they hold but have not sold. Because Berkshire holds $170 billion of stocks, the impact on Berkshire’s bottom line could be significant. Peter Eavis of The Times notes: Related Michael Kives, a longtime Hollywood agent at Creative Artists Agency who has consulted and represented Mr. Buffett — as well as Mikhail Gorbachev, Katy Perry and Jessica Alba, among others — is striking out on his own with a new firm, K5. It will provide advisory services for companies “across media, sports, technology, finance, politics, and a variety of other industries,” according to an announcement expected to go out later today. United Parcel Service has sued European antitrust regulators for a decision they made five years ago that blocked its takeover of the Dutch delivery company TNT Express, according to a record of court proceedings published on Monday. U.P.S. had pursued the TNT merger in the hope of gaining a larger presence in Europe and in emerging markets, but European officials rejected it because of concerns that the transaction would decrease competition and increase prices. The General Court of the European Union annulled the decision by European Commission regulators last year, in part because the commission had used different economic models at different times to evaluate the deal. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has appealed that ruling to Europe’s highest court. Facing a deadline to seek damages, U.P.S. filed a claim in December seeking 1.74 billion euros, or about $2.14 billion, plus interest, according to a notice published on Monday. U.P.S. is also seeking court costs and compensation for any taxes it may have to pay on the damage amount. U.P.S. agreed to acquire TNT in a transaction valued at $6.8 billion in March 2012, but European regulators said they would block the deal because they were worried that a merger would effectively leave the Continent’s shipping market with just two main players: U.P.S. and DHL. U.P.S. withdrew its offer in January 2013. A shipping rival, FedEx Corporation, agreed to acquire TNT in a $4.8 billion deal in 2015, completing the deal after receiving approval from European regulators the next year. — Chad Bray Talks about a sale to a group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet have collapsed. The group had offered to pay about $275 million for the company, plus the assumption of $225 million in debt. The Weinstein board blamed Ms. Contreras-Sweet and one of her primary backers, Ron Burkle. “Late last night, you returned to us an incomplete document that unfortunately does not keep your promises,” it said in a letter. “That is regrettable, but not in our power to change.” The board, which includes Bob Weinstein, accused Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s team of failing to provide funding to keep the studio operating while the deal was completed and said she had proposed new sale conditions that meant the transaction would take much longer to close.

5a939870410cf7000162def5,2018-02-26T05:17:32+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/business/weinstein-bankruptcy-deal.html,Business,"LOS ANGELES — The Weinstein Company said that it would file for bankruptcy following the collapse of sale talks with an investor group, extending the damage from sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein, its co-owner and a onetime force in Hollywood. The beleaguered film and television studio said in a statement late Sunday that it had failed to reach a deal with a group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama. The group had offered to pay roughly $275 million for the Weinstein Company, plus the assumption of $225 million in debt. “While we recognize that this is an extremely unfortunate outcome for our employees, our creditors and any victims, the board has no choice,” the company’s statement said. “Over the coming days, the company will prepare its bankruptcy filing with the goal of achieving maximum value in court.” The Weinstein Company board, a three-member group that includes its co-founder Bob Weinstein, also released a sharply worded letter it sent earlier on Sunday to Ms. Contreras-Sweet and one of her primary backers, Ron Burkle, the billionaire investor. In the letter, the board members said they had worked “tirelessly” in recent days to meet “virtually every demand you imposed,” including waiving a breakup fee if a deal was not consummated. However, Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s team, according to the letter, had not come through with promised interim funding to keep the 150-employee studio operating while a deal was completed. The letter also said that she had proposed new sale conditions that could add “many months (or longer)” to the closing process. “Late last night, you returned to us an incomplete document that unfortunately does not keep your promises,” the letter said. “That is regrettable, but not in our power to change.” Representatives for Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s team did not respond to a request for comment. The Weinstein Company has been trying to avoid bankruptcy since October, when reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein. To stay afloat while it pursued a sale, the studio at first sought loans from private equity firms. When those efforts failed, the Weinstein Company sold off North American distribution rights to “Paddington 2,” an animated movie that was released in January. Through a spokeswoman, Harvey Weinstein has repeatedly denied “any allegations of nonconsensual sex.” The Weinstein Company’s announcement on Sunday came two weeks after Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, filed a lawsuit against the studio and its fraternal founders alleging that they repeatedly violated state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and coercion. The lawsuit, based on a continuing investigation into the Weinstein Company’s internal dealings, was accompanied by a public call from Mr. Schneiderman for assurance that a sale to Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group had three components: adequate compensation for victims, protections for the studio’s remaining employees and no financial reward for those “who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein’s misconduct.” That brought the sale talks to a sudden halt. In the wake of the lawsuit and Mr. Schneiderman’s public statements, the Weinstein Company fired its president, David Glasser, for cause. The lawsuit did not name Mr. Glasser, but it referred to him by his title and said that the sale of the company could result in employees’ reporting to some of the same managers “who failed to investigate” Mr. Weinstein’s conduct or protect female employees from him. In a statement, a lawyer for Mr. Glasser, Eve Wagner, said that Mr. Glasser planned to sue for wrongful termination. On Wednesday, Ms. Contreras-Sweet and Mr. Burkle met with Mr. Schneiderman in New York and made progress toward persuading him that their purchase would satisfy his three stated priorities, according to two people briefed on the matter who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. In particular, the sale was to include tens of millions of dollars for victims and a mediation process for reaching settlements. The Weinstein brothers, who jointly own about 42 percent of the studio, would have received no cash from the proposed sale, with other equity holders also wiped out. Eric Soufer, the director of communications for Mr. Schneiderman, said in a statement on Monday that the attorney general’s office had “productive discussions with both parties” during the past two weeks about how to accomplish his priorities. “We are disappointed that despite a clear path forward on those issues — including the buyer’s commitment to dedicate up to $90 million to victim compensation and implement gold-plated H.R. policies — the parties were unable to resolve their financial differences,” Mr. Soufer said. “We will continue to pursue justice for victims in the event of the company’s bankruptcy, and our investigation into the pattern of egregious abuse by Harvey Weinstein and his enablers is ongoing.” Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group had pulled ahead of other bidders like Lionsgate by promising to keep the studio intact and the staff employed. Other bidders were interested only in pieces of the Weinstein Company, namely its 277-film library, which includes titles like “The Imitation Game” and “Django Unchained.” The Weinstein Company also has a television division that makes “Project Runway” and is working on a pair of dramas for the Paramount Network, which is owned by Viacom. Other assets include a handful of unreleased movies, including “Polaroid,” a teenage horror movie; “The War With Grandpa,” a comedy starring Robert De Niro; “The Upside,” a comedy starring Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston; and “The Current War,” a period drama. The Weinstein brothers first came to prominence with Miramax in 1989, the year they helped activate the indie-film boom with “Sex, Lies and Videotape.” They sold Miramax to Disney in 1993 and left in 2005 to form the Weinstein Company. They unsuccessfully dabbled in side businesses, including a fashion label, but eventually found their film footing with releases like “The King’s Speech,” which won the Academy Award for best picture in 2010. Even so, recent years have been difficult for the studio. The Weinsteins have not had a mainstream hit at the North American box office since 2013, when “Lee Daniels’ The Butler” took in $116.6 million. The last time a Weinstein film was a force at the Oscars was in 2012, when “The Artist” collected five awards, including best picture.",6640

President Trump’s recent statements suggest that the threat of the United States imminently withdrawing from the agreement has receded in recent months. But the countries are still at odds over issues like rules on automobile manufacturing and investment. The countries will face a challenging task as they try to move toward consensus on these issues before the end of the negotiating round on March 5. Ana Swanson ECONOMY Jerome H. Powell, the new Federal Reserve chairman, who arrived in that role as a relative unknown, will make his public debut on Tuesday morning when he testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. On Thursday, he will reprise the performance before the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Powell has said that he plans to continue the Fed’s gradual retreat from its economic stimulus campaign, slowly raising interest rates and slowly reducing the Fed’s bond portfolio. While the economy is gaining strength, Mr. Powell is likely to emphasize that so far, stronger growth is increasing the Fed’s confidence in its plans, rather than giving it a reason to move more quickly. Binyamin Appelbaum Some events sell themselves: On Tuesday afternoon at the Brookings Institution, Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chairwoman, will be interviewed by Ben S. Bernanke, her predecessor at the Fed. It will be Ms. Yellen’s first public appearance since she completed her four-year term as Fed chairwoman this month. Both Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke are now fellows at Brookings and so free to speak candidly about their experience leading the Fed through the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Brookings says they’ll address Ms. Yellen’s career, “her time at the Fed, her observations about the current state of the economy and the challenges that confront us.” Binyamin Appelbaum After passage of the Republican tax overhaul in December, big companies including Apple and Walmart said they would share their tax savings with employees in the form of raises and bonuses. Economists are skeptical of the cause and effect, noting that the low unemployment rate is also putting pressure on companies to raise pay. But whatever the reason, the bonuses are real — and could show up in data that the Commerce Department will release on Thursday. The report, which covers Americans’ income and spending in January, won’t capture the direct effects of the tax cuts, which mostly didn’t show up in workers’ paychecks until February. But it could show the impact of bonuses and pay increases, as well as any extra spending they might have generated. Don’t expect a big bump, however: Economists surveyed by Bloomberg said both income and spending probably grew more slowly in January. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, will be watching the report for any signs that inflation is picking up. Ben Casselman GOVERNMENT More than 3,000 officials from across China will gather in Beijing at the end of the week for the annual twin sessions of the country’s top advisory body and the country’s Legislature. The advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, includes many tycoons and other business leaders and will start meeting on Saturday. The Legislature, the National People’s Congress, will start meeting the next Monday and is expected to stay in session for nearly two weeks. The congress typically starts with the annual work report of the premier, Li Keqiang. That is followed by the rubber-stamp approval of a long list of government initiatives — a couple of constitutional amendments are expected this year to cement the primacy of President Xi Jinping. Perhaps most important is that the congress will confirm a new slate of government ministers after the twice-a-decade Communist Party national gathering in Beijing last October. Most of the new lineup is already known, but considerable uncertainty surrounds who might succeed Zhou Xiaochuan, who turns 70 this year and is expected to retire after serving as governor of the central bank since 2002.

5a93641c410cf7000162deac,2018-02-26T01:34:11+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/gun-show-tampa-parkland.html,Business,"TAMPA, Fla. — The lines stretched out the door this weekend at a gun show in Tampa, Fla., as thousands of potential buyers and the merely curious waited for their turn to browse booths stocked with the latest firearms, ammunition, customizable holsters and patriotic paraphernalia. Inside, parents pushed their babies in strollers past T-shirts emblazoned with phrases like “I study triggernometry.” A nonprofit group in one booth was raffling off a rifle to raise money to battle child and animal abuse. On large signs by the entrance, the National Rifle Association was offering refunds on the $11 admission if shoppers signed up for a membership. Outside, Girl Scouts were selling cookies. But the deadly mass shooting a couple of hundred miles away at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School cast its shadow. Both buyers and sellers were talking about the attack, as well as about the divisive debate that it had recently reignited. And there, on many tables, were racks of AR-15s — variations of the hugely popular semiautomatic rifle used by the 19-year-old Parkland gunman. Several sellers said they were on track to double their normal sales for a weekend. “It’s sad to say, but whenever there’s a shooting, business only goes up because people are afraid of losing their right to own a certain weapon,” said Quaidman Woody, who was running a booth with his father, a sales representative for CrossHeirs. “So even if they don’t need another AR, they’ll buy another AR or pieces of it.” In the packed exhibition hall, attitudes toward firearms laws were far from monolithic. Kathy Fox, who was helping at a booth with collectible Winchester rifles exhibited upright on a turntable, said she was pleased that Representative Brian Mast, a Republican and Army veteran, who represents her district in Florida, had called for a ban on future sales of tactical rifles. But she added that “there’s nothing wrong with guns” and that “there are nuts everywhere.” “Everyone has a different perspective, a different outlook,” she said of her fellow show participants. “It’s not that they’re bad people.” The gun show was one of more than 40 around the country scheduled for this past weekend. Most were in the Midwest and South. A common refrain among buyers and sellers at the Tampa show was not to blame guns in the Parkland shooting. Instead, they argued, crack down on violent video games. Fix broken families. Bolster mental health screenings. Rely less on government protection. “We’ve lost our perspective on what’s really happening,” said Scott Rollf, who owns a company called 22mods4all. He said customer concerns about potential legal limits on guns had perked up sales after a decline in demand in recent months led him to reduce prices. Mr. Rollf said he approved of Gov. Rick Scott’s proposal to raise the minimum age in Florida to buy firearms to 21 from 18. He was also fine with banning so-called bump stocks and other attachments that increase firing speeds, which he views as “useless” for hunting and unsafe in other applications. Last week, President Trump, an avowed “champion” of gun owners, ordered the Justice Department to issue regulations on bump stocks, which were used in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas last October. Calls for gun control have intensified since the Parkland shooting, propelled by the students who survived the Feb. 14 attack and by a fast-moving boycott effort that led major companies like United Airlines and the Enterprise car rental business to cut ties with the N.R.A. Florida Gun Shows, which organized the Tampa event, canceled its Fort Lauderdale gathering next month at the request of Mayor Jack Seiler. Norman Carolino, who was selling body armor at the Tampa show, called the scrapped plans a disservice to people looking for protection. He said most of his sales on Saturday were to teachers, school administrators and “parents who are scared to death.” “I’m wiped out of everything,” he said. “There are parents in here who’ve never seen the inside of a gun show.” Juanita Stafford and her husband, Tommy, bought bullet-resistant backpack plates for their eight school-age grandchildren in Florida and Alabama. They received a bulk discount off the $199 price a pad. “We don’t want to be the people going to funerals and saying coulda, woulda, shoulda,” she said. “We’re putting our money where our mouth is.” Nearby, rows of handguns sat on cardboard boxes, in glass cases and nestled in velvet-lined cradles. Some sellers wandered the floor carrying signs advertising personal firearms, like a Colt AR-15 SP-1 rifle, for sale in private transactions, which do not require background checks. Mr. Woody estimated that only 10 percent of gun show shoppers were firearms aficionados. The rest, he said, are either newcomers or dabblers. Many buyers have never purchased an AR-15 before, he said. Mr. Woody, an 18-year-old college freshman in a Christ the Redeemer shirt and cargo shorts, said he supported spending to improve campus safety and incentives for teachers to keep firearms within reach but secured. But he decried efforts to raise the minimum age to buy semiautomatic firearms. “There’s a big stigma around the AR-15,” Mr. Woody said. “But say they ban it — if the person knows what they’re doing, they’re just going to buy a different gun that shoots the same caliber and does the same thing but doesn’t get included in the ban because it doesn’t look tactical.” Even before the Parkland shooting, the gun industry was distressed. Thriving demand for firearms after the Sandy Hook attack in 2012 and during President Barack Obama’s administration caused new gun companies to swarm the market. But many of those businesses have since scaled back or folded as enthusiasts became less nervous about potential gun legislation and less anxious to stock up. Remington, one of the oldest gun makers in the country, said it was preparing to declare bankruptcy. American Outdoor Brands, whose Smith & Wesson brand was well represented at the show, has complained about “challenging market conditions.” Show participants said the financial pressure on the industry and the renewed public attention on guns would make companies especially eager to bolster quality and safety — especially in military towns like Tampa and other markets with avid, discerning firearms customers. Lindsay Potter, who, with her husband, Garrett, was operating a booth for their company, Special Ops Tactical, described herself as a “big supporter” of the N.R.A. She also said she welcomed strict background checks, believed that sellers should use their discretion to refuse sales and appreciated audits by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “We are under a lot of scrutiny,” she said. “And we should be.”",6771
5a9362b0410cf7000162deaa,2018-02-26T01:28:11+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/energy-environment/saudi-oil-world.html,Business,"Saudi Arabia has long been the dominant force in oil, leaving the world at the mercy of its ambitions and its interests. Now the kingdom must refresh its strategy to reflect a weaker hand — and in many ways, a different game. The changing nature of the energy industry — the oil production boom in American shale fields, the persistence of lower crude prices, and the rise of natural gas — has transformed the geopolitical equation. While Saudi Arabia is still a major energy producer, it must compensate for its lost revenue. And the United States, China and Russia are all circling in hopes of gaining a financial advantage. Russia, smarting from Western sanctions and lower oil prices, is moving to embrace Saudi Arabia for energy deals despite their rivalry in Syria, where the two countries support competing sides. China, with its domestic oil production in steep decline, seeks a stable flow not just of Saudi oil but of Saudi investment in its growing petrochemical and refinery industries. And Washington is willing to overlook those flirtations in the hope that Saudi Arabia will continue to be a strategic bulwark against Iran. The desires of all three superpowers fit neatly into Saudi Arabia’s strategy to find new investment partners as part of a broader push to diversify its oil-dependent economy, trim large budget deficits and secure the future of both the kingdom’s welfare state and its monarchy. The keystone to the project is the proposed initial public stock offering of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, a deal that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The changing geopolitical game was on full display in December when Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, braved the Russian arctic cold as President Vladimir V. Putin’s guest of honor at the opening of a giant natural-gas export terminal. For Mr. Putin, it was an audacious embrace of an American ally as he moved to expand his nation’s energy riches despite the current sanctions. For Mr. al-Falih, it was a chance to discuss future gas sales, attract investment in Saudi Aramco and coordinate efforts to prop up global oil prices. “If we continue to work the way we do, we will turn from rivals to partners,” Mr. Putin told Mr. al-Falih at the public ceremony. The Saudi official readily agreed. The ultimate success of the Saudi Aramco public offering and the entirety of the kingdom’s economic reform remain in question, and progress so far has been mixed. Nevertheless, American, Chinese and even Russian financiers are entwined in a complex dance around the initial public offering, which is promised for later this year. President Trump has publicly called for the I.P.O. to be listed in New York. A Saudi listing now appears more likely, with additional trading in London or Hong Kong. Global financiers say they want a piece of the action wherever it occurs. The interest in the I.P.O. has given the kingdom greater leverage at a time when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, through which it has long wielded power, has lost much of its clout. “The Saudis are compensating for their lost power in OPEC and they are showing pure geopolitical pragmatism in their new energy and foreign policy,” said Bill Richardson, a former energy secretary and ambassador to the United Nations. “But they are not just compensating for lost power. They are adding to their power in world politics.” Saudi Arabia has had a central role in global energy since at least World War II. When the kingdom created a global glut of oil to gain market share in the mid-1980s, it sent prices into a tailspin that contributed to the bankruptcy of the Soviet Union at the same time that it was financing Afghan rebels fighting the Soviets. The kingdom was such a crucial supplier of oil to the United States that Washington went to war in the early 1990s in part to protect it from a possible Iraqi invasion. And when China needed new energy supplies for its expanding economy in the early years of the new century, Saudi Arabia was there with an ambitious oil exploration program to meet the new demand. But OPEC can no longer control oil prices alone. A flood of oil from American shale fields has enabled the United States to slash imports of OPEC oil and begin exporting to markets that were once dominated by Saudi crude. The Saudis, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are seeking to link cuts in OPEC production over the past two years with cuts by Russia, another oil-exporting powerhouse, to buoy prices. Over the longer term, the Saudis want to import natural gas to replace domestic consumption of oil for electricity, freeing more crude for export. At the same time, the country is expanding its investments in refineries and petrochemical plants around Asia and the United States to guarantee markets for its crude while making additional sales of higher-value gasoline, diesel and other refined products. “Low oil prices have made the Saudi way of life unsustainable, so they have to find alternatives,” said Bruce Riedel, a former Middle East analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and the author of “Kings and Presidents: Saudi Arabia and the United States Since F.D.R.” “Any partner they can find that can help them do that, they are going to embrace enthusiastically.” The most surprising partner is Russia, which remains on the opposite side of the Syrian civil war and is also trying to build better relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s bitter regional rival. In the fall of 2016, the crown prince’s father, King Salman, made the first official trip to Russia by a reigning Saudi monarch. Multiple cooperation agreements including military sales were reached, as well as a commitment by Russia’s largest petrochemicals company, Sibut, to build a plant in Saudi Arabia. Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, recently expressed interest in the Saudi Aramco public offering, even suggesting that a group of Russian and Chinese investors could join in a bid. Relationships between the Chinese and Saudi oil companies had already grown close in recent years. Aramco bought a 25 percent stake in a refinery in Fujian Province operated by the state-owned oil giant Sinopec, and the companies have joint refinery ventures in Saudi Arabia. China and Saudi Arabia also signed a preliminary agreement last summer to create a $20 billion investment fund for infrastructure, energy and mining projects. “We might as well work with them,” said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, a former Saudi Aramco executive vice president. “They desperately need energy, and we have a heck of a lot of energy, so the pieces fit.” Such deals also promote Saudi Aramco’s efforts to become a global refining powerhouse. That can only increase the value of the proposed initial public offering of the company, which already produces more crude than any other in the world. Many international banks, including JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, have been seeking to advise the kingdom and have a role in the eventual deal. “Every global investment bank should be interested in a lead role given the quality of the company and the fact that it would be the largest I.P.O. in history,” said Osmar Abib, global head of oil and gas at Credit Suisse Securities. The kingdom has valued the company at $2 trillion, a number that investment bankers say would be realistic only if oil were worth $100 a barrel, nearly $40 more than the current price. Many energy experts doubt that the stock offering will be completed because of persistent questions about the rule of law in Saudi Arabia, as well as the special privileges granted to Saudi royalty. They predict that members of the royal family will be reluctant to give up the confidentiality of their earnings from the company, which are now hidden from the public. At the same time, international investors have been shaken by the recent roundup of wealthy Saudis who were forced to pay large sums of money for their freedom from confinement in a hotel. “It’s going to be very hard for them to persuade anybody to buy a hunk of Aramco until they figure out how to be more transparent about the royals’ take and the actual value of the company,” said David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department’s top energy official early in the Barack Obama administration. Saudi oil executives say the issues of valuation and governance will be worked out in the end because the crown prince and his father view the public offering as central to remaking the economy with more foreign investment. “There is no backtracking,” Mr. al-Husseini said. “The I.P.O. commitment is driven by a central leadership, by people who are empowered to make decisions. It’s not a winding narrow road that comes to no conclusion.”",8830
5a9356f1410cf7000162de9a,2018-02-26T00:38:02+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/trump-trade-sanctions-aimed-at-china-could-ensnare-canada.html,Business,"WASHINGTON — China is the main target of possible tough new United States trade measures against low-priced imports of steel and aluminum. But the sanctions threaten to ensnare America’s closest allies, particularly Canada. Earlier this month, the Commerce Department declared the steel and aluminum imports  a national security threat, and President Trump must decide by mid-April whether to impose sanctions, including quotas and tariffs. But all of the options presented by the Commerce Department would affect Canada, a longtime supplier of metals to the American military and industry. Imports from Britain, Australia, South Korea and other countries could also be hit. President Trump could choose to accept one of the Commerce Department’s recommendations or fashion his own remedy. Either way, the issue highlights the difficulty the Trump administration faces as it seeks to limit imports in a world where companies routinely make, ship and sell products across borders. The potential trade action is further straining already-tense relations between the United States and Canada, two of the world’s most integrated economies. The countries have clashed over the North American Free Trade Agreement, American tariffs on Canadian lumber, and Canada’s recent complaint to the World Trade Organization about American trade practices. Last Thursday, James Mattis, the Defense Secretary, published a public letter concluding that the decline of the American industry as a result of unfair trade posed a threat to national security, a position aligned with the Commerce Department’s. But he urged the administration to proceed cautiously, particularly with regard to allies. The Defense Department “continues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies regarding the recommended options within the reports,” Mr. Mattis wrote. He urged the administration to consider tariffs targeted at specific countries and to focus on what he described as the underlying problem — Chinese overproduction. Yet the United States could face a challenge in crafting trade sanctions that circumvent allies and target China. It has already imposed a variety of restrictions on Chinese aluminum and steel. But American steel and aluminum producers argue that China still harms them indirectly by routing goods through third countries, as well as depressing global prices to a level where American manufacturers cannot compete. Although China has promised to cut its steel and aluminum capacity, it has made only slow, modest progress. That is why some American metal makers have argued for broader protections. Canada accounted for more than half of American imports of aluminum in 2016, followed distantly by Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Canada also made up the largest share of American steel imports in 2016 — 17 percent — followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey. China did not rank among the top 10 suppliers of either metal. “From a defense perspective, it makes no sense to limit imports from Canada in the future,” said Alf Barrios, the chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, which exports aluminum from Canada to the United States. “Canada is a longstanding, reliable supply for any needs the United States might have.” Canada’s inclusion in the Commerce Department recommendations was unexpected, in part because companies and workers have been relatively united in calling for the country to be exempted. The operations of many metal makers — as well as the United Steelworkers, their largest union — stretch across the border. Under law, Canada is included as part of the United States defense industrial base, and the growth of its aluminum industry dates back to supporting the United States during World War II. Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, said the recent level of animosity and trade tensions with the United States had surprised Canadians. “We see ourselves as close friends,” she said. “It’s unexpected that we would stand to be damaged by the United States, and vice versa.” Ken Neumann, the national director of United Steelworkers, struck a similar note. “There is no justification to include Canada with countries that systematically violate trade laws and engage in the dumping of illegally subsidized aluminum and steel,” he said after the release of the Commerce Department report. Canada is one of several allies that could be affected. Britain, Australia, Europe and Japan would also be included under the kind of blanket tariff or quota recently floated by the Commerce Department. The measures could fall particularly hard on South Korea, which was named as one of the countries that would face a 53 percent tariff on its steel exports, along with China, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey and six others, under one potential scenario in the report. The United States has been seeking South Korea’s cooperation to combat a nuclear threat from North Korea. But the Trump administration has simultaneously pursued the country on trade, largely because South Korea maintains a large trade surplus with the United States. The administration is renegotiating its free trade deal with South Korea, and the country was a target of an earlier tariff on washing machines. Including countries like Canada could lead to unintended ramifications for the United States military and economy. Many products made in America use foreign metals, including the Ford F-150, a classic American truck that is consistently ranked as one of the most “made-in-America” vehicles in an industry known for sourcing parts from around the world. The truck’s engine and transmission are American-made, and the truck is assembled in plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Claycomo, Mo. Even so, the truck is made of Canadian aluminum, some of which comes from Rio Tinto’s aluminum works in Quebec — an area with plentiful hydropower, which is needed for the energy-intensive process of producing aluminum. From Quebec, some aluminum travels to a plant in upstate New York owned by Novelis, which combines it with recycled aluminum and rolls it out into wide sheets for Ford. Another 15 percent of the value of the truck’s components come from Mexico. Its window wipers come from a factory in Matamoros, some of its wheels from Chihuahua, and some of the pistons in its engine from Ramos Arizpe. The auto industry says this web of North American suppliers allows it to produce cars and trucks at a quality and a price to compete with products made around the world. Ford exports the truck back to Canada, and last year it announced that it would begin exporting vehicles to China as well. Economists say the companies that make aluminum into car bodies and soda cans employ far more people than the smelters that make raw aluminum itself. Novelis, which specializes in recycling and rolling aluminum out into sheets, announced in January that it would invest $300 million to open a new factory in Guthrie, Ky., to make the aluminum sheeting used in cars. The same trends are true in the steel industry. In mid-February, 15 American industry associations that buy steel to make their products wrote a letter to Mr. Trump arguing that, by raising the price of steel, restrictions on imports could do more harm than good. They said they represented more than one million jobs in the United States, compared with about 80,000 jobs in primary steel production. Other economic forces are driving aluminum smelting from the United States. Aluminum manufacturing is extremely energy intensive, so it has tended to go to parts of the world with cheap excess energy, like the Middle East, Iceland and Canada. Smelters in the United States must compete with other, more profitable businesses for electricity, like computer server farms.",7736
5a93546d410cf7000162de96,2018-02-26T00:27:20+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/media/wooing-millennials-with-exotic-experiences-that-arent-too-costly.html,Business,"When Nicola Todd, 29, and Eva Mehesfalvi, 31, decided to visit Manhattan from England recently, they wanted a hotel that would be light on the pocketbook but big on the New York City experience. So instead of springing for a place with oversize rooms and round-the-clock room service, they chose the Moxy Times Square, which offered small but stylish rooms, quirky décor, lightning-fast Wi-Fi and eclectic lounge and bar areas, all at an affordable price. “I wanted something that felt very urban, very New York, something with a little bit of character,” Ms. Todd said. “I feel a lot of the Hiltons and Marriotts are very cookie-cutter. No matter where you are in the world, they all kind of feel the same.” The Moxy Times Square, however, is part of the Marriott empire. Marriott is just one of a growing number of companies that are rolling out product lines to attract the cash-conscious millennial. It now has 20 Moxy hotels around the world and plans to open 90 more by the end of 2021. Millennials, broadly defined as those born in the last two decades of last century, have, as a group, tended to put more emphasis on experiences. And this has become a challenge for businesses. “The Kardashians paint a false picture of millennials,” said Joan Kuhl, founder and president of Why Millennials Matter, a New York research agency. “I don’t see this group with a lavish affluent lifestyle.” Millennials, many of whom saw their parents struggle with jobs and mortgages during the recession, generally have less interest in buying the big house, flashy sports car and designer clothing that previous generations sought as status symbols of success. Nevertheless, they will pay for the right experiences and technology. “It’s where you go on vacation, what you do and what technology you have,” said Allen Adamson, one of the founders and managing partners of Metaforce, a brand marketing and consulting firm, and one of the authors of “Shift Ahead: How The Best Companies Stay Relevant in a Fast Changing World.” Those experiences need to be “Instagram-worthy,” too. The quirkier, flashier and more offbeat the experience, the better, he said. And businesses are catching on. IMAX, for instance, rolled out six virtual reality theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Manchester and Toronto over the last year as a pilot project to attract millennials. And it has plans to open four more. IMAX charges roughly $10 for a 10-minute VR experience, which is far cheaper than the $1,500 or more needed to buy an in-home VR technology system with a high-end PC and headset. A visitor steps into a pod, snaps on a VR headset and is virtually transported on a 360-degree journey that can include flying over volcanoes, diving into the world of criminals and hit men from the John Wick films, or stepping into the shoes of virtual game superheroes like Batman and Wonder Woman. Afterward, the players receive a video of their VR experience, which they can share with friends on social media. “Millennials want really special experiences and ones that are hard to replicate,” said Rich Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX. When it comes to automobiles, many millennials don’t care about high-end cars the way that previous generations did, but they do want the in-cabin technology and luxury features that often go with them, said Sam Russell, Buick’s marketing director. So Buick started marketing the brand as “attainable luxury” to attract younger buyers, and it added features normally seen in cars like Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and BMW to many of its models in recent years, like 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay and Ionizer air purifiers. As for the Moxy, its very existence is aimed at millennials. “We’re delivering a killer experience at a price point that’s affordable,” said Toni Stoeckl, global brand leader of Marriott’s Distinctive Select Brands. To keep rates down, Moxy’s rooms are tiny, averaging only 183 square feet. But its lounges, bars and public spaces are large and encourage a social atmosphere, where guests can mingle and even play board games with friends and strangers. Guests check in electronically through their phones or through the hotel bar instead of at a front desk. There are special events, like midnight pajama parties, where guests are invited to the bar for a nightcap, as well as yoga classes, tarot card readings and “ConBody” events, where ex-convicts lead prison-style boot-camp fitness classes. At the Moxy Times Square, a neon-pink light marks the entryway and art graces the ceiling and walls. And its five rooftop dining and nightclub spaces, operated by the Tao Group, contain a rotating carousel bar and outdoor mini-golf course with a clear view of the Empire State Building. “It’s funky and quite quirky,” said Karl Fegredo, 27, from London, who recently stayed at the hotel. Even Moxy’s hotel openings are edgy and memorable. At the Moxy New Orleans party, snake charmers, tarot card readers and sword swallowers took part in its “Freak Show” theme. The Berlin Moxy “coming out” party featured drag queens, dominatrixes and tattoo artists as part of an S.&M. theme. “Moxy is about transforming yourself in a playful environment,” Mr. Stoeckl said. Many brands hope that by capturing millennials now, they can turn them into lifelong customers. “I think everybody understands they really need to home in on millennials,” Mr. Gelfond said, “if they want to create a successful long-term business.”",5438
5a98c59a410cf7000162eca0,2018-03-02T03:31:21+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/arts/television/atlanta-season-2-premiere-recap.html,Culture,"In the sublimely odd first season of “Atlanta,” Donald Glover and his crew of creatives trained us to expect the unexpected — whether it’s a local celebrity stunting in an invisible car, an ominous bus passenger aggressively pushing a Nutella sandwich, or a random Migos cameo. The Season 2 premiere’s opening nails the dark comedy’s signature unpredictability factor, but offers up zero chuckles, off-kilter or otherwise. Instead, it socks viewers with the kind of sobering grittiness you’d expect from an episode of “The Wire.” It all starts benignly enough, with a pair of anonymous teens trash talking over sports drinks and video games. Cut to those same teens getting away with armed robbery. A fast-food restaurant is riddled with bullets after a high-octane shootout, a bloody teenage girl is howling in terror, and there’s no explanation for the breakneck escalation of events other than this: It’s robbin’ season. “Christmas approaches and everybody gotta eat,” Darius muses, summing up the recent uptick in neighborhood crime. Just like that, a sense of foreboding seeps in. While the city braces for a surge in random violence, Earn comes face-to-face with a chilling future version of himself. And nobody seems to be doing much to prevent either oncoming tragedy. Last season, Alfred (a.k.a. “Paper Boi”) stumbled toward rap relevancy while cousin Earn shrugged his way into a music manager role. They both fell haphazardly into modest fame — by way of notoriety — and it seemed possible that they’d return to show off a little bit this time around. Instead, we find them stuck on the same sofas, cruising the same struggling streets and hamstrung by the same old obstacles (rap sheets and general inertia). The only thing that’s changed is Earn’s kick-the-can approach to lodging has resulted in yet another bout of homelessness. He’s been booted from his storage unit squat and can’t even find refuge at his cousin’s condo. As for Al and Darius, the roommates have bad blood brewing and no one will speak on it. Darius is the show’s lone reliable source of levity, so when things aren’t buzzing harmoniously on his weirdo astral plane, morale is low overall. He keeps the episode’s eerie tone going when he pivoted from discussing the everyday horrors of area crime sprees to sharing the urban legend of “Florida Man.” Earn laughs off Darius’s accounts of the white boogeyman, a goof on the meme inspired by the state’s penchant for insane headlines. But the director Hiro Murai gives the tale a dark folkloric edge that raises goose bumps. All this bad mojo was leading up to the big showdown between Earn and his uncle Willy. Al, who’s stuck at home on house arrest, tasked Earn with peacekeeping duties when he got word that Willy was holding a woman against her will. Played by comedian Katt Williams (who’s no stranger to legal drama), Willy’s the bitter, combative relative most of us have and would just as soon avoid. He’s a robe-sporting, chain smoking, venom-spewing cautionary tale for Earn. Willy’s outworn his use to those around him, but he’s still living off Al’s handouts, in a house that Al’s paying for. Darius was right when he pulled up to the house and sensed that the vibes there were “just so intense.” A dispute over $50 led to a low-key hostage situation. Oh, and while Willy’s girlfriend is locked up in one room, there’s a live alligator inexplicably locked in another. (Neighborhood kids call Willy “Alligator Man,” dropping the episode title.) With the police waiting at the door and tensions running high, Earn and Willy get into a heated discussion. “You scared,” Willy reasons. “You gotta stay on [Al’s] good side now, ’cause he’s Mr. Money Bags. I remember Uncle Jarvis used to manage Damon when he was in that group. Now, they don’t even talk no more, ’cause you find out family is business.” No, Earn spits back, what he’s actually scared of is turning into Willy, a guy who wasted his shot and is now just a know-it-all screw-up who just lets life happen to him. So far, most signs point to this being Earn’s destiny. He’s been floating through life, wincing and sighing as his housing prospects dwindle, his criminal record racks up points and his past Ivy League laurels fade into irrelevance. He seems to feel he’s above it all, even as he’s drowning in it. Willy’s final word of advice was simple and on point: “If you don’t wanna end up like me, get rid of that chip-on-your-shoulder … It’s not worth the time.” With nothing left to say, Earn agrees to hide his uncle’s contraband golden gun from the cops and figured his de-escalating work there was done. But instead of Willy’s expected surrender to the cops, we get that signature left-field element we’d been waiting for in the form of the aforementioned reptile. To paraphrase legendary local lyricist Big Boi, “while the gator’s creeping, crawling, oh so wicked” out the front door, the cops are too distracted to notice Willy making a hasty backdoor escape in his robe and houseshoes. Though he’s clearly doomed, it’s hard not to wish him well. Because if there’s hope for him, there may be hope for Earn, too. The writers returned from their protracted break offering up more questions than answers. It’s not clear how much time has transpired since we last left the core trio. No one knows why Darius and Al have beef at the top of the episode. Who are Uncle Jarvis and Damon, and what did Willy do to Earn’s mom that’s left him carrying a grudge? Will the teens in the opening robbery be relevant down the road? But while you may leave the episode feeling fuzzy about back stories and unsure of whether certain characters will pop up again , you do at least have a clearer understanding of just why Earn’s wary parents don’t let him cross their threshold. It’s because they’ve already seen the blueprint for what he’s becoming. You also see that Darius and Al share that kind of tight-knit bond that allows friends to be unspeakably angry one day, then seamlessly in sync the next. These new layers offer clues as to how these three will progress (or regress, as the case may be) going forward. • Darius is back in his chicken-printed apron again. But this time, his sour mood has affected his cooking: He’s left plating unappetizing sliders. ”Be careful. It’s very, very cold.” • Earn, in an attempt to help Alfred and Darius squash their mysterious beef, sincerely tells them he loves them both. He’s then roasted mercilessly because, apparently in their world, there’s no funnier punch line than a man showing vulnerability and expressing his feelings. • Earn to Darius: “What flavor is a Flamin’ Hot Cheeto?” Darius shrugs: “Hot.” Earn samples another: “I am tasting ‘hot.’” Though hilarious in its inanity, this little exchange is juxtaposed with the sights and sounds of a crime scene just across the street. • Uncle Willy, despite being accused of kidnapping a woman, insists that Earn and Darius take off their shoes before entering his house. • “Looks like an Azealia Banks Snapchat,” Darius says, upon looking in on Willy’s alligator to find it surrounded by chicken carcasses. (It’s a rather obscure reference to the rapper-singer’s 2016 video confession about her witchcraft ways.) • The lyrics to Curtis Mayfield’s “When Seasons Change” — which played the episode into the closing credits — read like an outline of everything we just watched (“Time makes you suffer when seasons change/Can’t call no names when you got your own self to blame”).",7473

The numbers, announced on a conference call by Tad Smith, the president of Sotheby’s, mark an improvement from the $65.5 million earned in the same quarter last year. The adjusted net income for the full year increased to $121.7 million, up from $99.6 million in 2016. “There’s more optimism,” David Schick, the director of research and lead luxury analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said. “This is an old brand that’s bringing a lot of new business practices. Some of those initiatives are starting to bear fruit.” While the art world entered 2017 with constricting markets and anxiety about how the Trump administration would affect American and international sales, markets have largely recovered and are once again bullish. Sotheby’s saw success this year in its efforts to diversify its ventures, including into private sales, financial services, and watches and jewelry. Private sales, in particular, were strong this year, growing by 28 percent to $744.6 million. “Sotheby’s has been a business model focused on auctions,” Mr. Schick said. “But growing private sales allows you to be open every day.” The auction house benefited slightly from President Trump’s tax overhaul — which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent — as well as holding cash abroad. “We will be bringing in the range of $325 million of cash back from our overseas operations at a significantly lower tax rate than we had previously planned,” Mike Goss, Sotheby’s chief financial officer, said in a statement. Throughout the year, Sotheby’s auctions with big names resulted in huge sales: A Basquiat set a record by selling for $110.5 million in May, while a Chagall sold for $28.5 million in November. “We intend to stay the course and continue what we’re doing both strategically and financially,” Mr. Goss said.",1974
5a9852b0410cf7000162eb6d,2018-03-01T19:21:12+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/arts/music/best-jazz-dave-douglas-amirtha-kidambi.html,Culture,"Welcome to “The Month in Live Jazz,” a column highlighting five standout performances from the past month on stages across New York City. DAVE DOUGLAS Jazz at Lincoln Center, Feb. 24 It’s always been convenient to frame the trumpeter Dave Douglas as an anti-traditionalist, but he’s more of a roving archaeologist, exhuming and examining various strands of musical history without declaring any singular allegiance. On Saturday at the Appel Room, he led an intergenerational sextet in an investigation of Dizzy Gillespie’s legacy. The set included both deconstructions of Gillespie’s repertoire and Douglas originals inspired by his famed trumpet forebear. In “Manteca,” Gillespie’s seminal Latin-jazz composition, Ambrose Akinmusire, playing second trumpet, made the strongest statement. His brief solo was a saber stream of bluesy invocation, loud and wide-awake. (Douglas’s arrangements didn’t allow for many long-form solos, a revision to the bebop idiom that emphasized both the arrangement and the ensemble’s spontaneous interplay.) As the tune simmered toward senescence, Mr. Akinmusire, 35, used circular breathing to hold a long tone while the guitarist Bill Frisell responded with gentle, sustained notes in the upper register. The drummer Joey Baron scraped tones off the surfaces of his cymbals, and Mr. Akinmusire started making blustery smacks into his mouthpiece. Then he pulled it out and clacked it around in the bell of the horn. The audience was laughing some, but it was bewildered too. There was Gillespie’s legacy for you: an entertainer who could entwine gravitas and levity, an ambassador for the younger generation’s attitudes, frustrations and will toward self-representation. Dave Douglas performs at the Village Vanguard with Joe Lovano from June 12-17. DAVID MURRAY INFINITY QUARTET Birdland, Feb. 1 The tenor saxophonist David Murray’s new album, “Blues for Memo,” is centered on the emphatic poetry of Saul Williams. It works as a sharp inoculation against establishment wisdom, delivered in the guise of a blues-battered jazz recording. Mr. Murray, 63, an outré jazz eminence who recently moved back to New York after years of living in Europe, is no stranger to literary collaborations, or to bending the rules of straight-ahead jazz to suit his idiosyncrasies. His thick tone — with a tremulous vibrato and a constant urge to scrape its way higher into the atmosphere — sounds like the synthesis of a jazz broad tradition, and also like no other musician. Mr. Murray played a week at Birdland recently, joined by his quartet but not Mr. Williams. Even without the poetry, the group made its points clear. Mr. Murray rendered Billy Strayhorn’s ballad “Chelsea Bridge” without any undue sentimentality, checking his tremolo just a bit. And on original tunes from the album, the drummer Nasheet Waits played in his brawny, aerated style, matching Mr. Murray’s warped pronouncements and rough urgency. The David Murray Infinity Quartet’s latest album, “Blues for Memo,” featuring the poet Saul Williams, is out on Motéma Records. AMIRTHA KIDAMBI Roulette, Feb. 27 Sometimes the eye of a storm can draw upon the chaos around it, taking on its energy and consolidating it for use. Something like that is going on in Elder Ones, the quartet led by the vocalist and harmonium player Amirtha Kidambi. She creates drones on the harmonium — an old, air-powered keyboard — and coaxes her bandmates into ripping them apart. Then she funnels that energy out in a scorching beam. In its best moments, it’s like a mix of a Cuban sonero’s citrusy cry and a riot grrrl yowl. At Roulette, Ms. Kidambi performed a book of new material with Elder Ones — featuring Matt Nelson on soprano saxophone, Nick Dunston on bass and Max Jaffe on drums — which released a strong CD, “Holy Science,” in 2016. The band abided by a turbulent pact, Mr. Nelson painting in vertical streaks as the rhythm section pried at its own foundations. Ms. Kidambi also performed a solo set, accompanying her voice with belled bangles on her ankles (the ghungroo, a traditional Indian accouterment) and, for the latter half of each piece, the harmonium. The songs, comprising a new suite she’s calling “Yajna” (or “ritual of fire”), all centered on direct phrases: “They step on those beneath in the name of progress,” or, in one inspired by the life and death of Erica Garner, “The system breaks her heart.” Without the tousled kinetics of the band, Ms. Kidambi worked hard to create a full context. To a degree, the specificity and the fury felt healthy, and important. We need more of this. But the lyrics were intentionally unambiguous, leaving little room for imagination. And in the way she hurtled them straight and hard at the audience, you couldn’t help feeling as if you were receiving something impervious and final. It was hard to tap into a sense of catharsis, or find your way into the sound. As she develops these pieces, Ms. Kidambi may work to ensure that her solo music feels more like a caldron of activity and possibility — frightening listeners and beckoning them at the same time — like her music with Elder Ones often does. Ms. Kidambi continues her residency at Roulette on June 17, performing in a vocal quintet and a duo with the saxophonist Lea Bertucci. FOUR SIMULTANEOUS SOLOISTS Pioneer Works, Feb. 2 In the main gallery at Pioneer Works in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in an exhibition titled “Solid Light Works,” the artist Anthony McCall has four vertical light sculptures on display. In an almost pitch-black room, the pearly drapes of light descend from a high ceiling in irregular, conical shapes, making stark outlines on the black carpet. Each immaterial sculpture has a distinct allure and form, but as you walk under and through them, their effects become related. Your eyes adjust and readjust; your body enters into the light; your movement throughout the space connects the four pieces. A similar logic took hold on Feb. 2 as you listened to the music in the second of four performances titled “Four Simultaneous Soloists.” In the gallery, the pedal steel guitarist Susan Alcorn, the drummer Eli Keszler, the cellist Tomeka Reid and the trumpeter Nate Wooley each sat beside one of the four vertical light sculptures, improvising freely as attendees circled slowly around them or sat beneath the fallen lights. Couples found it hard not to embrace or lay down together in an unselfconscious tangle. The “soloists” played quietly, matching the darkness around them, and they could only catch snatches and inklings of what the others were playing. Ms. Alcorn and Mr. Keszler were at opposite ends of the long gallery; whatever information they received from each other came almost completely through Ms. Reid and Mr. Wooley. Thinking it through, you might have been drawn to wander. Why sit and hear Ms. Alcorn’s simple, slowly exhaled harmonies when across the room Mr. Wooley was playing fabulous long tones, blowing into what looked like a sheet of metal and making a music of blistery reconstitution? But ultimately, your body won out. It wanted you to find an arbitrary vantage and sit still, allowing the shape of the room and the vague drift of sound to determine what you heard. The final Four Simultaneous Soloists performance takes place on Friday, featuring Jules Gimbrone playing objects and electronics, Okkyung Lee on cello, Chris McIntyre on trombone and synthesizer, and Yoshi Wada on bagpipes and sirens. ANAT FORT QUARTET Cornelia Street Café, Feb. 20 Most of the tunes that the Anat Fort Quartet played at Cornelia Street Café last week came from the group’s most recent album on ECM Records, “Birdwatching.” But something new emerged. On the album, Ms. Fort draws elliptical harmonies around the clarinet sound of Gianluigi Trovesi, a distant and ephemeral player. But at Cornelia, her sparring partner was the alto saxophonist Michael Attias, and the pair drove each other into a flintier exchange. Midway through “Song of the Phoenix,” Ms. Fort took a solo in the low-middle range that had a kind of generative fury, body and fire united. Then, on a freshly composed Fort original, provisionally titled “Sort Of,” Mr. Attias took a solo that exhibited his roughly chiseled attack, answering Ms. Fort’s provocation. Even the lovely or dreamlike moments had a sense of hard-won embodiment and purpose. That tune was followed by “Murmuration,” from the album. As Mr. Attias’s solo neared its summit, Ms. Fort drove her rhythm section — the bassist Gary Wang and the drummer Rudy Royston — toward a splintered dissolution. Her chords had the bright payoff of internal octaves as well as the acrid carp of dissonance. Altogether, the group was finding a new cooperative language, sometimes hitting a sputtering stride, sometimes avoiding cohesion altogether. The Anat Fort Quartet returns to the Cornelia Street Café on April 13.",8864

Though it is Ms. Varda’s first Oscar nomination, she has been a mainstay of film coverage in The New York Times for six decades. Her earliest appearance in the Times was in 1958, in a list of winners from the Brussels International Film Festival screening in New York. Ms. Varda was profiled in 1966 and has appeared regularly in the Times since. Here are some highlights from The Times’s coverage of her career. After the release of her film “Le Bonheur,” which won a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, Ms. Varda was interviewed by the film writer Howard Thompson. Ms. Varda called herself “the feminine New Wave,” and Mr. Thompson noted that she was “one of the few female writer-directors in the world.” The director Alain Resnais, who edited Ms. Varda’s first film, “La Pointe Courte,” credited her with “heralding all the gathering forces of the oncoming New Wave.” Ms. Varda was profiled by Flora Lewis after her film “One Sings, the Other Doesn’t” was selected to open the New York Film Festival in 1977. At the festival, Ms. Varda introduced her movie by proclaiming that the attendees were going to see “a film about women who were also people.” Ms. Varda discussed gender imbalance in movies. “Is there such a thing as a woman’s film, of special interest to women? We have to see, they haven’t had any choice,” she said. Ms. Varda wanted to portray female relationships on film. “There are always stories about virile male friendships, Brando and Nicholson, Newman and Redford and so on, but not about friendship between women. The women are always motherly or tarty.” Ms. Varda’s film “Vagabond” won the Golden Lion at the 1985 Venice Film Festival, making her the second female director to receive the prize. Annette Insdorf noted that the film had “little in common with the Parisian farces, American blockbusters and urban thrillers that dominated the French box office.” Ms. Varda said she wanted to “make a film about the real France — not Parisian intellectuals — the France that is completely ignored in contemporary cinema.” The film’s star, Sandrine Bonnaire, had become “one of the most sought-after screen artists in her country.” Ms. Varda said she sold Ms. Bonnaire on the film by telling her that the character would be “alone, dirty and rebellious, and she dies of the cold. Miss Bonnaire was delighted.” The Museum of Modern Art screened all of Ms. Varda’s films in a retrospective of her work in 1997. When Mel Gussow spoke to Ms. Varda about the tribute, she said, “At least it doesn’t say posthume.” The story describes her point of view on the art of filmmaking, including her case for the auteur theory. “Auteurs are much attacked nowadays because people say they are selfish and narcissistic, that they don’t want to listen to anybody. It’s true — and so what?” She also speaks to her origins as a feminist. “I think I was a feminist before being born. I had a feminist chromosome somewhere.” She describes hating Snow White as a child. “ I could see she was behaving stupidly, cleaning the dishes, brooming everything for these monsters. It was ridiculous — and waiting for the ugly prince.” Ms. Varda spoke to Leslie Camhi in 2001 about her inspiration for the film “The Gleaners and I,” which focused on people who live off the garbage thrown out by others. Ms. Varda told Ms. Camhi the film was “about an ill society, that does a poor job of sharing its bounty — but the very people who are living through that difficulty point the finger and teach us about it.” Ms. Camhi tied “The Gleaners and I” to the socially conscious themes of Ms. Varda’s other work and detailed her legacy, including how Ms. Varda, then 72, was crowned “the ancestor of the New Wave” at the age of 30. “I’m like those old painters who don’t bother to make sketches or ask permissions. They don’t give explanations. They just go ahead and do it,” Ms. Varda said, reflecting on “Gleaners,” which she also produced. The Times co-chief film critic A. O. Scott spoke to Ms. Varda about her documentary “The Beaches of Agnès.” The film “is a cinematic memoir in two senses,” Mr. Scott wrote. “An autobiography rendered in carefully chosen, meaning-rich images and the account of a life lived in, through and for cinema.” “I am the queen of the margins, but the films are loved. The films are remembered,” Ms. Varda said of her career. “And this is my aim — to be loved as a filmmaker because I want to share emotions, to share the pleasure of being a filmmaker.” Ms. Varda’s Oscar-nominated “Faces Places” was a Times Critic’s Pick, and both chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and Mr. Scott, named it one of the best films of the year. “Contemplating some of the sorrows in her own past and the precariousness of the European present, she keeps gloom at bay with her resilient faith in the power of art to conserve and expand human dignity,” Mr. Scott said. “Every second of this movie proves her right.” Ms. Dargis takes it a step further. “Ms. Varda is often described as one of the greatest female directors alive, which is true. She is also one of the greatest.”",5375

Trump’s America. But as was demonstrated last year by her acclaimed “Cost of Living,” a cleareyed portrait of two prickly souls with severe physical disabilities, Ms. Majok doesn’t host pity parties.

This landmark work should initiate plenty of heated conversation about gay identity, political engagement, bad faith and the role of theater itself.

5a979b56410cf7000162e941,2018-03-01T06:18:52+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/theater/1968-munich-liberte-volksbuehne.html,Culture,"MUNICH — “We all want to change the world,” the Beatles sang on “The White Album,” released in 1968. Half a century later, the legacy of ’68, its hopes, its dreams and whether it achieved its goals, are still up for debate, here in Germany as in America. Jörg Meuthen, one of the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, recently insisted that the country must change its “filthy” and “morally rotten” course, forged by the generation of left-wingers who came of age in that year of upheavals. The conservative denunciation of the student movement, the peace movement, civil rights and the sexual revolution provides the impetus for an ambitious new theatrical production that explores the contemporary meaning of ’68. Billed as “an occupation” of the Münchner Kammerspiele theater, “1968” is a wild, uneven but often thought-provoking series of eight 15-minute vignettes, conceived and performed by different artists and theater collectives. The Berlin-based architecture group Raumlabor has transformed the Kammerspiele’s main theater into something resembling a university lecture theater, with the audience invited to sit pretty much anywhere it pleases. The stage is set, so to speak, for an immersive evening. Two hippies preach “love instead of rockets” in the opening segment, by the director Leonie Böhm. Three magnetic performers in the German-Ivorian group Gintersdorfer/Klassen proclaim the theories of the post-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon. The director Henrike Iglesias uses a flashy game show format to encourage participation in a discussion about feminism. As the evening wears on, ushers hand out beer in plastic cups. For all its efforts to involve the audience, however, “1968” often feels too didactic by half. I went in expecting a riotous and frustrating combination of theory, art and political advocacy à la Jean-Luc Godard’s most freewheeling and radical work from that era. The format of short performances is a safeguard against monotony, and the performers are nothing if not committed, but all together, “1968” lacks a degree of exuberant conviction. The entire undertaking has more than a tinge of nostalgia, too. All but one of the performers were born after 1968; watching their contributions, it’s hard not to feel their yearning for a time when radical thought and action went hand-in-hand, because young people believed that they really could change the world. “I don’t want to recreate 1968. But we can learn a lot from the 68ers. We can learn how to fail,” the theater director and performance artist Christoph Schlingensief once said. The quote appears in “Partisan,” a documentary about Berlin’s Volksbühne theater under the quarter-century reign of its artistic director Frank Castorf that was a standout title in this year’s Berlin Film Festival, which wrapped up last weekend. From 1992, Mr. Castorf deployed his radical, immersive and demanding theatrical approach at the Volksbühne as a counterweight to what he and many other East Germans saw as the conformity and false optimism of the reunified Germany. As an envelope-pushing provocateur, he hit on a recipe for success, turning the Volksbühne into ground zero for avant-garde theatrical practices. Admired and reviled, praised and denounced, Mr. Castorf’s Volksbühne was never a theater one could remain indifferent to. In 2015, the announcement of the former Tate Modern director Chris Dercon as successor to Mr. Castorf set off waves of protest. Many feared that Mr. Dercon would transform the theater into a posh venue for international artists, with no connection to the city of Berlin or the people who live there. After a fall program that included productions from the French choreographer Boris Charmatz, a version of “Iphigenia” featuring Syrian refugees and a trippy immersive installation from the Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul, the most ambitious dramatic production of Mr. Dercon’s still-young tenure arrived in February: a world premiere written and directed by the Catalan filmmaker Albert Serra. The work, “Liberté,” centers on a group of French nobles seeking to spread the ideals of “libertinage” at the Prussian court shortly before the French Revolution. In propagating the radical and unbridled pursuit of erotic pleasure against all social, religious and moral restraints, the licentious aristocrats seek to establish a sexual utopia that challenges the prevailing forces of the Enlightenment. The French title invites us to reflect on the meaning of freedom, and whether the libertines are out to liberate humanity from its shackles or merely seek to enslave it to its desires. Mr. Serra has managed to coax two legendary European actors out of retirement for the production: 79-year-old Ingrid Caven, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s wife and muse, plays an exiled French duchess and notorious libertine, and 73-year-old Helmut Berger, who appeared in several of Luchino Visconti’s films, takes the role of a freethinking German duke. But despite the big names attached, “Liberté” is a resounding failure. Mr. Serra’s choice to set the entire 150-minute play in a secluded field populated with aristocrats who rarely leave their ornate sedan chairs produces the theatrical equivalent of rigor mortis. From the fourth row, I had a hard time making out what was happening in the large, murkily lit set, or in the mysterious Mr. Berger’s broken-down coach in a corner of the stage. The first 40 minutes or so, while the Duchess and her retinue return to the field time and again in the hopes of meeting an Italian count with connections at the Prussian court, are especially rough. It can feel like a version of “Waiting for Godot” with dialogue by the Marquis de Sade. Once the count materialized, things got only moderately more stimulating. A subplot involving two novices at a local convent whom the French seek to debauch starts out promisingly, yet, like everything else in the play, leads nowhere. And in what sort of play about libertinage do you have to wait 90 minutes for a decent flogging? In “Liberté,” Mr. Serra’s sensibilities are ill-served by his static and airless direction. As in his most recent film, “The Death of Louis XIV” (2016), the attention to historical detail is exacting. But why these laboriously made-up actors languish in their toll booth-like sedans is a mystery. Many directors before him, including Mr. Castorf, have used video to amplify or even reveal aspects of a production that would otherwise be invisible. There is much gratuitous use of video in German theater productions at the moment, but when used wisely, it can greatly enrich the dramatic experience. In the case of “Liberté,” a few close-ups now and again would certainly have helped the plodding evening along. Mr. Serra might consider turning to the Swiss director Milo Rau for inspiration. In “Lenin,” over at the Schaubühne, Mr. Rau masterfully employs video in a grim and claustrophobic dramatization of the Soviet leader’s final days in 1924 at his dacha outside Moscow. Like Katie Mitchell, another director who frequently works at this bold ensemble theater, Mr. Rau films and seamlessly edits the production in real time, providing a parallel visual track of expressive cinematic images that add interpretive layers. Our eyes constantly dart from the live actors before our eyes to the screen on which they appear, larger than life, from multiple camera angles and occasionally in black and white. Marking the centenary of the Russian Revolution and starring the remarkable Ursina Lardi in the title role, “Lenin” examines the legacy of that pivotal world event from the vantage point of its incapacitated leader and from the perspective of a world that had yet to experience the greatest horrors of the 20th century. “You say you want a revolution,” all these plays all seem to agree: Just don’t expect it to bring about the promised utopia.",7894

And maybe there was a chance, but … I get the feeling you don’t have many great nights with people — am I right? So when you do, it feels huge, it feels life-changing.” It is intended to be a gentle letdown — one that Andrew, of course, can’t or won’t accept. It is also a reminder that this series is about failures of recognition: not only failures to recognize gay lives, worth and dignity, but also failures of self-recognition. After my last recap, in which I lamented this show’s failure to offer a compelling explanation for Andrew Cunanan’s homicidal rampage, some readers faulted me for seeking a motivation, much less redemption, where none can be found. One reader, Toni from Maine, argues: That succinct hypothesis is very much supported by this episode (brava, Toni!), in which Cunanan’s dismal career as a rent boy, his failure to attract men his own age and his jealous rage are examined in considerable detail. I’ve come to accept that origin-of-evil questions are outside the scope of “American Crime Story.” But that acceptance doesn’t make this unrelenting portrait of pathology any easier to absorb. The episode begins in 1996 — a year before the murders — at the spacious San Diego villa of Norman Blachford, a sixtysomething businessman who, after losing a partner to AIDS, became Andrew’s sugar daddy. In exchange for free housing, a luxury car and a monthly housing allowance, Andrew gives Norman advice on acquiring art and antiquities, and occasional sex. Norman also throws Andrew a birthday party, to which Andrew invites the object of his infatuation, David. To impress him, Andrew asks his friend Jeff to impersonate the naval officer he used to be and to present Andrew with a gift of Ferragamo shoes — as a sign, Andrew says, that he is loved. (Jeff agrees, grudgingly, to present the gift but not to dress up.) The stunt backfires: Jeff and David take an immediate interest in each other, but not so much in Andrew. And we know from a previous episode that they will end up getting together, which Andrew discovers before killing them both. Andrew’s pathologies are apparent to anyone who bothers to look. Norman’s protective friend Gallo spots Andrew snorting drugs and confronts him. “You think Norman’s the lucky one, don’t you?” he says. “But you’re wrong: You’re the lucky one.” Andrew is only able to parade himself around like an equal because Norman, who has built an immensely successful company from scratch, is generous enough to want Andrew to feel that way. When Andrew insists that he is Norman’s equal and then tries to storm off, Gallo delivers the bons mots that will prove to be an unfortunate understatement: “What a volatile mix you are: too lazy to work and too proud to be kept.” That mismatch between Andrew’s laziness and ambition comes to the forefront when he presents Norman with an ultimatum: He demands a higher living allowance; first-class flights; a Mercedes-Benz XL600; and a place in Norman’s will, as his sole heir. Norman refuses. He has performed some “due diligence,” he says, and has learned that Andrew is not Andrew DeSilva, Ph.D., the estranged son of New York millionaires, but Andrew Cunanan, college dropout, who was recently working at a Thrifty drugstore for $6.16 an hour and living in a cramped condo with his mother, MaryAnn. It is an extraordinary scene. Confronted with the truth, Andrew remains in denial. When it becomes clear Norman won’t relent, Andrew grabs a patio chair and smashes a glass tabletop with it — a mere hint at the serious violence to come. Andrew’s aggression also extends toward Jeff, whom he suspects of trying to steal away David, particularly after Jeff says that he is leaving San Diego to move to Minneapolis, where David lives. Ever in denial, Andrew persuades David to fly to Los Angeles, where Andrew has reserved a room at a five-star hotel and buys David an expensive suit. Andrew can’t stop lying — asked what he does for a living, he suggests that he is financing a major movie — and the dinner culminates in excruciating fashion with Andrew declaring, “David Madson, you are the only one I have ever really truly loved.” David, the industrious son of a Wisconsin hardware-store owner, gives Andrew what amounts to a final chance, asking simply for the truth. Andrew still can’t stop his prevarications. He says his father was a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch who later returned to the Philippines “to run vast pineapple plantations”; that his mother oversaw a literary publishing house until she retired; and that his parents adored him so much that they lavished little Andrew with the master bedroom, a credit card and an occasional lobster when the school lunch wasn’t good enough. Andrew seems unaware that high-achieving people from modest backgrounds tend not to be impressed by tales of pampered childhoods. In the remainder of the episode, we learn more about Andrew’s drugs and dreams. (Maureen Orth’s book “Vulgar Favors,” upon which the series is based, says that Andrew was a drug dealer, not just a drug user.) In one bizarre scene, Andrew dreams that he has walked into a Versace boutique and is being measured for a suit by the designer himself. His self-indulgent lament: The fantasy Versace replies, more than a tad sardonically, “That is very poetic, sir.” Andrew tells him: “This world has wasted me. It has wasted me while it has turned you, Mr. Versace, into a star.” Andrew adds: “We’re the same. The only difference is you got lucky.” Consumed by self-pity, delusion and addiction, Andrew hits bottom. He returns to Norman’s mansion, desperate for money; Norman threatens to call the police. Finally Andrew goes home — to his mother’s dingy apartment. MaryAnn seems, if such a thing is possible, even more deluded than her son.

The concert series will start Sept. 13 at the Rose Theater with a performance of “Spaces,” a broadly accessible work composed by the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, the organization’s artistic director, as a homage to the animal kingdom. The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra will perform the suite in conversation with the contemporary dancers Lil Buck and Jared Grimes. Subsequent concerts by the orchestra will focus on the songbooks of Thelonious Monk (Oct. 25-27) and Miles Davis (Nov. 8-10). Other major shows will also pay tribute to departed jazz luminaries, in keeping with Jazz at Lincoln Center tradition. On Dec. 14-15, the vocalist Sachal Vasandani will present a program celebrating the 100th birthday of Nat King Cole. A conclave of eminent pianists — including Gerald Clayton, Gonzalo Rubalcaba and Kenny Barron, a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master — will perform a concert on Feb. 22-23, 2019, dedicated to the repertoire of Oscar Peterson. And on March 29-30, the bassist Marcus Miller will offer a tribute to Davis, his former employer, entitled “Electric Miles.” The season will include some concerts exploring parallel music traditions, including “Jazz, Bluegrass and Folk,” on Oct. 5-6, featuring the violinist Mark O’Connor and his ensemble; “Music from Appalachia,” on Dec. 7-8, headlined by the singer-songwriters Steve Miller and Marty Stuart; and “Country Music,” on April 25-27, in which the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra will share the stage with the documentarian Ken Burns. And audiences will have ample opportunity to hear from throwback jazz vocalists. Diane Schuur will sing music from the Count Basie Orchestra’s repertoire on Nov. 2-3. And Michael Feinstein will present three different programs, one dedicated to the music of Peter Allen (April 10-11), another titled “Great American Crooners” (May 15-16), and the last focused on the songwriting team Lerner and Loewe (June 5-6).

Mr. Coates, a longtime comics fan who began creating them a little more than two years ago, announced the news in The Atlantic, for which he is a national correspondent. He described his vision of the character and laid out his plans for addressing what he confessed he saw as an artistic challenge. “Nothing should really scare a writer more than the moment when they are no longer scared,” he wrote. ""I’m not convinced I can tell a great Captain America story — which is precisely why I want so bad to try.” The writer has previously worked on Black Panther, reinvigorating the title two years before the movie based on the character became a blockbuster success. The comic sold briskly while in his hands, and one collection, Black Panther, Volume 1: A Nation Under Our Feet, was nominated for a Hugo Award in 2017. But Mr. Coates has not had unbridled success in comics: His spinoff series, Black Panther & the Crew, was canceled in May after it failed to sell as well as expected. Mr. Coates, who is widely known for his reporting and commentary on race, brought his experience with nonfiction to bear as he was writing Black Panther, taking on politics and culture in the fictional African nation of Wakanda, where the series is set. He challenged the kingdom’s monarchical tradition, introduced an insurgency and questioned the Wakandan religion. In contrast with Black Panther, Captain America is one of the oldest and best-known characters in the Marvel universe. He first appeared during World War II and is often seen as the ultimate patriot, a man dedicated to the ideals of his country and willing to fight for them no matter what. But as Mr. Coates outlined in his announcement, Captain America, who was born Steve Rogers and is frequently referred to simply as Cap, often has an uneasy relationship with the American government. He is a more nuanced character than his film analogue, played by the actor Chris Evans, might suggest. For 15 months, starting in May 2016, the comic character was somehow the evil leader of Hydra, an organization reminiscent of the Nazis. This could make the character an interesting match for Mr. Coates, who throughout his career has written about his complicated relationship with and views about patriotism, and has often been accused of being pessimistic about the United States’ future. In a 2016 profile of President Barack Obama, he wrote that what separated Mr. Obama from many African-Americans (including, it was implied, himself) was the ability to trust “white America.” Mr. Coates will join a small number of black writers who have taken on the character, including Christopher Priest, who worked on the series Captain America and the Falcon in 2004 and 2005. “Finding the right voice to tell the tales of Marvel’s beloved characters is never an easy task, but when it came time to hire the new hand to guide Captain America, we just knew it had to be Ta-Nehisi Coates,” Marvel’s chief editor, C. B. Cebulski, said in a statement. “After re-inventing the Black Panther for the modern era, Ta-Nehisi now brings his sharp scripting sensibilities to Steve Rogers and his new place in the Marvel Universe.” In his Captain America announcement, Mr. Coates said writing the character, the embodiment of the optimism expressed in the American dream, would allow him to challenge himself. “What is exciting here is not some didactic act of putting my words in Captain America’s head, but attempting to put Captain America’s words in my head,” he wrote. “What is exciting is the possibility of exploration, of avoiding the repetition of a voice I’ve tired of.” Mr. Coates will work with the artists Leinil Yu, who will draw the interior panels, and Alex Ross, whose painted covers, reminiscent of Norman Rockwell, have made him a favorite of comics writers and fans.

CreditElizabeth Weinberg for The New York Times Supported by By Jason Zinoman Photographs by Elizabeth Weinberg LOS ANGELES — By the end of March, one of the most famous rooms in comedy will close its doors when Marc Maron leaves the garage where he taped interviews with the biggest stand-up and improv names, superstar actors and writers, even a president, for his essential podcast, “WTF.” Mr. Maron, 54, who has recorded nearly 900 episodes, will continue to produce the podcast in a new garage in a more spacious, two-floor Craftsman home 10 minutes away, but make no mistake, an era is ending. When he began broadcasting from this space in the Highland Park neighborhood here in 2009, Mr. Maron was a struggling stand-up comic experimenting with a niche form. His intimate conversations turned the garage into a confessional booth for comics, one where Todd Glass came out of the closet and Carlos Mencia and Dane Cook addressed accusations that they stole jokes. On the strength of his empathetic, probing interviews, he developed a loyal audience, helped popularize podcasts and played a critical role in the birth of the comedy boom. He also resuscitated his career. Now he’s a TV star (he just finished shooting the second season of the acclaimed Netflix comedy “GLOW”) and his stand-up shows fill theaters. The garage itself has become as much of a character on the podcast as any of the guests. Mr. Maron has mythologized it as a magical and unlikely space, a dive alcove on a hill where guarded celebrities feel free to open up. Images of the garage show up in press photos, but it is perhaps most vivid in the imaginations of his regular listeners. On a recent morning, Mr. Maron gave me a tour of this vanishing landmark, a nostalgic trip that took an aptly dramatic detour when his mother showed up. Even after he made enough money to upgrade his relatively modest home, he stayed in part because of anxiety about his ability to recreate the garage that changed his life. But as he got older, the mess accumulating around his desk bothered him. “It started to look like a sad roadside attraction,” he said. “Dust and cobwebs. People were going to be like: This is weird and gross.” Mr. Maron, standing near stacks of “Please Kill Me,” the classic oral history of punk rock he often gives to guests, sounded slightly embarrassed to admit that he wanted a little comfort. Or at least a bathroom, so guests wouldn’t have to use the one inside his home, a sticking point with girlfriends in the past. He says he’s excited to start from scratch, and I couldn’t help but notice the room he’s leaving doubled as a shrine to his past. Along with myriad fan-made portraits, he’s surrounded by photos of relatives and former loves and mementos from botched relationships (the Air Canada receipt accidentally sent to his first wife for a flight to see the woman who’d become his second). There are also awards (a medal from The Harvard Lampoon) and posters from comedy specials like his HBO half-hour (“I was sweaty and weird, and in retrospect it wasn’t great.”) He’s thinking about getting rid of some of this stuff in the move, he said, taking out the letter from Mr. Cook making nice after a contentious episode as well as the photo of his second wife. “I don’t think I’m going to put her up,” he said. “She got me sober, so once a year I call to say thank you. Last year, she said, ‘If I wanted to hear from you, I’ll let you know.’ Oh, I’m that guy. I don’t want to be that guy.” Mr. Maron pointed to a baby photo, this one of his mother, Toby Maron, in a leather chair holding him, gazing at her son with a raised eyebrow. He imagined what she was thinking: “How do I do this?” he said, adding, “She never figured it out.” As it happened, his mother, 76, was visiting from Florida and minutes later, she called and he told her to come on over. After arriving wearing a “GLOW” jacket, she sat in the guest’s chair. “It’s so uncomfortable, I really couldn’t believe it,” she said. “All these big people sat in that chair, it is beyond my comprehension.” Before he rebuilt his life in the garage, Mr. Maron considered ending it there. He began his podcast after his second marriage fell apart and his career was languishing. “I was miserably depressed and thought if this doesn’t work, I’ll kill myself in here,” he said, pointing to where he contemplated suicide, inches from where former President Barack Obama sipped tea. He has enough distance from that now to crack a joke: “But I always think about suicide, because I find it relaxing.” On the wall behind the guest’s chair sits a paper with a list of good and bad traits he inherited from his father, Barry Maron. The “Barry Curses” part includes “worry,” “unable to hide himself” and “suicide.” “He would leave the house with a gun in his hand and swear he would not come back,” Ms. Maron said about her ex-husband, who is still alive, then nodded to her son. “It’s much harder coming from him.” Mr. Maron said he would keep his secondhand bookshelf with the “L.A. County Mental Health” sticker that he never peeled off. The new place has more light and higher ceilings, but Mr. Maron emphasized that it wasn’t a studio. “It’s still difficult,” he said. “I’m still going to deal with people working on the yard outside.” Toward the end of the interview in his garage, Ms. Maron said she had her doubts about the move. “How does this help?” he responded sharply, sounding exasperated but also clearly enjoying the comic potential of this clash. And yet, if this was a bit, she was committed to it: “This is such a special place,” she said. Mr. Maron turned away from his mother and looked up in the air, this time sounding genuinely annoyed: “Jesus!”   Advertisement",5810
5a96ee46410cf7000162e7a1,2018-02-28T18:00:34+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/arts/dance/review-company-wayne-mcgregor-autobiography.html,Culture,"Even with a title as seemingly straightforward as “Autobiography,” a dance by the brainy British choreographer Wayne McGregor isn’t likely to be plain memoir. And sure enough, the work, which had its United States debut at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, was partly generated through science. Mr. McGregor had his genome sequenced. Before each performance a computer algorithm based on that biographical data determines the sequencing of the dance’s 23 sections. So each performance is different. Yet for a work to be reordered meaningfully, it must have some comprehensible order to begin with. In “Autobiography,” the title and number of each section are flashed as that section starts, and the titles suggest parts of a life, or ideas about one: Nature, Nurture, Aging, Sleep. Yet if these titles were decoupled from their sections and reshuffled, it would make little difference. The one called “Memories” could just as well be “Choosing.” The cause is within, less the ordering of sections than the ordering of steps. Mr. McGregor’s troupe is no longer called Random Dance — it’s Company Wayne McGregor — but his sense of sequence is still random in effect, section to section and moment to moment. As ever, his androgynous dancers are a hyper-flexible tribe, able to stretch, splay and bend every which way. Amid this signature elasticity, Mr. McGregor now adds emotional gestures: heads in hands, bodies cradling bodies. But these gestures are just extra bits in the blender, no more or less affecting. Instead of shape or heart, there is impressive surface style. The set by Ben Cullen Williams is a spiky metal grid that hangs above the dancers and sometimes descends upon them like a cage contracting. Lucy Carter’s lighting does even more to slice and dice the stage space. Its sweeping planes of illumination are sculptural and dynamic. All this technical sophistication, though, seems to be at the service of a fundamentally unsophisticated sensibility, most glaringly exposed by the music. When the piece debuted in Britain, some critics complained about harsh blasts in the electronic score by Jlin. I wanted earplugs for the soft sections, protection from sentimentality and the dull thudding of chic cliché. Except for a brief respite of Corelli, we might have been in the lounge of a boutique hotel. The combination of this music with the preening, aggressive-recessive manner of Mr. McGregor’s choreography is often close to unbearable, and the scrambled structure offers no path through the mire. For all the intellectual effort that his work has long flaunted — this program credits institutes across Europe as “ongoing scientific partners” — it has never been dry movement research. The investigations of corporeal possibilities are electrified, with enough spectacle to make you wonder what it might be masking. Perhaps “Autobiography” is revealing after all. Has there always been this much schmaltz beneath the science?",2942
5a96ee44410cf7000162e7a0,2018-02-28T18:00:32+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/arts/music/review-louisiana-philharmonic-carnegie-hall.html,Culture,"Over the last decade, Carnegie Hall’s composer in residence position has tended to go to veteran iconoclasts whose innovations have taken root in the broader classical scene. Meredith Monk, Louis Andriessen and Kaija Saariaho, for example, have all been celebrated with the concert series that come with the Carnegie post, the Debs Composer’s Chair. I’ve noticed, listening to a range of these series, that programs devoted exclusively to the chosen composer’s works are often impressive. Less satisfying, on the whole, have been the concerts in which the composer is tucked — or, more to the point, jammed — into a broader concept or next to other works. This year Philip Glass holds the chair. And Tuesday evening was his turn with that latter format. In its Carnegie debut, the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra and its music director, Carlos Miguel Prieto, played two of his lesser-known orchestral pieces — “Days and Nights in Rocinha” (1997) and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra (2000) — on a program that also included Silvestre Revueltas’s “La Noche de los Mayas.” You don’t need to squint to identify the connecting thread here. The incandescent Revueltas suite, derived from one of his film scores, is a touchstone of the Mexican repertoire; pairing it with Mr. Glass’s tribute to Rocinha, a Rio de Janeiro favela, gives the program a vaguely Latin American theme. The Concerto Fantasy doesn’t share that theme, even vaguely. But it does spotlight percussionists, which puts it in a stylistic neighborhood adjacent to some of Revueltas’s higher-octane passages. It’s neat enough on paper. But the problem is that these two Glass pieces aren’t close to his most interesting. The Concerto Fantasy’s beginning, with its uncanny similarity to the stomping opening of the “Mission: Impossible” theme, is, at best, distracting. (Mr. Glass has denied plagiarizing, saying that he doesn’t watch television.) More disappointing is how nothing else in the work manages to be as melodically memorable. During the Louisiana Philharmonic’s performance, the strings were frequently swamped by the timpanists (Jim Atwood and Paul Yancich, stationed at the front of Carnegie’s stage). Balance issues also managed to blunt the impact of the Revueltas work, which opened the concert. In its first movement, the low brass instruments covered other sections. During the final movement’s percussion-driven fusillades, the piano had difficulty punching through. After intermission, there was more of a sense of this orchestra’s refinement. In Mr. Glass’s “Rocinha,” Mr. Prieto’s feel for subtle shifts in dynamics created an environment both dreamy and dramatic. The piece does not storm out of the gate. It builds slowly, as successive revisions of the opening melody are passed between sections. When all the players converge, that core melodic material still lingers, but new harmonic relationships have flowered, suggesting a congenial evening of revelry. Even during this almost-rowdy climax, the strings projected a graceful, shimmering clarity, and helped elevate a minor work into a minor marvel. This same polished ensemble sound reappeared during the orchestra’s encore: “Antrópolis,” a new work by the Mexican composer Gabriela Ortiz. The performance of this strongly conceived piece made me want to hear the Philharmonic play some better-quality symphonic Glass, or a concert performance of one of his operas, many of which have rarely been heard in New York.",3479

The conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the next music director of the Metropolitan Opera, had spent the day leading a dress rehearsal of Richard Strauss’s dense “Elektra,” which opens on Thursday. And it wasn’t long before he was due back in the pit to conduct the evening performance of Wagner’s nearly six-hour, stamina-testing “Parsifal.” As he walked back to his hotel near Central Park during his brief break last Friday, Mr. Nézet-Séguin considered fitting in a nap. Instead, he opted for a workout — using a smartphone app to connect with a personal trainer — and a light supper. “It’s very simple moves,” he said of his exercising afterward, as he walked back to the opera house. “Mostly stretching, just to make sure that tonight is good.” His ambitious biathlon underscored the generational change that is underway at the Met, where Mr. Nézet-Séguin, 42, is set to become music director next season, succeeding James Levine, 74, who was appointed to the position the year Mr. Nézet-Séguin was born. Mr. Nézet-Séguin is inheriting a great opera house facing great challenges: shaky finances and a box office slump. And then there is the painful fallout from the last years of Mr. Levine, who stepped down as music director in 2016 after more than a decade of serious health problems, and was suspended in December after being accused of sexual misconduct. (The Met is still investigating the accusations, which Mr. Levine has denied.) A long day spent with Mr. Nézet-Séguin suggested that he is already changing the temperature at the Met — projecting energy and enthusiasm; establishing a rapport with the orchestra, singers and staff; and making his mark in two operas closely associated with Mr. Levine. He is already putting his stamp on the orchestra: On Friday he told the players that he had appointed the violinist Benjamin Bowman as one of the Met’s two concertmasters. 10:02 a.m. His day was not originally supposed to include quite as much epic drama, or such an epic workload. A daytime rehearsal of “Elektra” had long been planned, but Mr. Nézet-Séguin was supposed to have the night off: It was the one “Parsifal” he was not meant to conduct. But when the scheduled conductor withdrew, citing illness, he agreed to take it on. 10:30 a.m. Ninety-nine players rehearsed “Elektra,” which uses one of the biggest orchestras in opera, and to make room for them the Met lowered its pit by a foot and a half. From the fierce opening chords, Mr. Nézet-Séguin was generous with praise, flashing lots of smiles and frequently exclaiming, “Bravo!” But there were moments of steel, too. At one point, he stopped the orchestra and beat time with his baton on his left palm, telling the players, “I need everyone to be less free — more with me.” 2 p.m. After a full run-through on the Met stage, Mr. Nézet-Séguin summoned the opera’s principal singers to a studio three levels below ground to share his observations. They discussed tempos (“I was schlepping!” he said, apologizing for a spot where he felt he had gone too slowly); worked to shape a few key phrases; and discussed subtly changing the blocking at one tricky point so the singers could see him better. Michaela Schuster, the mezzo-soprano singing Klytämnestra, asked if he could take one section a bit faster. He readily agreed. “I’m glad you gave me the note!” he said. “There is this culture of ‘You can’t say anything to the maestro,’ ” he added afterward. “And I’m consciously breaking that.” 5:30 p.m. “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The call is one half-hour,” the stage manager announced over the monitors. Mr. Nézet-Séguin had recently arrived in his dressing room, just steps from the orchestra pit. The room has a piano, a button-tufted leather couch and a counter where supplies for the night (three bananas, two chocolate chip cookies, a bag of almonds and several bottles of water) were already waiting. Mr. Nézet-Séguin opened a wood-clad locker and took out his tails; extricated a shirt from dry-cleaner’s plastic; gathered cuff links and shoes; and strained slightly to take his three-volume “Parsifal” score off a high shelf.  “This was obviously done for someone taller than me,” said Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who is 5-foot-5. At 6:04 Mr. Nézet-Séguin emerged from his room, fully dressed, walked past a wardrobe case with “J. Levine” stenciled on it, and entered the pit, to cheers. A moment later, the opera began. 7:49 p.m. As the applause for the first act was still ringing out, Mr. Nézet-Séguin emerged from the pit and walked toward his dressing room, stopping to chat with musicians along the way. Jason Haaheim, one of the principal timpanists, had some thoughts about the positioning of the timpani during the “Elektra” rehearsal. Outside the men’s locker room Mr. Nézet-Séguin stopped David Krauss, one of the principal trumpets. “Those C-major chords were, so, so …” he said, gesturing enthusiastically. “So what?” Mr. Krauss asked. “So pure!” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “There’s still time,” Mr. Krauss said wryly, and they both laughed. 9:42 p.m. Mr. Nézet-Séguin was more visibly winded after the second act, with its intense, driven passages of dark magic, attempted seduction and hard-won enlightenment. This time when he got to his dressing room, he grabbed a towel and washed his face with cold water. “A run for me is a story — the last performance should be better than the first, there’s no question,” he said. “It should be a trajectory. Better, what does that mean? Deeper, tighter, whatever it is. Last time was so dramatic, and I thought with my kind of energy today maybe I shouldn’t try that road. And as result I pushed less, I drove less — and everyone was with me and it was very sensuous.” Then, he said, he had “decided to explode.” 11:47 p.m. After the final bows, Mr. Nézet-Séguin and the cast stayed onstage, exchanging hugs and laughs as the stagehands tried to shoo them off and reset the stage for the matinee of “La Bohème” less than 13 hours later. “We survived!” Weston Sprott, a trombonist who had played in the daytime “Elektra” rehearsal and the nighttime “Parsifal,” said to Mr. Nézet-Séguin. 12:02 a.m. Mr. Nézet-Séguin left the stage door 14 hours after his arrival, signing a couple of autographs for die-hard Wagnerites waiting outside. Then he walked back to his hotel, his last stop before flying home to Montreal the next morning for a weekend of relaxation. If there is one thing Mr. Nézet-Séguin has been criticized for, it has been for taking on too much: He is also the music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Orchestre Métropolitain in his native Montreal, and is wrapping up his final season with the Rotterdam Philharmonic. But earlier on Friday, as he headed back to conduct “Parsifal,” he had brushed off the suggestion that he was overstretched. “Yes, I do have a high level of energy — that’s clear,” he said. “That’s maybe why I love New York. There is this kind of pace. But I am able, definitely, to also stop and do nothing.” Michael Cooper covers classical music and dance for the Culture Desk.

We need to make the art world a more equitable, just and safe place for women at all levels.” She said she has no involvement in the ongoing litigation involving Mr. Landesman, Artforum and Amanda Schmitt, a former employee of the magazine. The timing proved opportune for Ann Temkin, MoMA’s chief curator of painting and sculpture, who was looking to fill the position in her department left vacant by the promotion of Leah Dickerman to director of editorial and content strategy at the museum. “What occurred to me is that the editor of Artforum is actually in a closely parallel situation” to that of a curator, said Ms. Temkin. “You’re making all kinds of curatorial decisions about what to cover, what gets more or less space, what goes where. It involves the same sorts of prioritizing and balancing.” She added that the breadth of art Ms. Kuo has covered through her writing, editing and public speaking over the last decade “puts her in a very good position to have a sound perspective on the art of our time.” Ms. Kuo, who defended her dissertation on the group Experiments in Art and Technology in December and will receive her Ph.D. from Harvard this spring, starts at the museum on April 2. “MoMA is the place that has in large part told the story of modern art in the West,” she said. “Most of my scholarship and work has been about trying to open up the histories that we tell about modern and contemporary art. It will be great to collaborate with the museum in continuing to broaden its interdisciplinary and international scope.”",2213

It’s a realm of misunderstandings, disappointments, unfulfilled longings and everyday betrayals, and Soccer Mommy’s songs recount them in a haze of acceptance and resentment. “In the summer you said you loved me like an animal/Stayed beside me just enough to keep your belly full,” Ms. Allison sings in “So Clean”; then she devotes the remaining verses to missing him, predatory as he is, through the fall, winter and spring. Soccer Mommy joins a wavelet of young women — along with Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski and many others — who are using gentle voices, pristine melodies and the expressive imperfections of indie rock for songs that probe vulnerability and trauma, self-sabotage and self-preservation. They are continuing a longstanding role of female singer-songwriters as pop’s bearers of emotional sensitivity and catharsis. But in the era of SoundCloud and Bandcamp, they need no one’s help or permission to go public. Whether anyone will listen is another question, but Soccer Mommy got through. Ms. Allison began posting home-recorded songs to Bandcamp as Soccer Mommy in 2015, during the summer when she was about to leave her hometown, Nashville, for college at New York University. (She has since dropped out and returned to Nashville to pursue her music career.) As Soccer Mommy, she wrote about leaving behind her first love, about new independence and infatuations, about dodging the gaze of parents, about having to suddenly feel “grown.” At first, with just a guitar, she was lonely and forlorn above all; her early digital EPs were titled “Songs for the Recently Sad” and “Songs From My Bedroom.” But she soon gathered additional instruments and confidence, turning Soccer Mommy into an indie-rock band and getting signed to Fat Possum. She reworked six Bandcamp songs and added two newer, more assertive ones for “Collection,” released last year. “Clean” — with nine songs and an instrumental interlude — is billed as Soccer Mommy’s debut album, Ms. Allison’s first to be conceived as a whole and recorded in a studio with backup musicians and a producer. It takes pains not to be at all slick. Ms. Allison’s voice often droops a little flat, instruments are hand-played rather than programmed and the mix is proudly smudgy. As if to insist that Soccer Mommy is still loyal to low-fi, a few songs flaunt deliberate studio glitches. A demo take is suddenly spliced into “Still Clean,” while in “Cool,” the sound of a tape slowing down derails the big rock buildup at the end. But even as it clings to indie modesty, “Clean” greatly expands the scope of Ms. Allison’s songs in both words and music. She’s not just sweet, sad and lovelorn any more. She’s riled enough, amid the tangle of guitar lines in “Your Dog,” to announce: “I want a love that lets me breathe/And I’ve been choking on your leash.” And she’s blunt and skeptical enough to face her insecurities about whether she could possibly live up to her boyfriend’s ex in “Last Girl,” with a chorus that asks, even as it echoes the beat of 1960s girl groups, “Why would you still want to be with me? She’s got everything.” Infidelity also looms, in “Flaw” and “Scorpio Rising.” She’s wildly attracted to the guy in “Scorpio Rising,” but she also clearly sees him eyeballing someone who’s “bubbly and sweet like a Coca-Cola.” In “Flaw,” she’s the one who strays, but, she sings, “I choose, choose to blame it all on you/’cause I don’t like the truth.” On Soccer Mommy’s previous band-style recordings, songs tended to stick to one sound from start to finish: a watery guitar strum, a certain band beat. But “Clean” is full of changes, newly willing to use contrast and dynamics. “Blossom (Wasting All My Time),” a song about “wondering if you really love me” and finding someone better, starts and ends with a strummed guitar, but opens out depths of bass and reverberation along the way. “Skin,” a song about deep physical yearning — “I’m clawing at your skin trying to see your bones” — juxtaposes a stolid drumbeat with an octave-leaping vocal line and multiple tiers of guitars and glockenspiel, striving to incarnate the craving in sound. But she also matter-of-factly adds, “I wish you also felt like this.” Both cleareyed and passionate, she is growing up in public, unabashed. Soccer Mommy“Clean”(Fat Possum)    Advertisement",4446

His new book, “Enlightenment Now,” is a spirited and exasperated rebuke to anyone who refuses to concede that the world is becoming a better place. “None of us are as happy as we ought to be, given how amazing our world has become,” he writes. “People seem to bitch, moan, whine, carp and kvetch as much as ever.” In the United States, this spectacular ingratitude is lamentably bipartisan, he says, shared by anti-establishmentarians on both sides who refuse to see the light: “Left-wing and right-wing political ideologies have themselves become secular religions, providing people with a community of like-minded brethren, a catechism of sacred beliefs, a well-populated demonology and a beatific confidence in the righteousness of their cause.” Of course, Pinker’s confidence in the righteousness of his own cause may come across as similarly beatific (he’s an atheist who’s confident enough to use the word “blessed” without a hint of irony), but as he repeatedly tells us, the evidence is on his side. Scientific discovery and technological developments have ensured that “everything is amazing.” He’s merely expounding the obvious. Not so obvious, though, that he didn’t need to write a 550-page book to make his case. Pinker is a scientist — a psychologist, to be exact — and he prides himself on being thorough, valiantly fighting “progressophobia” with his voluble sentences and a fusillade of data. When he published “The Better Angels of Our Nature” in 2011, he believed he unequivocally showed that modernity and liberal Enlightenment values had made people less violent, and so he was taken aback by skeptical reviews that had the temerity to question his research methods or his conclusions. “I had thought that a parade of graphs with time on the horizontal axis, body counts or other measures of violence on the vertical, and a line that meandered from the top left to the bottom right would cure audiences” of their delusions and “persuade them that at least in this sphere of well-being the world has made progress,” he recalls near the beginning of “Enlightenment Now.” But Pinker’s inability to “cure audiences” and “persuade them” doesn’t mean he has reconsidered his rhetorical approach; 300 pages after bemoaning those poor souls who read “Better Angels” and weren’t bowled over by his panoply of statistics, Pinker doubles down with still more data. “We have seen six dozen graphs that have vindicated the hope for progress by charting the ways in which the world has been getting better,” he writes. To that end, Pinker offers numbers to show that the world has, on the whole, become safer, healthier and wealthier. These benefits are more pronounced in the West, but even in developing countries conditions have improved through impressive public health advances, including better maternal care and vaccination programs. Whereas many people used to die from something so basic as lack of access to food, today rates of chronic undernourishment and catastrophic famines are on the decline. His optimism is resilient. Pinker expresses mild alarm about climate change, but he has faith in carbon pricing, nuclear energy and other proposals that “have been bruited about.” He also shows a modicum of concern about inequality, though he says we mistakenly conflate “inequality with unfairness,” when disparate outcomes should be “seen as a harbinger of opportunity, a sign that education and other routes to upward mobility might pay off.” Besides, he has little patience for individual tragedy; it’s the aggregate that excites him. Even if manufacturing jobs have gone to China, “and the world’s poor have gotten richer in part at the expense of the American lower middle class,” he still sees this as cause for celebration: “As citizens of the world considering humanity as a whole, we have to say that the trade-off is worth it.” But life isn’t lived in the aggregate, and it’s crude utilitarian sentiments like this — a jarring blend of chipper triumphalism and unfeeling sang froid — that makes “Enlightenment Now” such a profoundly maddening book. Part of the problem is that Pinker succumbs to a version of the magical thinking he otherwise rails against. For all his intermittent disclaimers about how past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, he keeps slipping into messianic anticipation. “Though I am skittish about any notion of historical inevitability, cosmic forces or mystical arcs of justice,” he writes, “some kinds of social change really do seem to be carried along by an inexorable tectonic force.” He admits that the presidency of Donald J. Trump might be a “setback” to the forward march of progress. But as long as he can consign Trump and authoritarian populism to “a pushback of elements of human nature,” he can stay in thrall to the wonders of “Enlightenment institutions” — and ignore the possibility that such institutions, with their blithe consolidation of power in the name of progress, might have helped to stoke such populist rage. Such defensiveness is puzzling. Not only is it unscientific; it’s gratuitous, and Pinker ends up undermining his own arguments with a tendency to overstate his case. He is so determined to keep the Enlightenment unsullied and pristine that he seethes at anyone who deigns to point out that it wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, scolding “prophets of doom” like the philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer for perpetrating “a demonization campaign” that drew a link between the Enlightenment project and fascism. He is especially piqued by those who observe that science was sometimes used to justify monstrous ends, including racism and eugenics. In one particularly tortured passage, Pinker goes so far as to downplay the harm of the notorious Tuskegee syphilis study — which tracked syphilis in 600 African-American men, many of them poor sharecroppers, withholding information and proper treatment from them — on the grounds that the doctors “did not infect the participants, as many believe.” The study, a “one-time failure to prevent harm to a few dozen people” (as he breezily puts it) “may even have been defensible by the standards of the day.” Why do this? Why not simply state that the study is a ghastly stain on the history of medicine? Despite the occasional warning that progress is “hard-won” and “perfect order” isn’t “the natural state of affairs,” Pinker’s book is filled with such fulsome apologias, which inadvertently suggest that the gains of the Enlightenment are so delicate that they require the historical gloss he compulsively provides. There’s a noble kernel to Pinker’s project. He wants to discourage the kind of fatalism that leads people to think the only way forward is to tear everything down. But he seems surprisingly blind to how he fuels such fatalism by playing to the worst stereotype of the enlightened cosmopolitan: disdainful and condescending — sympathetic to humanity in the abstract but impervious to the suffering of actual human beings.",7072

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Stephen Colbert is outraged that the Trump administration has not authorized the National Security Agency to fully investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Mike Rogers, the head of the N.S.A., said he was still waiting for the president to give him the authority to look into Russian interference more deeply. Colbert took Trump to task, making a reference to his tweetstorm earlier that day, in which the president called the continuing Russia investigation a “witch hunt.” Jimmy Fallon responded sarcastically to the news that Trump is already planning for 2020. Seth Meyers took a critical look at how the Trump administration is handling the opioid epidemic. Bruce Willis crashed an installment of Freestylin’ With the Roots. Omarosa Manigault, the controversial former White House aide who was recently voted off the reality show “Big Brother,” will sit down with Colbert for her first late-night interview since leaving the Trump administration.

Donald Glover’s comedy about life on the margins of the Atlanta hip-hop scene could detour at any moment. It was a richly detailed story about relationships and money and black life that also gave us a black rapper named Justin Bieber, a full-length faux-cable-news debate show (with fake commercials) and a scene of people being run over by an invisible car. In “Atlanta Robbin’ Season,” which begins Thursday on FX, the mystery begins with the title. Is this simply Season 2 of “Atlanta”? Is it an entirely new series? It is the same. And it is different. And that’s a wonderful, surreal, hilarious thing. “Atlanta” has not become “CSI: Atlanta.” It continues the story of Earn (Mr. Glover), the manager to his cousin Alfred (Brian Tyree Henry), who raps under the name Paper Boi. But first it drops us off with another set of characters, in a vignette about a peculiar crime — not exactly comedy, not exactly crime drama, but a kind of absurdist hybrid. That introduces us to “robbin’ season,” a term defined by Alfred’s deadpan stoner-philosopher roommate, Darius (Lakeith Stanfield): the time just before Christmas, when presents need to be bought and “everybody’s got to eat.” But where does robbin’ season stop and regular life begin? Especially for the struggling creatives in “Atlanta” (Alfred’s hit single won him more fame than cash), it can be hard to tell. Each of the first three episodes either involves or mentions robbery, sometimes scary, sometimes ludicrous, as with the armed man who sticks up an old friend out of nowhere, apologizing profusely throughout it: “Hey, my fault, bro.” But there are also scams and hustles and the everyday pickpocketing of dignity. When Earn goes out with Van (Zazie Beetz), his friend, his sometime lover and the mother of his child, the movie theater refuses to accept a $100 bill from him but takes one from the middle-aged white man behind him in line. This focus puts a finer point on what was an intermittent theme in the first season: the larcenous nature of everyday life. Money in “Atlanta” is like an occult force, flowing through everything but accessible only through arcane arts and invocations. You can feel its presence in the loft-like office of a streaming music company that Earn and Alfred visit. After a disappointing meeting — the audio system glitches trying to play Alfred’s music — they wander around and see another artist inside a conference room, performing for rapt staffers. Success seems so close, but it’s behind impenetrable, soundproof glass. The season also introduces Clark County (RJ Walker), a more successful rapper whose manager — a white guy — has connections to secure the rich advertising deals that elude Alfred. (Though he’s laid-back offstage, he’s been typecast into a bad-boy role by the industry; the only endorsement he’s offered is for “cocaine white cheddar” snack chips.) When the characters in “Atlanta” do get money, it’s like a silent alarm goes off somewhere; the entire world becomes focused on separating the newfound cash from its holder. A windfall attracts new temporary friends; nightclubs transform into hungry money-extraction vortices. Along with its new title, “Atlanta Robbin’ Season” has a different, more serial structure from the impressionistic first season. What’s blessedly the same: the dry sense of humor, the luscious visual style established by the frequent director Hiro Murai and the writers’ effortless fluency with social media’s language and quirks. (A brilliant early bit involves the popularity of white-girl acoustic covers of rap songs on YouTube.) The storytelling in “Atlanta” is dreamlike, which is another way of saying that it’s unusually realistic. As in life, weird or comical developments don’t announce themselves before they happen: They just start happening, and your consciousness has to catch up. The off-balance feeling this creates is the buzz of watching “Atlanta.” That buzz kicks in during the first episode, where Earn finds himself moderating a dispute at the house of his uncle Willy (a crackling guest spot by the comedian Katt Williams). Willy casually mentions that he has an alligator in the bathroom. You don’t see an alligator, just a closed door. Is he kidding? Maybe. But now you are in a world where an alligator might be in the next room. This is what “Atlanta” is so good at: dropping you into scenes blind, trusting that getting oriented will be half the pleasure. The approach requires close attention, and the episodes reward a second watching. But they’re hardly homework. Mr. Glover and his creative team (including his brother, Stephen) are in enough control of their material to produce meticulously crafted episodes that play like offhanded shaggy-dog (or -alligator) stories. “Robbin’ Season” is so good, it’s almost criminal.",4974

And Tyler Henry, the Hollywood Medium, is back at it. THE LOOMING TOWER on Hulu. This highly anticipated 10-part series is ostensibly about the Sept. 11 attacks. But the main adversaries here are not the United States and Al Qaeda but rather the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. Based on Lawrence Wright’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, this series begins with the 1998 bombing of the United States embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and shows how infighting between the two federal agencies — and their unwillingness to cooperate or share information — may have allowed Al Qaeda to move forward with its attack. The television drama stalwarts Peter Sarsgaard and Jeff Daniels square off against each other in lead roles. CASABLANCA on FilmStruck. While other streaming services are locked in an arms race to create original content, FilmStruck’s latest gambit was to add more than 600 classic films from Hollywood’s Golden Age, including “Singin’ in the Rain,” “Citizen Kane” and “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Film buffs will debate this, but the crown jewel might very well be “Casablanca,” Michael Curtiz’s indelible World War II-era romance. You probably already know: Ingrid Bergman walks into Humphrey Bogart’s gin joint; Sam plays it again; the usual suspects are rounded up; a beautiful friendship begins.

In the first episode, the family welcomes a new member: the baby daughter of Amy (Amber Marshall). HOLLYWOOD MEDIUM 9 p.m. on E! Some are skeptical about Tyler Henry’s ability to communicate with the dead: “Mr. Henry plays the role of naïf but is a con man of the highest order,” Jon Caramanica wrote in The New York Times. But whether he has clairvoyant powers is almost beside the point. The allure of his show comes with the reactions of his famous guests, who often break down and show a very different side than their usual chipper selves on the talk-show circuit. (Ellen DeGeneres said he changed her life.) In the third-season premiere, Mr. Henry pokes around the minds of Kristin Cavallari, Jim Parsons, and Todd and Savannah Chrisley. WACO 10 p.m. on Paramount. This mini-series has received largely positive reviews for its depiction of the 1993 Waco siege in which David Koresh, a Texan with apocalyptic Christian views, led Branch Davidians into an F.B.I. standoff.

The first method actor was an untrained peasant woman named Hollis, who played Mrs. Noah in a socko 14th-century run of the morality play “Noah’s Ark.” Or so Jordan Harrison would have you believe. In “The Amateurs,” a hilarious, slightly eggheaded and strangely moving medieval backstager that opened on Tuesday at the Vineyard Theater, he locates the dawning of individual character — onstage and off — in the moment people began to doubt God. And Hollis’s troupe, in which God is played by a mellifluous blowhard named Larking, has good reason to doubt him. Their tour of Italy — performing not just “Noah’s Ark,” but also those crowd pleasers “Cain and Abel” and “The Fall of Man” — is really a desperate attempt to keep a step ahead of the plague. They do not always succeed. “Half of everyone we’ve ever known,” says Rona, a disgruntled ingénue, “is in the ground now.” This makes casting difficult. In “Noah’s Ark,” which features a “Seven Deadly Sins” prologue, Rona plays both Gluttony and Mrs. Shem, until a death in the troupe requires her to play Mr. Shem as well. In general, the actors are what might now be called versatile, and also what might now be called bad. Larking (Thomas Jay Ryan) doesn’t make much of a distinction between God and Lechery; when Gregory, the dim set designer, is dragooned to play Sloth, you can hardly hear him behind his mask. As Noah and Pride, Brom (Kyle Beltran) is as stiff as a corpse, and Rona (Jennifer Kim) just doesn’t care. Their flatness matches that of their biblical repertoire, which is formal, presentational and strictly without subtext: “like a school play where the kids play vegetables.” To alter the rhyming couplets with extraneous emotion or a hint of free will would be a form of blasphemy. But after suffering an even more grievous loss than usual, Hollis (Quincy Tyler Bernstine) begins to question God — and also His dialogue. In a moment of stubborn curiosity that alters the aesthetic history of mankind, she asks what would happen if Mrs. Noah just didn’t feel like getting on that ark one day. What would happen, Mr. Harrison suggests, is the Renaissance, or very nearly. The beginning of self-consciousness, he argues, is the beginning of enlightenment. If this sounds a bit heady for a rollicking tragicomedy in which pratfalls and death throes are tumbled together, that is part of the play’s unusual scheme. Halfway through the troupe’s journey toward salvation — which for them means a command performance with an important duke who may take them under his wing — “The Amateurs” jumps ahead seven centuries. This is only in part so that Mr. Harrison, who now appears as a character onstage, can connect the dots between the Black Death and AIDS. The detour also allows him to delay the return trip down the mountain of plot he has spent the first half of the play climbing. What Mr. Harrison, the character, says he is avoiding is the very object of that trek: the play’s catharsis, which he doubts he can earn. In a world of endless suffering, a catharsis is “innately complacent,” he concludes. Like the rest of “The Amateurs,” this despairing contemporary interlude is frantically funny, even when it veers into an art history lecture. Playing Mr. Harrison, Michael Cyril Creighton, who in the medieval scenes is handy Gregory, paints a witty, affectionate portrait of a neurotic playwright afraid of his own tools. It can’t be a realistic portrait; Mr. Harrison could hardly wield those tools so expertly if his hands were shaking. As in his 2015 play “Marjorie Prime” — a superbly controlled exercise in speculative fiction that elicits profound feeling without appearing to solicit it — “The Amateurs” works by a kind of indirection. The magic happens, by design, wherever the playwright isn’t pointing. So the postmodern gewgaws are a bit of a decoy. They might work even better if there were fewer of them, as Mr. Harrison seems to know. (“Hopefully you aren’t allergic to these sorts of shenanigans,” his stand-in says.) When Ms. Bernstine interrupts his interruption with her own take on Hollis’s story, you begin to wonder whether the material has gone a bit too deep into the theatrical weeds, too far for civilians to follow. But just as she did in Anne Washburn’s heady backstager “10 out of 12,” Ms. Bernstine, so legible and relatable and seemingly guileless, grounds even the most meta material with quiet feeling. Still, I kept thinking that a fully cooked play shouldn’t need so much exegesis and counterpoint. It didn’t seem likely that Mr. Harrison’s self-parodying seminar, however amusing, could deepen the play’s action when it returned to medieval Italy. Eventually, though, I understood that deepening wasn’t the point; distancing was. “The Amateurs” wants to be seen with a form of double vision in which the past and the present are both present. We are meant to be vigilant about the “luxury of fiction,” with its false sense of endings. Which is why these medieval actors all have names you might expect to find on a teen soap opera. At every turn, Oliver Butler’s gutsy production supports rather than tries to disguise such anachronisms. The singsong verse of the morality plays is countered by ribald cross talk delivered with naturalistic verve. And whenever the troupe’s pageant wagon — a cabinet of curiosities filled with handmade surprises — sits in the middle of the Vineyard’s modern stage (both designed by David Zinn) you see in one image the continuity of human creativity in the face of disaster. The cast, which also includes Greg Keller as a newcomer to the troupe, is a cabinet of curiosities in itself, a collection of Off Broadway treasures. Of course, all actors love to re-enact theatrical disaster stories, and Mr. Harrison loads “The Amateurs” with plenty of gags. But Ms. Bernstine and the others are seriously funny, by which I mean funny in a serious way: a good thing in a play that has so much on its mind. Among the themes that light up like fireflies here and there are the nature of sin, the purpose of art, the low status of actors and the low status of humans in general. If history has been a drama, it has consigned almost everyone throughout time to the chorus. And so it really is a thrilling, expansive, world-changing moment in a very sneaky play when Hollis, contemplating Mrs. Noah, first asks, What’s my motivation? Which is a question you can only begin to contemplate after asking, What is God’s?",6484

Her will was unsealed on Tuesday, but the document did little to clear up the questions surrounding a literary estate that is assumed to be worth tens of millions of dollars. Here is how The New York Times covered some of the key moments in her life and after her death. In The Times, Herbert Mitgang wrote: “Here is a storyteller justifying the novel as a form that transcends time and place.” Frank H.

Her death prompted reflections from critics and residents of her hometown. _____ Ms. Lee was known for her intense privacy. In March 2016, a judge in Monroe County, Ala., agreed to seal her will from public scrutiny. A lawsuit by The Times overturned that decision, but the mysteries surrounding Ms. Lee’s estate have only deepened.",1830
5a95efc9410cf7000162e503,2018-02-27T23:54:43+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/books/harper-lee-will.html,Culture,"When the novelist Harper Lee died in her sleep two years ago, at 89, she left a trail of lingering questions about her life and work. Why had she decided, in her final years, to publish a second novel, 55 years after her breakout success, “To Kill a Mockingbird”? Were there other unknown works? Who would inherit her literary papers, sought by many universities, as well as her estate, estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars? On Tuesday, an Alabama court unsealed Ms. Lee’s will, but the mystery surrounding one of American literature’s most cherished authors only deepened. The will, signed on February 11, 2016, eight days before her death, directed that the bulk of her assets, including her literary properties, be transferred into a trust she formed in 2011. Trust documents are private, so all questions about what will become of her literary papers and who beyond her closest relatives might benefit from her assets, will remain unanswered for now. It is also unclear how the will differed from any prior document Ms. Lee may have created to distribute her assets. Ms. Lee never married or had children, and the court papers identified her heirs and closest living relatives as a niece and three nephews, who are expected to receive an undisclosed portion of the estate through the trust. The will named Tonja B. Carter, Ms. Lee’s longtime lawyer, as the executor, or personal representative, of the estate, and it provided her with wide-ranging powers to shepherd Ms. Lee’s literary legacy and the rest of her assets. Ms. Carter had gone to court in 2016 to successfully persuade Probate Judge Greg Norris of Monroe County to seal the will, citing Ms. Lee’s desire for privacy. And while the estate had stressed in court papers that making the will public could lead to the “potential harassment” of individuals identified in it, the document itself is strikingly opaque. It was unsealed Tuesday on the basis of a lawsuit filed by The New York Times seeking to review the document. Lawyers for The Times argued that wills filed in a probate court in Alabama are typically public records, and that Ms. Lee’s privacy concerns were no different from those of others whose wills are processed through the court system. “It’s a public record, and the press and the public have a right to public records,” said Archie Reeves, the lawyer who represented The Times. Last week, as both sides prepared to depose witnesses, the estate withdrew its opposition to making the will public. It did not disclose its reasoning. The document’s lack of transparency will likely fuel skepticism among those who feel that Ms. Carter had amassed too much power over Ms. Lee’s career and legacy. The will gives Ms. Carter substantial control over Ms. Lee’s estate and her literary properties, which are assigned to the Mockingbird Trust, an entity that was formed in 2011. Ms. Carter served as one of its two trustees at the time. “It is not an uncommon will, and it is typically what we term a pour-over will where anything in the estate goes over to the trust and they don’t have to disclose the terms of the trust,” said Sidney C. Summey, an estate and trusts lawyer in Birmingham. “It is done quite often by people of means, people with notoriety and people who just want to be private,” Mr. Summey said. Ms. Lee’s relatives had supported efforts to seal the will. Phone calls to reach several members of her family were unsuccessful. As a personal representative, Ms. Carter is entitled to compensation for her work. The will allows the personal representative to earn additional fees as part of an organization, like a law firm, that does work for the estate. Ms. Carter declined to discuss the will, citing Ms. Lee’s penchant for privacy. “I will not discuss her affairs,” she said. One of the two witnesses to the will, Cynthia McMillan, a former resident assistant who had helped care for Ms. Lee at a facility where she had lived, said in an interview that Ms. Lee seemed competent when she signed it. “In my opinion, she was,” Ms. McMillian said. The estate was built largely on the outsize and enduring success of Ms. Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning debut novel, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” which since its publication in 1960, has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide and remains a staple on American school curriculums. In addition, “Go Set a Watchman,” her second novel, was the best-selling book of 2015 in the United States, and sold more than 1.6 million hardcover copies, according to NPD BookScan. “Mockingbird” alone sells more than a million copies a year worldwide, generating some $3 million in royalties for the copyright holder, according to court documents. Ms. Lee had always lived simply, despite her fame and mounting wealth, and long shared a modest brick home in Monroeville with her older sister, Alice, who died in 2014. Ms. Lee could be seen around town in sweatpants looking for bargains at a Dollar General Store, washing her clothes at a local Laundromat, drinking coffee at a McDonald’s or eating at David’s Catfish House, where her usual iced tea and a small plate of catfish would cost about $6. Often miscast as reclusive, she was no hermit, but she was as ferociously private as she was famous, and shunned interviews. She was thrust into the spotlight three years ago, when “Watchman” was released. Its publication sparked a debate about whether or not Ms. Lee had been pushed into publishing the novel, one that she had abandoned in the 1950s as an early effort at the story that would become “Mockingbird.” At the release of “Watchman,” there were already questions about Ms. Lee’s vulnerability and her mental and physical condition. She had suffered a stroke in 2007, had severe vision and hearing problems and had moved into an assisted living facility. In 2013, in a copyright dispute that went to court, Ms. Lee’s lawyers said she had been taken advantage of and coerced into signing away her copyright because she was “an elderly woman with physical infirmities that made it difficult for her to read and see.” The controversy surrounding “Watchman” divided Ms. Lee’s hometown, pitting some of her longtime friends and acquaintances, who doubted she had approved of the publication, against Ms. Lee’s lawyer, agent and publisher, generating the kind of public spectacle Ms. Lee abhorred. But an Alabama agency investigated whether Ms. Lee was a victim of elder abuse and financial fraud and determined that no abuse had occurred. Some scholars and fans embraced “Watchman” as a long awaited sequel to Ms. Lee’s debut work, while others dismissed it as an inferior rough draft, one that was eventually polished and reshaped into a masterpiece. Many fans were shocked to discover that Atticus Finch, the crusading lawyer who fights for racial equality in “Mockingbird,” is depicted in “Watchman” as an aging racist and segregationist who clashes with his daughter, a grown-up Scout, over her support for civil rights. Ms. Carter emerged as polarizing figure in the debate. She was at first credited with recovering Ms. Lee’s long lost novel, and recounted how she discovered the manuscript for “Watchman” in a safe deposit box in the summer of 2014. But others disputed that account and said Ms. Carter had been present when the manuscript was discovered in October 2011 during an appraisal by a rare books expert. The appraiser had come to inspect what was thought to be a “Mockingbird” manuscript, and Ms. Carter later said she had not realized at the time that actually a different manuscript had been reviewed. Still, many viewed Ms. Carter as Ms. Lee’s staunchest protector, and with a coterie of friends from the area, she is now helping to expand Ms. Lee’s literary legacy. Ms. Carter helps run a nonprofit, Mockingbird Company, that Ms. Lee created in 2015. It puts on a dramatization of “Mockingbird” in Monroeville each year. A different production, drawn from the novel and scripted by Aaron Sorkin, is headed for Broadway this year. A “Mockingbird” graphic novel, adapted by Fred Fordham, was approved by Ms. Lee’s estate and will be published in the fall. And there are new plans for the Harper Lee Trail, which local officials hope will attract hundreds of thousands of tourists a year to Monroeville. Planned attractions include a museum dedicated to Harper Lee and replications of characters’ houses in “To Kill a Mockingbird.” How this all would have sat with Ms. Lee also remains a matter of debate. She took pains to protect her intellectual property and often scorned attempts to commercialize her novel. In 2013, she sued a local museum, arguing that it had infringed on her trademark by selling “Mockingbird” themed T-shirts and trinkets (the suit was settled in 2014). And in a letter to a friend in 1993, she complained that Monroeville was turning into a “Mockingbird” tourist attraction. She expressed particular irritation at the strangers lingering in front of her house. “They came in VANS,” she wrote.",8977

The statuesque performer Jomama Jones was wearing a sleeveless gold sequined number while she formulated that question, which was also a demand. “I give you all permission to take me in,” she continued with the noblesse oblige of an entertainer fully aware of her glamour. Mind you, that outfit was just one of the five, all equally fabulous, she changed in and out of during her show, “Black Light,” a Public Theater offering at Joe’s Pub. Making her way among the tables, the singer gently teased the audience. To the gentleman who said he was from Mexico, she asked of his country, “Do they have the animal the cougar?” A grand diva in the lineage of Lola Falana and Diana Ross, Jomama Jones is the alter ego of the playwright and performer Daniel Alexander Jones. She has figured in some of his earlier shows, including “Jomama Jones: Radiate” (2011) and “Duat” (2016), in which Mr. Jones delved more directly into his own life and made the transformation into his character explicit. In “Black Light,” though, Mr. Jones lets Jomama take over. Besides ad-libs, she alternates, cabaret-style, between songs and convoluted stories. Her show incorporates biographical elements familiar to longtime fans. When she brought up her “dear, sweet friend and rival Tamika,” savvy members of last Thursday’s audience let out hoots. Most likely, they were in on the constructed back story, the same way people clap in delight whenever the decrepit chanteuse Kiki DuRane, a creation of Justin Vivian Bond, brings up her estranged son, Bradford. Mr. Jones even lovingly fabricated press coverage for Jomama, including a terrific reproduction of Jet magazine from the mid-1980s. Paradoxically for a concert, the energy distinctly falls when Jomama sings. The star has quite the pipes and is backed by an adept band, but the songs — written by Mr. Jones with Laura Jean Anderson, Bobby Halvorson, Dylan Meek and Josh Quat — tend to be pallid, hook-free lite funk and R&B. Considering that Prince loomed large over Jomama’s life, or at least her childhood, the sexy needle stays stuck in a safe green zone. Even Oana Botez’s glittery costumes are relatively demure. More surprising, the songs lack the humor and wit of Jomama’s banter. At first the stories appear unrelated. One involves Jomama hilariously fighting Tamika over Prince’s body (as pictured on a centerfold poster) back in 1979; another is about the singer’s Aunt Cleotha and her trusty shotgun. By the end, the two narrative arcs meet, sort of, for a piercing conclusion that plays on the title’s reference to ultraviolet light. As Jomama explains, “If you look into the dark long enough, all manner of things will be revealed.”",2763

But there have been rare exceptions. “The Silence of the Lambs”  swept the major categories, winning best picture, best director, best actor and best actress in 1992. Guillermo del Toro’s 2006 dark fantasy “Pan’s Labyrinth” emerged triumphant for best cinematography, art direction and makeup. Otherwise, the Oscars have mostly given chillers the cold shoulder. That could change this year with “Get Out,” which is nominated for best picture. It also garnered best director and original screenplay nods for Jordan Peele, and a best actor nomination for Daniel Kaluuya. Of course, it’s much more than a horror movie — it’s also a trenchant satire of America’s racial dynamics. Still, you can’t help but fear that “Get Out” might end up in “the sunken place” on Oscar night, given the lack of Academy appreciation for other terrifying classics. Here are some examples. The odds were stacked against this adaptation of Mary Shelley’s gothic classic in more ways than one. At that time, there were only three nominees in most of the Academy’s major categories, except for best picture, which had eight contenders. Yet the director James Whale’s stark depiction of the diabolical doctor played by Colin Clive and his stitched-together monster, played by Boris Karloff, failed to make the cut. Best actor went to the lead in another scary movie, Fredric March in “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” (who tied with Wallace Beery for “The Champ”), perhaps because he showed greater range in his dual role than Mr. Clive did in his single part. There were no supporting actor categories, but Mr. Karloff would have been a long shot anyway, since he was billed in the opening credits only as “?”. That’s pretty much the opposite of a “for your consideration” ad. Belated recognition came when Mel Brooks was nominated for best adapted screenplay for his 1974 spoof “Young Frankenstein,” and Ian McKellen competed for best actor for his sly performance as Mr. Whale in the 1998 biopic “Gods and Monsters.” Shockingly, Alfred Hitchcock never won a best director award. Although he was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1968, he was nominated for this mother of a creepfest. He lost to Billy Wilder for “The Apartment,” which also beat “Psycho” for best black and white art direction. Janet Leigh was in the hunt for best supporting actress, but perhaps because her part was cut so short, she was passed over in favor of Shirley Jones in “Elmer Gantry.” That film’s lead, Burt Lancaster, took home the best actor prize for his portrayal of the titular charlatan. Despite his daring, gender-fluid turn as Norman Bates, Anthony Perkins wasn’t among the finalists. John L. Russell’s brilliant cinematography was recognized but judged inferior to Freddie Francis’ work in “Sons and Lovers.” Most horrifying: Bernard Herrmann’s slashing score wasn’t considered sharp enough to earn a nomination. Maybe the devil made them do it? The Academy snubbed this satanic satire from Roman Polanski, choosing not to nominate it for best picture or director, both of which were won by Carol Reed’s more upbeat “Oliver!” Mia Farrow’s affecting, tremulous work as the mother of the devil’s spawn was left out of the best actress race, which ended in a tie between Barbra Streisand for “Funny Girl” and Katharine Hepburn for “The Lion in Winter.” That royal saga’s screenplay, by James Goldman, bested Mr. Polanski’s adaptation of Ira Levin’s novel. “Rosemary’s Baby” found favor only in the best supporting actress category, where 72-year-old Ruth Gordon snagged the prize for her hysterical portrayal of a buttinsky neighbor who leads a coven of Upper West Side witches. The opening line of Ms. Gordon’s acceptance speech, “I can’t tell you how encouraging a thing like this is,” brought down the house. It’s enough to make your head spin. What could have possessed the Academy to spurn the director William Friedkin’s terrifying tale of a pea soup-spewing little girl played by Linda Blair in favor of George Roy Hill’s con-men comedy, “The Sting,” for best picture, director, art direction and editing? William Peter Blatty did win for adapting his own novel into a screenplay, but he didn’t have to compete with “The Sting,” which fell into the original screenplay category. Ms. Blair lost best supporting actress to a less demonic youngster, Tatum O’Neal, for “Paper Moon,” while Ellen Burstyn, who played Ms. Blair’s mother, was defeated for best actress by Glenda Jackson for “A Touch of Class.” “The Exorcist” did win for best sound, and I can offer personal testimony as to its effectiveness. I was too young to see the movie while it was in theaters, but when I was in junior high school, I tried to watch it on HBO — except my family didn’t subscribe to the channel, so I could see only scrambled images. Still, the sound alone scared the bejesus out of me — to the point where I never watched the film until I was assigned this story. The horror, the horror! Where was Johnny — er, Jack — on Oscar night when Stanley Kubrick’s loose interpretation of Stephen King’s haunted-hotel novel was eligible? Nowhere to be seen. The ceremony was dominated by “Ordinary People,” which won best picture, a best director award for Robert Redford, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Timothy Hutton. Robert De Niro knocked out voters for best actor in “Raging Bull” and Thelma Schoonmaker won for best editing. The Academy dug Sissy Spacek’s take on Loretta Lynn in “Coal Miner’s Daughter” for best actress. Mr. Polanski’s version of Thomas Hardy’s “Tess” cleaned up in the categories of cinematography, art direction and costume design. “The Shining” did earn the dubious distinction of garnering two Razzie nominations: Shelley Duvall for worst actress and Mr. Kubrick for worst director. It’s almost enough to make you want to commit redrum.",5912
5a95be68410cf7000162e474,2018-02-27T20:24:03+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/arts/music/the-stone-john-zorn-new-school.html,Culture,"By 8 p.m. last Thursday night, a line of about 100 people had amassed along Avenue C, outside the Stone, and John Zorn was eager to get the 8:30 show started early. He sent a volunteer down to the basement, where the evening’s performers were assembled, to address a lack of microphones. “Make a deal,” he barked. “Either the cello or the piano has to lose a mic.” He huddled with his other helpers, strategizing about how to wedge as many people as possible into the little room. Then he flung the front door open, and in the people came. “It’s $20 a person,” he called, as he had countless times before. “Have your money out and ready.” Mr. Zorn, 64, a storied alto saxophonist and movement-builder on New York’s downtown scene, was preparing for one of the last shows at the Stone’s gruffly enchanting Alphabet City location. (It closed on Sunday.) Most artist-run spaces like this live in dog years, so the fact that the Stone has been around for 13 human ones has allowed it to achieve legendary status on New York’s cultural outlands. Not many well-known albums have been recorded there — though some that ought to be known better certainly have — but it’s fostered more than its share of combustible creativity. The Stone has held the line for a kind of music presenting that prizes direct engagement, allowing improvisers and audiences to meet each other head-on, sharing in the work of building whatever it is — energy, focus, faith, chimera — that comprises a musical performance. But wait. Before we deliver the eulogy, the Stone isn’t closing. It’s only moving. Starting this week, the venue will be headquartered in an elegant “glass box” theater on the ground floor of the New School, a university on the northern rim of Greenwich Village. It will host five concerts a week, with each week serving as a residency for a chosen artist, in accordance with longtime Stone policy. In Mr. Zorn’s estimation, and that of many others, the move marks a step up. “We’re not moving because of any sinister reason,” he said last week over breakfast at Russ and Daughters Cafe, a short walk from the Stone’s old location. “We’re moving simply because it was time for a change. I went in there one day and I said, ‘You know, I think we can do a little better than this.’” You can see where he’s coming from: In summers, the old Stone often bore an unnameable smell. And in all seasons, sirens from the avenue tended to smear the sound of the performances. The odorless New School location has a fabulous grand piano and neatly curtained walls. The Stone has been wetting its feet there by presenting shows Friday and Saturday nights since June, and the few weekends I’ve been to the new space, it has appeared to foster the kind of open exchange that typified most nights on Avenue C. I’ve already heard startlingly successful group improvisations, and first-time bands of unlikely collaborators that gamely fell flat. All of this is as it should be. But the move does mark a perilous entry into academe, something that Mr. Zorn had long resisted — and something that, more often than not, musicians of his cohort haven’t had the opportunity to resist. When Mr. Zorn opened the Stone in 2005, he was seeking a respectful home for the ardent, unconditional music that his community of free improvisers had been making since the 1970s. (The music’s roots actually coil back to the 1950s, when free jazz was born and John Cage helped lay some of the groundwork for minimalism). Most of the venues that welcomed these so-called creative musicians were dive bars and semiofficial studios or living spaces. Most could hardly stay afloat. The ones that could, like the Knitting Factory and Tonic, eventually scaled up, meaning they expected larger crowds that would patronize the bar. So Mr. Zorn consulted Ela Troyano, a filmmaker who owns the building at Avenue C and East Second Street, and he opened a one-room venue on its ground floor. He paid rent with the revenue from monthly benefit concerts, philanthropic donations and album sales on his Tzadik label. “To have a space that’s completely run and curated by musicians was unusual,” said the guitarist Mary Halvorson, who moved to New York a few years before the Stone opened, and has played there regularly ever since. “It really gave musicians an opportunity to workshop new material, and also to try out things that they might not try normally,” she added. “You really felt like the audience was there with you.” Last Thursday, almost a dozen performers, varying widely in age and stature, took turns improvising in groups of two or three or four. Laurie Anderson and Laura Ortman played bright, arcing lines on their violins as the electronic musician Jad Atoui made slow, mushrooming palls underneath. Later, the guitarist Nels Cline and the pianist Sylvie Courvoisier joined Mr. Zorn for a short sortie. It began with a scraping, aggro spill, but then Ms. Courvoisier started hammering a high note with both hands, at top velocity but medium volume; she was seizing the room’s ears, and thinning out the trio’s sound. Mr. Zorn and Mr. Cline relaxed into a vigilant consensus behind her. All along, no one in the room spoke a word. Mr. Zorn feels confident he can carry the same spirit of attentive rapture into the New School. “I prefer staying out of the academy,” he said. “I think there’s something very beneficial about getting together and just playing: doing concerts, organizing it yourself, talking over lunches about music, getting deep into things.” But he said he was impressed by Richard Kessler, the New School’s executive dean for the performing arts, whom Mr. Zorn had known as a trombonist on the classical and new music scenes in the 1980s. For his part, Mr. Kessler sees the Stone as an element of a broader effort to upend the way the performing arts are taught. He wants to make the New School a home for the avant-garde, and for the spirit of artistic entrepreneurship that has always gone along with it, without corrupting the source material. The Stone’s house rules — no drinks, largely volunteer staff, all door money to the musicians — will remain in place. “I think what John and many of his artists do is where I want education to go,” Mr. Kessler said. Mr. Zorn said Mr. Kessler and the school’s provost, Tim Marshall, made him feel assured that the Stone’s unmediated ethic could survive. When Mr. Zorn rejected a lengthy contract drawn up by the New School’s legal team, Mr. Marshall agreed to effectuate their agreement with just a handshake. “Pretty cool,” Mr. Zorn said approvingly. There’s reason to believe that Mr. Zorn’s experiment at the New School will yield fresh results, without annulling its old identity. Meanwhile, the Stone is expanding its footprint in other ways. Ms. Halvorson, the guitarist, is scheduled to teach a three-hour Stone Workshop this Wednesday as part of a monthly series of master classes that Mr. Zorn is organizing at the New School. He also recently started curating monthly concerts at Russ and Daughters Cafe and at National Sawdust in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. And he is entertaining the idea of opening another Stone-like venue somewhere else in Lower Manhattan, this time with a bar. For now, though, his main focus is on the New School. On Sunday night, as the last notes to be played at the old Stone settled into the dust, Mr. Zorn was characteristically succinct. “Say good night to the Stone,” he called out, his alto saxophone resting in his palm. “We’ll be at the New School starting Tuesday.”",7529

Using an ice pick from his own kitchen, he went through the eye sockets into the brain of his patient, a 29-year-old severely depressed housewife, and cut into her frontal lobes. Then he sent her home in a cab. The history of mental illness treatments reveals medicine at its most inventive, desperate and disturbing. There have been awe-inspiring discoveries — of the healing properties of lithium, for example, a soft, silvery metal produced in the first 20 minutes after the Big Bang. But remedies generally seem to have run a narrow gamut from the unpleasant (Cotton Mather’s prescription for depression: “living swallows, cut in two, and laid hot reeking unto the shaved Head”) to the outright sadistic. Aside from Freeman’s lobotomies, there is a long tradition of poisoning patients or inducing comas to “reset” the brain. In one notorious treatment, turpentine was injected into a patient’s abdominal wall in the hope of encouraging a fever high enough to burn away her hallucinations. We’re lucky to live in more evidence-based, scientific times. Or do we? In “Blue Dreams,” a capacious and rigorous history of psychopharmacology, the psychologist and writer Lauren Slater looks at the fact that despite our ravenous appetite for psychotropic medications (about 20 percent of Americans take some psychotropic drug or other), doctors don’t really understand how they work or how to assess if a patient needs them. In the case of antidepressants, two-thirds of patients taking an S.S.R.I. (Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa, etc.) would improve on a placebo alone. Still the misconception that depression is a matter of “low serotonin” persists. “There is no proof that a depressed person has a chemical imbalance,” Slater writes. “When you choose nevertheless to put that person on a medication that will alter neurotransmitter levels in his or her brain, then in effect you are causing a chemical imbalance rather than curing one.” None of this is news, or should be. “Blue Dreams” arrives in the thick of a debate about the pharmaceutical approach to mental health, and synthesizes forceful critiques from Gary Greenberg, Irving Kirsch and Robert Whitaker, among others. Slater is pithy, readable and generally fair, although I wish she had engaged more thoroughly with the defense of antidepressants, mounted perhaps most persuasively by Peter D. Kramer in his recent book “Ordinary Well,” which explored flaws in the studies that examined the efficacy of antidepressants. The real strength of this book comes from Slater’s very particular position. She is patient and psychologist, part of the first wave of people who were prescribed Prozac in the 1980s. She describes how, in the years since, her mind has been saved and her body destroyed. For 35 years, Slater has taken one psychotropic medication or the other. Her 1988 book “Prozac Diary” documented the relief that medication brought her, at the age of 26. She’d long been suicidal and suffered from eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and a depression so crippling, she was hospitalized five times between the ages of 13 and 24. Prozac “hurled me to heaven,” she writes in “Blue Dreams.” “I lived a gilded life, rich and buttery, producing books and babies as fast as I could, because I knew the Prozac would wear off, and eventually it did.” She found another drug cocktail that eased her symptoms. But at 54, she writes, “my body is in the shape of an octogenarian with issues.” Her memory is shot. The antipsychotic she takes causes insatiable hunger and her weight has ballooned. She has diabetes. Her kidneys are failing. Her feet are covered in weeping sores and her eyesight is in trouble. The drug Slater relies on is called Zyprexa. Curiously enough it’s the same drug Andrew Solomon described taking almost 20 years ago, in his National Book Award-winning history of depression, “The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression.” He writes of the relief and anguish the drug brought him with eerie similarity, of having to choose his mind over his body. What accounts for this sluggish progress, these intolerable bargains? There’s a “dry pipeline of new drugs,” the psychotherapist Gary Greenberg wrote in The New Yorker, “an indication that the drug industry has begun to lose faith in the myth it did so much to create.” Looking to the future, Slater seems to find hope in the “drugs not discovered but rediscovered”: in the encouraging studies of psychedelics and depression. “Blue Dreams,” like all good histories of medicine, reveals healing to be art as much as science. Slater doesn’t demonize the imperfect remedies of the past or present — even as she describes their costs with blunt severity. And, improbably perhaps, she ends on a note of hope, calling these early efforts to address mental illness “the first golden era.” If the story of the magic bullet of psychopharmacology is coming to an end, another story — a potentially better one, Slater believes — is coming to take its place.",5082
5a95a4bd410cf7000162e433,2018-02-27T18:34:31+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/arts/television/looming-tower-review-hulu.html,Culture,"When recent history gets turned into television drama, there’s usually a book involved. The budgets for current series about the Waco siege, the killing of Gianni Versace and the unsolved murders of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. all include the rights to a nonfiction tome, or several. The same is true — and how — of “The Looming Tower,” the new 10-episode mini-series on Hulu. The show didn’t get made only because of the events it covers, now nearly 17 years in the past. It got made because of the book itself: Lawrence Wright’s definitive and mesmerizing “The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,” the best seller and Pulitzer Prize winner published in 2006. Sales and prizes, though, are no guarantee that a book will make it to the screen with its spirit intact. Neither, apparently, is the involvement of the author. (Mr. Wright, who had already used the work as the basis of a one-man stage show, gets writing and producing credits on the series.) By reputation, the book is about the failure of America’s intelligence and law enforcement agencies to stop the Sept. 11 attacks. And that story — the head-smacking inability of the C.I.A. and F.B.I. to share information and put together an abundance of clues — is there. But about 80 percent of Mr. Wright’s text didn’t involve Americans. It was about, and told from the point of view of, Middle Easterners — not just Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda colleague Ayman al-Zawahri, but a legion of jihadists, politicians, rulers, clerics, teachers, wives and daughters. It largely traced not how America failed but how and why a small group of Islamists succeeded, starting with why they hated America so much. Based on the first three episodes of “The Looming Tower” (which begin streaming on Wednesday), Mr. Wright, working with the writer Dan Futterman and the director Alex Gibney, has reduced the story to that other 20 percent. The result is a crisp, quickly paced and essentially ordinary crime procedural, with a surprising amount of fictionalization for dramatic effect and narrative convenience. The show reverses the balance of perspective from the book: A pair of F.B.I. agents, John O’Neill (Jeff Daniels) and Ali Soufan (Tahar Rahim), replace bin Laden and Zawahri as the central characters, and the point of view is firmly American. The series opens with a standard espionage thriller scene, the clandestine daisy-chain transport of a computer hard drive, that doesn’t appear in the book, where Mr. Wright is matter-of-fact in his descriptions of spycraft. Other inventions are more problematic. A hookup between an F.B.I. agent and an American diplomat (both fictitious) is thrown in just to squeeze some tears. And a heroic act that in real life was performed by a dying Kenyan, during the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, is shifted to a dying American. Cutting out 50 years of the story and most of the cast of characters (the book begins in the 1940s with the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb; the show skips decades of Arab history and opens in 1998) allows more time for fiction-friendly details. In the book, Mr. Wright gives a few pages to the Mr. O’Neill’s byzantine romantic life, as a counterpoint to Islamist attitudes toward women and sex. This gets a fuller, but (so far) less relevant treatment on screen. “The Looming Tower” is not alone in favoring a detective story over ideas and import. “Manhunt: Unabomber,” “Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G.” and “Waco,” to cite current or recent examples, all do it to some degree. (Though Paramount Network’s “Waco” has gained depth in its later episodes, with the Branch Davidians captive inside their compound.) “The Looming Tower” does benefit from good performances, including those of Mr. Rahim, Peter Sarsgaard as a querulous C.I.A. agent (seemingly based on the real-life Michael Scheuer) and Bill Camp as an F.B.I. gumshoe (a composite of New York-based agents). Mr. Daniels is fun to watch, but his Midwestern affability and natural courtliness don’t match up at all with the book’s description of O’Neill. (He’s also 15-plus years older than O’Neill was at the time.) In 2018, “The Looming Tower” sits in an odd place. So much has happened since the events it depicts that it feels like ancient history. But so much has happened — and continues to happen — precisely because of the events it depicts, that the book now feels unequal to its task. Perhaps turning it into a sentimental cop show was the only sensible approach.",4509

These symbols stand for values including initiative, appreciation and connection, as well as for such physical essentials as movement and nutrition. Mr. Dauchan takes us though each of these, step by step, with some highly imaginative, homemade visual and aural aids. By the way, Mr. Dauchan’s character is not Brobot Johnson, or not exactly. The amiable alien who presides as D.J. and M.C. over this production, which is directed by Andrew Scoville, is named Flobot Owens. He has arrived by a time-traveling spaceship named the LL Cool J, which resembles a boom box “the size of a Winnebago.” Brobot Johnson is the figure (also embodied by Mr. Dauchan) who appears in video projections, moving among the human citizens of New York, on the walls of the spaceship into which the Bushwick Starr has been transformed. Oh, and Mr. Dauchan also shows up as a wacky, wild-haired professor, who is apparently a font of cosmic knowledge. At least, I think that’s the case. There’s no doubt that Mr. Dauchan has devised an intricate history, philosophy, technology and civilization for his robot alter egos, as elaborate as anything from “Dr. Who.” But since he delivers the specifics of this back story in tongue-tripping hip-hop incantations, underscored by layered astral music and sound effects, I can’t swear that I got even the basic details right. Still, Mr. Dauchan isn’t out to engage your inner sci-fi nerd, or not the part of it that quibbles over interplanetary communication systems. Instead, he’s addressing the trusting, hopeful children buried somewhere within all so-called adults. That includes the plaid-shirted, mountain-booted hipsters in the audience at my show, who turned as gleefully pliable as young’uns dancing to the Pied Piper’s piping. You may even find yourself thinking of Mr. Dauchan as a rapping Mr. Rogers, teaching basic good manners, values and survival skills to the rudderless overgrown kids of the 21st century. Like Mr. Rogers, Flobot Owens uses ditties, snacks, toys and group participation exercises as instructional tools. This means that you will be asked to chant, wave your arms, hold your neighbors’ hands, brandish colorful glow sticks, dance and high-five your robot host. You are also encouraged to call out “I love you, Flobot” when the mood strikes you. And it may strike you. From the moment he enters, wreathed in stage smoke, Mr. Dauchan radiates that natural, magnetic affability you associate with successful stand-up comics and talk-show hosts, but without any of the underlying hostility or aggression. As a consequence, his audience seems not just willing but eager to place its collective dignity in his illuminated hands. The show’s spaceship-cum-classroom set (designed by Raul Abrego) may remind you of a more sophisticated version of the intergalactic fantasy lands you created as personal playhouses as a grade-schooler. It is definitely a safe space. There, you are told, if you listen hard, you can hear the astral sound of “peace between species.” And without realizing it, you may even find you’ve regressed to a forgotten point in your life when you believed that goodness was the dominant human instinct and that anybody, even an alien, was a potential friend.",4632
5a9590ce410cf7000162e3f6,2018-02-27T17:09:28+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/arts/dance/jennifer-lawrence-red-sparrow-kurt-froman-isabella-boylston.html,Culture,"For a quick six minutes in the new film “Red Sparrow,” Jennifer Lawrence is a ballerina. It’s hard won. Transforming Ms. Lawrence into a credible ballet dancer — a Bolshoi prima, no less — required a dance dream team, which came in the form of the talented choreographer Justin Peck; Ms. Lawrence’s handsome partner, the Ukrainian dancer Sergei Polunin; and her dance double, the stellar American Ballet Theater principal Isabella Boylston. But first, Ms. Lawrence needed a teacher. Kurt Froman, a former member of New York City Ballet who worked with Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis on “Black Swan,” may not be on a non-dance fan’s radar, but he was the coach that people in ballet and Hollywood knew could make Ms. Lawrence spring into dancing shape. “I love feeling like an ambassador to my art form,” Mr. Froman said in an interview. “In the past when you saw dance misrepresented, you’d get this kind of cringe, because you’d feel like, God, if only someone had suggested something a little more legitimate they could have pulled this off.” “Red Sparrow,” which opens on Friday, may not be a dance movie, but ballet — its single-mindedness — permeates it. In this dark spy thriller, directed by Francis Lawrence and based on the 2013 novel of the same name by Jason Matthews, Ms. Lawrence plays Dominika Egorova, a Russian ballerina who has to retire from the stage — and here comes a spoiler, which is easier to read about than to watch — after her partner leaps into the air and crashes onto her leg. It’s a career-ender. Forced to become a spy whose specialty is the art of seduction, Dominika finds that her ballet past helps. She has discipline, athleticism, ambition. She knows how to act. For Mr. Lawrence, who is not related to Ms. Lawrence but has directed her in three “Hunger Games” films, having his star engage in intense ballet training wasn’t only about dancing. It helped to define her character. The opening scene showcases Mr. Peck’s ballet, performed by members of the Hungarian National Ballet and inspired by “The Firebird.” (The dance scenes were shot at the Hungarian State Opera House in Budapest.) Instead of using Stravinsky’s timeless music, it is set to an original score by James Newton Howard. “Justin was the creative collaborator, and Kurt was the one who took on the physical aspects of really working with Jen,” Mr. Lawrence said. (Ms. Lawrence also worked with the Russian ballet coach Olga Kostritzky.) Mr. Froman is “the ballet-boot-camp guy, and in a great way,” Mr. Lawrence said. “He knows how to teach ballet to lay people, to ease them in as best as possible.” And he knows their limits, Mr. Lawrence added. “He was the one who told me: ‘Jen will never get up on pointe. It’s too dangerous.’ ” Ms. Lawrence has danced before on film, memorably in a duet with Bradley Cooper in “Silver Linings Playbook.” But while it was a delight, the number, despite a couple of harrowing lifts, had little in common with ballet. Though only Ms. Lawrence’s upper body is what is shown in the “Red Sparrow” sequence, she learned all of the choreography, which, Mr. Froman said, was not created with a beginner in mind. She had to hit the rise and fall of the movement, essentially matching Ms. Boylston — if not in quality then in dynamics and with the correct épaulement, or the placement of the shoulders. Over the course of three and a half months, Mr. Froman worked with Ms. Lawrence — mainly in her garage in Los Angeles — for four hours a day, five days a week. They started with stretching and working with discs to help Ms. Lawrence grasp turnout, or the opening of the legs from the hips. “I wanted her to understand what muscle groups were involved, and how most people walking on the street are internally rotated with their shoulders — their palms are facing back,” Mr. Froman said. “With ballet dancers, you have to spin that back so it looks more like their arms are an extension of their back, and that whole alignment lengthens your neck. It widens your shoulder line.” Mr. Froman made her hold a ball to bring awareness to her arm. “When there’s weight in it and when you’re activating those fingers, it’s different than just having your arm as a prop or lifeless,” he said. “By the time we started working on choreography, she had beautiful hands and a really nice neck and shoulders.” And he didn’t make the exercises easy. “Even for an actor, they have to understand this world,” he said. “It’s almost like a religion. Every day there’s a checklist going through your head: Where’s my center of gravity? Are my ribs closed?” During the filming, Mr. Froman stood behind the camera facing Ms. Lawrence instead of using a microphone as he talked her through the movement. “I wanted it to to be just between the two of us,” he said. “Immediately, she performed exactly the quality of work that we had rehearsed. It didn’t all go out the window because of nerves.” In the end, the ballet sequence relies on visual effects, with a combination of shots featuring Ms. Lawrence and Ms. Boylston. Mr. Polunin, who plays Dominika’s dance partner, said Ms. Lawrence possessed “a ballerina’s energy.” “It’s different than what a normal person has,” he said. “There’s a tight feeling inside. It’s the muscle compression and wanting to be perfect. She had that.” After Sarah Lane, then a Ballet Theater soloist, performed as Ms. Portman’s dance double in “Black Swan,” a controversy erupted; Ms. Lane didn’t feel she was getting the credit she deserved and went public. Why would Ms. Boylston, a ballerina at the top of her game, want to be a dance double? She wanted to work with Mr. Peck, she said, adding, “any opportunity to help bring ballet to a larger audience is something to be capitalized on.” Mr. Lawrence said he never wanted to hide that they were using a double, “and stand around in interviews going, ‘No, no no — Jen did all the training herself.’ ” Mr. Froman realized that dancing next to Ms. Boylston could make just about anyone feel vulnerable. Ms. Lawrence “trusted the fact that I would tell her something didn’t look good or not,” Mr. Froman said. “I’m at my happiest working with a dancer or an actor — I want it to feel participatory, I want it to feel collaborative, and I want to hear their ideas,” he said. “I’m in this line of work to give it away and to empower. I had to be there for Jen.”",6356
5a95887f410cf7000162e3da,2018-02-27T16:34:02+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/movies/did-you-wonder-who-fired-the-gun-review.html,Culture,"In “The Fire Next Time,” James Baldwin wrote that “to accept one’s past — one’s history — is not the same thing as drowning in it.” He knew that the superstitious fear of being swallowed up, the dread of giving up a fantasy of innocence, is precisely what keeps so many white Americans from confronting the uglier aspects of the nation’s legacy. Travis Wilkerson, a documentary filmmaker whose roots are in small-town Alabama, attempts just such a reckoning in “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” The movie, a scorching and rigorous essay on memory and accountability, is neither a profession of guilt nor a performance of virtue. Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power. The focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson’s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer. “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann’s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Monáe’s “Hell You Talmbout” and Phil Ochs’s “William Moore.” That song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film’s title and a part of its wider cultural context. “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director’s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive. Mr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include “An Injury to One” and “Far From Afghanistan,” dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from “To Kill a Mockingbird” provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck’s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy. Instead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn’t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather’s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, “Southern secessionist” group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge. The bitterness of “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” is hard to swallow, but also bracing, like a shot of strong liquor that leaves you with a clearer head and sharper senses. The movie is an antidote to the lethal innocence that, as Baldwin and others have pointed out, allows the crimes of racism to remain unpunished and often unacknowledged.",4397

That huge temporal imbalance seems like a problem, yet if you listen to many choreographers and dancers, you get the sense that just scheduling more performances wouldn’t solve everything. These artists often imply that the process, not the product, is the most valuable part of their work — at least to them. Performances, by these lights, are more like peepholes. Is there a way to widen the aperture? This appears to be the goal of the “The Making Room,” a project led by the veteran choreographer Bebe Miller. At New York Live Arts last week, she and her esteemed colleague Susan Rethorst each presented a new piece on a shared program. So far, so ordinary. But Ms. Miller’s company also unveiled a website — themakingroom.org — that gives the public access to more of the making. The access we get isn’t equal. Over the course of two years, the two choreographers operated largely independently, and the text and video clips on the website offer much less of Ms. Rethorst’s process than that of Ms. Miller, whose company organized the project. We see bits of Ms. Miller’s rehearsals and in-progress showings, source material and improvisations, experiments that yield discoveries or don’t, and lots of stuff (including dancers) that didn’t make it into the performed piece. Clicking around, you can get a decent feel for what Ms. Miller and her dancers do with their time, and for the collective exploration that matters to them. That’s much less true of the pages devoted to Ms. Rethorst. But the project has a third element: three occasions on which the choreographers met and compared notes. And here Ms. Rethorst’s participation is crucial. As she demonstrated in her 2012 book “A Choreographic Mind,” Ms. Rethorst is uncommonly skilled at articulating how her kind of choreographer thinks. She’s a straight talker, too. She’s the one, on the website, who suggests that all this exposure of process might be more interesting to the participants than to audience members. Compared with her writing, Ms. Rethorst’s aperçus on the site aren’t as fully formed. Neither are Ms. Miller’s, and it’s a little frustrating to watch revelations spark and fade. What’s most illuminating is to witness these two contemporaries (they both danced in Nina Wiener’s company in the mid-1970s), each long accustomed to doing her own thing, observe and comment on the other’s approach. The divergences bring out their distinctiveness. Ms. Miller is all about asking — of a gesture or movement — “What is this?” She and her dancers consider the question together, bringing up associations, memories, movies. Ms. Rethorst, by contrast, would never ask that question. “It is what it is,” she says. She knows what she wants, even if she keeps changing her mind. This difference was somewhat discernible in the two pieces at New York Live Arts. Ms. Rethorst’s “Stealing from Myself” stitches together parts of earlier works. (It might have been nice if the website clued us in to the sources.) As she explained in a post-show discussion, the work uses music in a filmic way, to impose mood. Yet the choreography doesn’t impose an interpretation. Two people (Gregory Holt and the radiant Gabrielle Revlock) seem to be in a silent play of found gestures quilted together. A whimsical, slapstick quality might turn sinister, but what holds your attention is the specificity. It is what is. Ms. Miller’s “In a Rhythm” is altogether more elaborate. With easy authority, she verbally introduces her strong cast of six, tells us about David Foster Wallace and Toni Morrison, and explains her interest in syntax. The dance is many disparate things put side by side, a structure that the website reveals as both aesthetic preference and practical reaction (which dancers are available when). Irresistible music (“Brick House,” Donny Hathaway) oozes in and is then ripped away like a rug, or like the rugs that serve as set and sometimes costumes. It’s a rich stew, with the suggestive power of its juxtapositions unfixed, yet especially in the context of “The Making Room,” it raises the question of how many doors of entry a dance needs. The website raises the same question, differently. Yet ultimately the site isn’t a tool to understand better these particular dance works. It’s an imperfect portal into these choreographers’ ways of working, for those who have the time.",4451

Written by E. Max Frye and directed with verve by Paco Cabezas, this week’s episode was the show’s best to date, by far. It begins and ends with strong, disturbing images of death: a pale horse, lying dead on the cobblestone as street kids pass by; in closing, we see an eyeless young boy, abducted from the brothel where he worked, murdered and deposited at the feet of the Statue of Liberty. In between, Dr. Laszlo Kreizler and his team secure Commissioner Teddy Roosevelt’s help in a pair of sting operations to catch the boy’s killer. They divide themselves into teams of two, lying in wait as the young Stevie, Kreizler’s ward, dresses in uncomfortable drag in an attempt to lure the murderer into their clutches. After a tense false start on the Feast of the Ascension, the plan works on Pentecost. Stevie is approached by the murderer, and his momentarily distracted minders, John Moore and Marcus Isaacson, spring into action. The killer flees, guns are drawn, bullets fly and a casualty is incurred as Kreizler’s driver, Cyrus, is struck down by the suspect. But this last bit is just a distraction, as Moore and Kreizler realize in horror when they look across the street and see an open window into a now-empty room in the brothel they had just been staking out. Stevie is safe, but one of the real child prostitutes they were attempting to protect is gone. Forever. Alternately thrilling and heartbreaking, the sequence is “The Alienist” at its best. Whatever happens next, at least we now know for a fact that the team can rule out Willem Van Bergen as a suspect — not least of all because dead men can’t kill. While Kreizler and company pursued the murderer from brothel to rooftop and back, the silver-toothed scion of privilege and known pedophile — who’s been protected by everyone from his mother to the mayor to J.P. Morgan to the police department brass — met his end at the barrel of the former captain Connor’s gun. Yes, that former captain Connor, the one who seemed so dedicated to the cover-up surrounding Van Bergen’s crimes that he continued to act in concert with the conspiracy even after his involvement cost him his job. Tipped off by an informant that Willem is back on the prowl — his parents had instructed him to board a ship to Buenos Aires, but the young and syphilitic dandy just can’t help himself — Connor intercepts him almost immediately. A chase ensues up the scaffolding of a bridge under construction, which is when we get tentative confirmation of Kreizler’s theory that Van Bergen is not the killer: The murderer routinely scales buildings to deposit the corpses of his pray; Van Bergen is clearly terrified of heights. If only he’d been as wary of ex-cops, he might have survived. When Connor and one of his minions corner Van Bergen at the edge of the structure, Willem starts whining and boasting of his immunity from prosecution, persecution and most certainly death; his family is from the 400, you see, and the likes of Connor wouldn’t dare touch him. Van Bergen’s sense of entitlement is so total, and so absurd, that I couldn’t help but say “whoops!” when a round from Connor’s revolver entered his brain. Bad break, buddy. Connor’s actions eliminate the story’s previous prime suspect, steering the plot through a sharp left turn. But those actions also take us on a journey deeper into the villain himself. Before tonight, the Captain came across as a racist, sexist, homophobic Irish cop stereotype who followed his corrupt orders with no questions asked. Now, he’s … well, he’s still a racist, sexist, homophobic Irish cop stereotype. But the following-orders part of Connor’s character got shot in the head and thrown off the bridge, right along with Willem Van Bergen. After Commissioner Roosevelt fired him for his role in having covered for young “Willie,” Connor seemed to realize that the rich creeps he had risked his career to protect had no interest in protecting him in turn. With the loss of that career comes the loss of all its perks, too: Imagine the indignity of suddenly having to pay a nickel for a beer instead of drinking it on the house — and getting called a “paddy” in the bargain. Now that he’s a civilian, he’s freer with his feelings about Van Bergen’s behavior, which he helped cover up but never condoned. Whatever the combination of causes, this is a man who’s fed up with doing his ungrateful paymasters’ dirty work. Willem never stood a chance — and Connor will be a much more interesting antagonist moving forward. Indeed, from top to bottom, characters are coming into their own. In their off-duty moments, the chemistry sparks and sizzles between Moore and Sara, on the one hand, and between Kreizler and his mute maid, Mary, on the other. When Mary cuts her finger while preparing the doctor’s dinner, Kreizler notices the injury and slowly unwraps the bandage; the eroticism of the act is unmistakable even before he licks his own finger and applies his saliva to her wound as a “natural coagulant.” Speaking of fingers, Sara’s later riff on why John would be a lousy typist is one big digit-based double entendre. “I think you lack dexterity — in your fingers, that is,” says. “All men do. That’s why they’ll never be any good at it.” I’m sorry, what were we talking about again? Their newfound, jokey rapport, aided by Moore’s sobriety, is a real pleasure to watch in action throughout the episode. Take the conversation in which Sara reveals that she’s been investigating Kreizler’s background to find out why he’s so prejudiced against fathers. (It seems likely his right arm was crippled by abuse and not caused by a congenital defect, as he has insisted.) “Perhaps you’re in love with him,” John says. “Perhaps I am,” Sara replies, smiling, before moving on. Both parties know they’re misdirecting each other from their romantic interest in each other, and both of them knowingly play along. The actors Dakota Fanning and Luke Evans are so low-key and likable in these roles: She’s all poise and quiet but with razor-sharp intelligence; he’s all charm and swagger that gives way to openhearted kindness and concern at a moment’s notice. These complementary qualities give warmth and heat to their slow burn. Those qualities also make their scenes with other characters crackle in unexpected and welcome ways. When John encounters Joseph at the local soda shop and later at the brothel, his mixture of pride and embarrassment over his own career as an illustrator — a gig Joseph views with incredulity — is genuinely endearing, as is his fatherly concern for the boy. And when Sara presses Kreizler on the truth about his arm, her relentlessness in search of the truth echoes Kreizler’s own. I think it is seeing himself in her that drives him to slap her into silence, more than anything else. It’s a shocking moment, and it’s cut short by the revelation that the killer is among them, and the discovery that despite their best efforts, he has killed again. But it’s a moment that works only because these characters are truly beginning to come alive.",7124

That story, in outline, is engaging. Azeem Bhatti (Sanjit De Silva) is up for a promotion at a bank in London. Though his parents are from Pakistan, English is his first language; he barely speaks Urdu. He dresses just like his Anglo colleagues, and trash talks with the best of them. If he hoists a glass of orange juice while they down their pints at the pub, and skips the meat at lunch when it isn’t halal, for the most part he passes as a regular lad and is thus unthreatening. Not that he’s happy about it. “In this country,” he explains bitterly to his wife, Saima, “a good Muslim is an invisible Muslim.” Yet he is even unhappier that Saima (Purva Bedi) wants to resolve her version of the same conflict more overtly and in public. Up for a promotion herself, she feels confident enough to start wearing the hijab at work, as she has recently started wearing it at home. When she is met with the inevitable blowback from bigots, Azeem tells her it’s her fault for dressing “like an Algerian asylum seeker.” The conflict between husband and wife, pressurized by their daily encounters with Islamophobia, is set within a larger family and historical context. Azeem and Saima live with Azeem’s parents, Akeel and Malika, who in their own way have played out the drama of deracination. Akeel (Ranjit Chowdhry) is old enough to have lived through two major emigrations, from India to Pakistan after the 1947 partition and from Pakistan to England in the 1950s. The first move cost his family its land and money, the second its status as part of the majority culture. During the decades of dead-end manual labor in London, Akeel often vented his accumulated frustration on Malika (Rita Wolf) and she in turn vented hers on their daughter, Javeria (Angel Desai). Set in 2011, “An Ordinary Muslim” considers the double bind facing those who wish to enjoy the opportunities of assimilation while also maintaining a connection to their traditions. Each path looks suspicious to those who favor the other. Azeem lurches back and forth, letting his frustrations at work infect his family life and vice versa. He ends up alienating white colleagues like his pal David (Andrew Hovelson) by telling them that their professed liberality is in fact more treacherous than bigotry. This is already a great deal for one play to shoulder, and I haven’t even mentioned the thread of the plot that considers the pressures on Azeem that come from within the Muslim community. (No single way of practicing his faith will please everyone.) As those pressures start to drag him down, his behavior becomes even more erratic — “You’ve gone from no Islam to Nation of Islam in five seconds,” Saima says — and the play’s point of view blurs. By the time it tries to connect Azeem’s personal crisis to the rise of Muslim extremist violence in the West, it has lost its ability to sustain an argument. The high-thread-count plot, the theme of moral confusion and the politico-economic framework that looms over the family drama are all hallmarks of the work of Tony Kushner, who mentored Mr. Chaudry as he worked on “An Ordinary Muslim.” And New York Theater Workshop, which produced Mr. Kushner’s “Homebody/Kabul” in 2001, has put its considerable expertise — and the strong director Jo Bonney — at the production’s disposal. Few first-time playwrights receive such support. But it wasn’t enough. “An Ordinary Muslim” is an important work still struggling to emerge from a text filled with freshman problems. The argumentative plot (Mr. Chaudry was studying to be a lawyer when the theater bug bit him) makes sense only for short stretches, after each of which the character logic seems to reset. Because the key conflicts are mostly described by unreliable narrators instead of enacted directly for us, they feel imposed or even doubtful. So even though everything about the play’s take on assimilation and racism is convincing in the abstract, nothing about the people experiencing it is. That isn’t the cast’s fault. No one could steer smoothly through all of Azeem’s hairpin turns, but Mr. De Silva is charismatic while trying. All of the others (including Sathya Sridharan and Harsh Nayyar as representatives of the local Muslim community) have strong moments too, and Ms. Wolf, as a mother who is somehow both amusing and terrifying, has nothing but. The production doesn’t help those strong moments hang together. Visually it seems to be caught between genres, unable to settle on domestic realism or Kushnerian poetics. (The set is by Neil Patel.) Ms. Bonney, who has staged thrilling productions of several recent plays by Suzan-Lori Parks, can do little but help this one move swiftly, though it seems to me it should have been shorter or longer than its two and a half hours. Plays are mysterious machines; even veteran playwrights find them hard to operate. The most promising thing about “An Ordinary Muslim” is the way its best moments seem to creep delicately out from under the rock of the author’s determination to make heavier points. In my favorite of these, Akeel, just when he seems ready to apologize to Malika for his lifetime of failures as a husband and father, suddenly switches from English to Urdu. Here Mr. Chaudry is using an inherently theatrical gesture to force an understanding, among the non-Urdu speakers in the audience anyway, that not everything true is universally comprehensible. And that, small as it is, is an earthshaking insight.",5936

On Monday, the painting-lined gallery hosted royalty of a different sort, when some of fashion’s biggest names met with Vatican luminaries to preview the exhibit “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,” which will open at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 10. Donatella Versace and Pierpaolo Piccioli, of Valentino, and the designers Thom Browne and Jean Charles de Castelbajac joined Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, at the Palazzo Colonna, where journalists got an early look at five of the 40 ecclesiastical garments and accessories that the Vatican is lending to the show. Ms. Wintour wore red and black, as did Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the Vatican’s de facto culture minister. Rewording the German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach’s well-known phrase, “Man is what he eats,” Cardinal Ravasi said that the same was true of how man dresses. “From the first pages of the Bible, God enters the scene certainly as a creator, but also as a tailor,” said the cardinal, citing a passage from Genesis where God made garments of skin for Adam and Eve and clothed them. “God himself worries about clothing his creatures, and this represents the genesis of the significance of clothing.” The items lent by the Vatican feature exquisitely crafted clothing and accessories, with intricate patchworks of gold and silver thread embroidery, as well as bejeweled tiaras and miters. Cardinal Ravasi noted that the liturgical vestment “represents above all the transcendent dimension, the dimension of the religious mystery, and that’s why it is ornate, because that which is divine is considered splendid, marvelous, sumptuous, grandiose.” He cited, as an example, the “marvelous chasubles,” or outermost vestments worn by clerics during mass, that Matisse designed for the Chapel of the Rosary in Vence, on the French Riviera, and that are today housed in the Vatican Museums’ collection of modern religious art. “When Picasso saw them, he said, ‘These aren’t sacred vestments, they are butterflies that fly in the sky of God,’” Cardinal Ravasi said. “And that is the real meaning of the sacred vestment.” Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s curator in charge, said some might consider fashion to be “an unfitting or unseemly medium by which to engage with ideas about the sacred or the divine.” “But dress is central to any discussion about religion,” he added, and “religious dress and fashion — at least in terms of their presentation — are both inherently performative.”",2706

In the fall, two plays by Samuel D. Hunter about the struggling descendants of the explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, “Lewiston” and “Clarkston,” will be performed together for the first time. Set at a fireworks factory in Idaho and a big-box store in Washington, the plays examine life in a country whose frontier has been completely settled. Davis McCallum, a longtime collaborator with Mr. Hunter, will direct. The following spring, “Lockdown” by Cori Thomas will receive its world premiere in a production directed by Kent Gash. Inspired by Ms. Thomas’s experiences with inmates at San Quentin State Prison in California, the play articulates the effects of long-term incarceration as a grieving writer agrees to draft a statement for an inmate’s parole hearing. “These plays are wrestling with what it means to be American today,” Daniella Topol, Rattlestick’s artistic director, said in a statement. “In what ways has the American dream left certain individuals behind? How do we overcome our emotional, physical and spiritual isolation? How do we relate to our families and how do we make our own communities?” Ms. Topol explained by phone that there is a connection between the themes of the plays and how they will be staged. For “Lewiston” and “Clarkston,” the theater’s seats and stage will be removed so that the cast and audience occupy a single space. And Rattlestick hopes to bring the production of “Lockdown” outside the theater to communities affected by mass incarceration. The theater also announced a number of other events in addition to its three main-stage productions. TheaterJam, a one-day theater festival, New Songs Now, a concert series, and previews of works in progress from Rattlestick’s apprentice company, Middle Voice, are all slated for the upcoming season, along with a weeklong festival of staged readings.",1960

The three-year M.F.A. program is a partnership with Trinity Rep, a Providence theater, and provides students with professional acting and directing experience in addition to classes. Alumnae include Laura Kepley, the artistic director of the Cleveland Play House, and Taibi Magar, who is currently directing the Off Off Broadway production “Is God Is,” a Times Critic’s Pick. The university hopes that removing the financial barrier will lead to more racial and economic diversity and allow aspiring creators to enter their careers debt-free. “I really think the key to diversifying the American theater is eliminating debt in arts education,” Patricia Ybarra, the chairwoman of Brown’s theater arts and performance studies department, said in a phone interview. The program’s tuition for the 2017-18 academic year was $52,231. Brown will cover the tuition of all current and future students beginning next fall; in order to fully cover the costs, the next class size will be reduced slightly to 10 students. (The class of 2019 has 15.) Ms. Ybarra said the decision is part of the university’s ongoing efforts involving the arts, diversity and eliminating loans: “It’s the synergy between those things that made this a top priority,” she said. The diversity of the program’s student body has increased over the last few years. According to data provided by the university, the acting and directing M.F.A. programs were made up of 25 percent students of color in 2014-15, compared to 42 percent in 2017-18. Ms. Ybarra said the university’s commitment to covering tuition is open-ended. “I assume we’re doing this forever,” she said. Brown is currently financially stable, with its endowment hitting a record high last year, valued at $3.5 billion.",1896

Such is the case with the still-officially-unsolved deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., Tupac and Biggie, gunned down six months apart two decades ago, a cruel extermination of hip-hop’s elite. They became martyrs, and also — as the years passed and their killers were never brought to justice — symbols of a kind of institutional neglect, failed originally by the genre they loved and, in death, by the police. So the most conspicuous aspect of “Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G.,” a lightly fictionalized 10-part limited series on USA that has its premiere on Tuesday, is its certainty. Here is a show that offers answers, a ticktock of the various investigations into the killings that have resulted in no arrests but not, if “Unsolved” is to be believed, in no answers. The series is inspired by “Murder Rap: The Untold Story of the Biggie Smalls & Tupac Shakur Murder Investigations,” a book by Greg Kading, who led a task force investigating the shootings in the late 2000s. (There is an accompanying documentary as well.) In that book, Mr. Kading lays out his theories about who pulled the triggers, and why. Yet somehow, seeing those theories brought to dramatized life — seven episodes were provided for review — gives them more power. “Unsolved” is equal parts appealingly pulpy and workmanlike, sometimes paced like a procedural and sometimes like a prestige drama. It weaves together three story lines — the friendship between Tupac (Marcc Rose) and Biggie (Wavyy Jonez), which soured and ultimately collapsed; the original L.A.P.D. investigation into Biggie’s murder, steered maniacally by the detective Russell Poole (Jimmi Simpson); and the task force convened a decade after the killings, helmed by Mr. Kading (Josh Duhamel). The love story here isn’t between Biggie and Tupac, though ample screentime is given over to their early friendship. It’s between the two detectives who never meet: Poole and Kading, who both begin to unravel in the face of a complex investigation, institutional pressure and family problems. In this telling, Poole is the true detective, wholly and distractingly absorbed by the case. Mr. Simpson plays him as an impatient savant, forever sternly exhaling and chafing against his superiors. (It should be noted, though, that in the “Murder Rap” documentary, Mr. Kading makes short work of Mr. Poole’s theories about the murders.) By contrast, Mr. Duhamel’s Kading is blank. Better is his extended team, which includes Daryn Dupree (a grounded Bokeem Woodbine) and Lee Tucker (Wendell Pierce, testy as ever). Mr. Jonez captures the gentle grandeur of Biggie (born Christopher Wallace), and Mr. Rose has Tupac’s familiar seductive glint in his eye. But this show about murdered rappers is really a cop show. What’s more, “Unsolved” did not secure licensing rights for either rapper’s music — though some lyrics are sprinkled into conversation — making them feel even more distant as subjects. In capturing the two investigations, though, “Unsolved” is effective in an unglamorous, no-frills way. And yet, as the episodes toggle between the ostentation of the hip-hop world and the grayness of police headquarters, it’s hard to overlook that a story of this historical significance is rendered in such proletarian fashion. Add to that the fact that Mr. Kading’s book and documentary were self-released, and that “Unsolved” isn’t on a vanity platform like HBO or Netflix, or delivered with the luxe production values of the “American Crime Story” series, but rather on USA, a basic cable staple. You would think that a show that advertises a convincing theory about these killings would be lavished with funding, be loudly publicized not just as art, but also as news. But instead, “Unsolved” remains in the shadows. Myth has a way of enduring.",3935
5a944d22410cf7000162e0e4,2018-02-26T18:08:26+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/books/review-tokyo-romance-ian-buruma.html,Culture,"The Dutch-born historian and New York Review of Books editor Ian Buruma spent several years in Tokyo when he was in his early 20s, and he picked up a nickname. Because “Buruma” sounds a bit like the word “bloomers” in Japanese, at least one acquaintance — Hijikata Tatsumi, the father of Butoh dance — called him Underpants or, for short, Pants. It was an affectionate sobriquet. The Japanese playwrights, dancers, film directors and actors who made up Buruma’s milieu in the mid-1970s adored him. He was exotic, a gaijin, as white as tofu. He was tall and good-looking and possessed a trace of bohemian glamour because it was known that his uncle was John Schlesinger, the director of “Midnight Cowboy.” Buruma had come to Tokyo on scholarship to study film. He was in flight from a pampered Dutch childhood that he describes, in his fond and artful if sometimes remote new memoir, “A Tokyo Romance,” as “a world of garden sprinklers, club ties, bridge parties and the sound of tennis balls in summer.” The Japanese art world put young Buruma to use. One Butoh troupe placed him onstage in a small scarlet jockstrap. While he struck a bodybuilder pose and the Tom Jones song “It’s Not Unusual” bellowed in the background, a modern ballet dancer writhed around him wearing only a “minuscule bikini bottom of sparkling silver.” One hopes Buruma is persuaded to reprise his half of this performance at New York Review holiday parties. He’s a self-deprecating man, the butt of every joke he tells. At the end of this performance his only job was to catch the dancer in his arms. To stunned silence in the audience, he dropped her. In another performance, Buruma stood onstage amid flying pork cutlets, a drag queen, a “dog god” and actors fighting over a placenta in a plastic bag. His role was to wear a leather cowboy hat and exclaim, on cue, “I am the Midnight Cowboy!” Buruma also appeared in not one but two Suntory whiskey ads, as if presaging Bill Murray’s sarcastically avuncular role in “Lost in Translation.” In one of these ads he appeared alongside Akira Kurosawa, the director of “Rashomon” and “Seven Samurai.” Buruma was, in other words, half male ingénue and half avant-garde Zelig during his Tokyo years. He was a bonhomous lurker. His memoir describes his intellectual and sexual coming-of-age. He fell in with a group of Western gay men, including the film historian Donald Richie, who were sexual exiles, able to live more freely in Japan than in the United States or England. They were Buruma’s charons into a raffish world of erotic cabarets and sex shows and carnival acts. The scenes flicker past as if lit by strobe lights: women urinating into plastic umbrellas held aloft by happy club patrons; sex in toilet stalls and in movie theaters; a girl who bites the heads off chickens; a man known as the Human Pump for his intricate regurgitation abilities. “I cannot imagine wanting to immerse oneself in another culture,” Buruma writes, “without feeling a sensual pull.” His own sexuality was still up for grabs. He had a Japanese girlfriend when he first moved to Tokyo. He dated other women, including nude dancers and a jazz singer “who belted out Peggy Lee numbers late at night for my benefit — why Peggy Lee, I don’t know.” In his pursuit of ravishment there were men as well. Buruma casts an emollient eye over the multiple and overlapping ways that he felt like an outsider in Japan. He often received special treatment as a gaijin, but just as often it was made clear to him that he would never get as close to this culture as he wanted. His own personality kept him between worlds. “Hovering on the fringes was where I liked to be, neither in nor out, neither one thing nor another, semidetached, a born fellow traveler, a male fag hag, an observer in the midst of sympathetic strangers.” Buruma is a keen observer and the owner of a well-provisioned mind. There are smart little junkets in this book into everything from Japanese movies (Buruma became a film critic for The Japan Times) to the country’s tattooing culture to its female elevator operators, about whom he made a documentary film. His prose is unflaggingly good. The experimental theater director Ritsaert ten Cate, for example, “had a face like an unmade bed: hooded eyes, loose cheeks, lips like two cuts of liver.” Buruma worked as an assistant to Magnum photographers while in Tokyo, and took his own photographs as well, many of which are printed in this book. You sense him in this memoir, like a photographer working in a darkroom, burning his memories here and dodging them there. There’s a good deal of dodging, one senses, in the area of his sexual experience, his desire to be both moth and flame. “A Tokyo Romance” is about Buruma’s desire to live life up to his nostrils, and clearly he has. For a book that is largely about extreme experience, in terms of art and life, he is perhaps overly discreet about his own emotions and behavior. Whenever you sense he is about to open a door, he instead drops you at the curb. It was P. G. Wodehouse, of all people, who asked, “What’s the use of a great city having temptations if fellows don’t yield to them?” Buruma did his share of yielding. He filed everything away. When he returned again to live in the West, his time in Tokyo led to magazine work and his first book contract. “Japan,” he writes, “was the making of me.”",5377

The two plays, presented in repertory at the Flea Theater explore a sense that too often falls by the wayside onstage — sound. Going to the theater, you would be forgiven for thinking only sight matters. Sound design is a stepchild that’s neglected at best, abused at worst. The mud coming out of speakers at too many Broadway shows, supposedly the apex of stagecraft, is appalling. Vision — ahem — is lacking when it comes to theatrical sound. Everybody knows you need to have it, but too many productions do not care all that much. Can the audience hear what the actors say? Good enough! What about playing songs during scene changes? My, what an inspired device! Are singers properly miked? Bring on the Tony! (Or not: It took until 2008 to have awards for sound design. The category was eliminated in 2014; it will be back for the 2018 edition, but voting will be restricted to a subset of expert voters — as if everyone else doesn’t have functioning ears.) The combo, which is presented by the theater company New Georges, radically departs from this cavalier approach. Audio helps tell the story in “Color”; in “Sound House,” it is the story. And both deal with female artists. Conceived and directed by Lily Whitsitt for the Door 10 company, “Color” provides each audience member with headphones that plug into the mind of Gertrude Stein (Christina Rouner). The technique, which is akin to the one adopted by Simon McBurney in his 2016 Broadway solo, “The Encounter,” creates a simultaneous sense of dislocation and intimacy. “Color,” which runs through March 3, focuses on a lesser known part of Stein’s life, when she and Alice B. Toklas (Stephanie Roth Haberle) were holed up in southern France during World War II. The godmother of modernism, Stein busied herself translating into English speeches by Marshal Philippe Pétain, the collaborator ruler of Vichy France. Ms. Whitsitt’s text incorporates lines from Stein’s 1916 play, “Mexico,” as well as from letters by the American playwright Thornton Wilder (Ben Williams, also the show’s sound designer) and Bernard Faÿ (Ean Sheehy), a Vichy sympathizer with fascist tendencies. Stein is a great choice for a sound-heavy show because she was a most musical writer, with her use of repetition, the literary equivalent of, say, Steve Reich’s loops or the incremental changes, in Terry Riley’s composition “In C.” Via incantation, the three artists aimed to change not just our perceptions but our very consciousness. Ms. Whitsitt attempts something similar here as her play shifts from cozy domesticity — Toklas cooks while Stein labors at her desk — to an unsettling descent into the writer’s inner world. The show liberally borrows from horror tropes: flickering lights, strange apparitions, people popping out of cupboards and a dense sonic environment incorporating everything from cicadas to tectonic grumblings to the crack of snapped necks as Toklas kills pigeons for dinner. In that last case, there are no birds on stage: Ms. Haberle is merely digging her thumbs into tomatoes. But we visualize something gruesome, and that is what lingers in the memory, anchored by one simple, queasy-making sound effect. The mood is considerably lighter in Stephanie Fleischmann’s whimsical, melancholy “Sound House,” which runs through March 4. The play puts in parallel the stories of one Constance Sneed (Susanna Stahlmann), a young contemporary woman, and the real-life Daphne Oram (Victoria Finney), who in 1959 left her job as a BBC studio manager to explore the nascent field of electronic music. Marsha Ginsberg’s set is strewn with artifacts such as a portable turntable, oscillators and proto-synthesizers, a reel-to-reel machine — remnants of a time when music-making and music-listening involved a physical rapport with cumbersome objects. The actors (who also include James Himmelsbach as Oram’s fictional former engineer, Horace Ohm) are miked so the sound designers Tyler Kieffer and Brandon Wolcott can manipulate their voices and integrate them into the audioscape. Constance and the composer often share the stage, but mostly remain in their respective timelines. The one question in the show, which is directed by Debbie Saivetz, is how these arcs will meet. There is something Tom Stoppard-esque about the era-hopping intermingling of reality, fiction and art. But the elusive link proves anticlimactic when it finally emerges, and even at a mere 90 minutes the evening wears out its welcome. A problem is that despite Ms. Stahlmann’s warm, quietly quirky performance, Constance pales besides the intriguing Oram, who created an “Oramics” machine that combined sound and visuals — something the show might be trying to evoke with synchronized dance-like movement (by Brendan Spieth), only to drop the device halfway through. Still, as flawed as these two shows are, it is refreshing to see them try to use technology to refresh theatricality. Let more follow suit and bend our ear, in the best sense of the term.",5110
5a944356410cf7000162e0c8,2018-02-26T17:26:41+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/arts/music/review-vienna-philharmonic-dudaemel-carnegie-hall.html,Culture,"For someone like me, who had not crossed paths much with the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel since his early appearances in New York more than a decade ago, his three concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall over the weekend held considerable fascination. What sort of chemistry might have developed between a once-brash wunderkind, now 37, and one of Old Europe’s most august ensembles? There was, for one thing, the matter of Leonard Bernstein, the quintessential New York maestro and a sort of Dudamel archetype, born a century ago this year. After ignoring invitations to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic for years because of its deep involvement with the Nazi regime during World War II, Bernstein finally acceded in 1966 and became a favorite of the ensemble in later decades. It was surely too much to hope that Mr. Dudamel, the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, would lead the players, twirling their instruments, in a raucous account of “Mambo” from “West Side Story,” as he has often done as an encore with the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela. But sure enough in the concert on Friday, which opened an Americas Tour with the Philharmonic, there was a Bernstein trifle to start off a rich slate of encores: the Waltz from his Divertimento for Orchestra. (The other encores were by Josef Strauss on Friday and Saturday, and Tchaikovsky on Sunday.) There was another possible nod to Bernstein in the program itself on Sunday afternoon: Charles Ives’s Second Symphony, a somewhat baffling cornucopia of Americana, and a bit of an adventure for the Viennese. Bernstein gave the premiere of the work with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie in 1951, nearly half a century after it was written. It is entirely possible, given the Vienna Philharmonic’s incremental (not to say glacial) and often indirect way of deviating from its norms, that this was intended as a significant tribute to Bernstein. In any case, the orchestra rewarded Mr. Dudamel and a packed house with a bang-up performance of the work. The players seemed to enjoy traipsing through the cluttered attic of Ives’s musical mind and memory as much as Mr. Dudamel did. The concluding unresolved dissonant splat of a chord seemed as sensible a way to end the piece as any. Oddly, the most problematic concert was the first, on Friday evening, with nothing but Brahms, mother’s milk for the Vienna Philharmonic. A little deference from a youngish conductor to this orchestra in such repertory can only be a good thing, but Mr. Dudamel seemed altogether too deferential in an inviting first half, offering the “Academic Festival Overture” and the “Haydn” Variations. He conducted squarely and without much vigor, missing some of the humor in the overture and the warmth in the variations. He fared better in the second half, with Brahms’s First Symphony, as the players nudged his sluggish tempos ahead, and by the finale, he appeared fully involved and taking control. (There seemed an echo here of another Brahms concert at Carnegie, on Thursday night, in which the superb violinist Leonidas Kavakos, joined with long-established partners, Emanuel Ax and Yo-Yo Ma, in the three piano trios. It turned out to be a wonderful evening, once past some initial reticence from Mr. Kavakos, which at times rendered his subtleties and refinements barely audible in so large a hall.) For the rest, Mr. Dudamel found an excellent stride. He opened the Saturday evening concert with the Adagio from Mahler’s unfinished 10th Symphony in a big, burly performance, and followed with a specialty of his, if not necessarily the orchestra’s: Berlioz’s “Symphonie Fantastique,” in a revelatory account. The Vienna Philharmonic, which consists of members of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, turned the piece into high drama. No one plays dances more infectiously than this band, and the rhythmic pull proved as gratifying in the waltz of the “Ball” scene as it was terrifying in the mad dance of the concluding “Dream of a Witches’ Sabbath.” The high strings produced fierce tremolos in the “Meadows” movement, and the percussionists and double basses sketched a harrowing, thundering “March to the Scaffold.” On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Dudamel followed the Ives with Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony, which the orchestra played to the hilt. Here, especially, many of the ensemble’s fine soloists had opportunities to shine, including, of all things, a bassoonist, Sophie Dartigalongue. And the stalwart concertmaster Rainer Honeck — seconded on the first stand of violins by another concertmaster, Albena Danailova — carried through the expert, energetic leadership he had shown throughout the weekend.",4694

That included 40,000 copies sold as a full album and nearly 120 million streams. In total it lost only 15 percent of its opening-week sales — a sign of staying power when big albums can drop 80 percent or more in Week 2. So far 2018 has been a big year for soundtracks, with two albums connected to films going to No. 1; the year began with two weeks at the top for “The Greatest Showman,” the P.T. Barnum biopic. According to Billboard, it is the first time in four years that two soundtracks have each notched more than one week at No. 1. (This week, “The Greatest Showman” holds at No. 3.) Also this week, Migos’s “Culture II” is No. 2, and two new albums round out the Top 5: Nipsey Hussle’s “Victory Lap” is in fourth place, and Brandi Carlile’s “By the Way, I Forgive You” is fifth.",1174

What steps did Vermeer take to make this painting?” These are some of the fundamental questions we still have about Johannes Vermeer’s beloved 1665 painting of a young woman in a blue and yellow turban, glancing beguilingly over her shoulder, according to Abbie Vandivere, paintings conservator at the Mauritshuis Royal Picture Gallery here. The answers may lie below the surface of her luminous face, inside her layers of paint, and within the crushed minerals that make up her 350-year-old pigments. That is the motivation for an intensive, two-week, noninvasive study of the work that will begin on Monday at the Mauritshuis, called “The Girl in the Spotlight,” coordinated and overseen by Ms. Vandivere. Using a panoply of new exploratory technologies, some borrowed from medicine, with complicated names such as fiber optic reflectance spectroscopy, macro X-ray powder diffraction and optical coherence tomography, the museum hopes to harvest all kinds of data about the “Girl,” as everyone at the museum simply calls her, to explore her inner life. It is an exceedingly rare occasion that the Mauritshuis takes “Girl” off the wall, but it seemed justified for this enormous team effort, which takes place under the umbrella of the Netherlands Institute for Conservation, Art and Science and includes participants from the National Gallery of Art in Washington; the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam; Delft University of Technology; and the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands. “The expertise and the scientific equipment are coming from the whole world, converging on this one painting, this one masterpiece,” Ms. Vandivere said. “We’ll see how much information we can gain with the technology at our disposal in a very short period of time — two weeks, working 24 hours a day, day and night.” The “Girl” is the star attraction of the Mauritshuis, a collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings that draws about 400,000 visitors each year. Removing her from public view for any length of time potentially affects attendance, so museum officials tried to keep the examination period as short as possible, and to keep her in the public eye as much as possible. Instead of taking her up to the restoration studio, Emilie Gordenker, the Mauritshuis’s director, decided to put the whole research project on display in the museum’s Golden Room, a regal chamber with 18th century décor, where the “Girl” and the research team will be enclosed in glass partitions while video monitors allow visitors to observe what’s happening inside. A high-resolution, three-dimensional reproduction of the “Girl” created by Océ, a Netherlands-based Canon company, will sit on an easel outside the glass chamber. “Getting the ‘Girl’ out of her frame means that she’s not visible in the way that she normally is for visitors, and that was a big concern for us because people come from far and wide to see this picture,” Ms. Gordenker said. “Occasionally she’ll be lying on a bed with all kinds of cameras hanging around her, so you might not be able to see her as usual, or she might be half covered by a scanner. We wanted to make sure that for people who will come, they get taken along in the process.” It has been more than two decades since Vermeer’s so-called “Mona Lisa of the North” has been the subject of an examination, and since that time, there has been a great deal of advancement in the tools used to examine artworks. In 1994, researchers employed tools such as X-radiography, UV photography and infrared reflectography, and took tiny paint samples out of the painting. Today’s imaging tools are noninvasive, which means there’s nary a brush or Q-tip in sight, and there will be no removal of particles. The technologies that have been brought together for this examination will “cull a few terabytes of data,” said Joris Dik, one of the lead researchers, from Delft University of Technology. These can later be used to create high-resolution computer visualizations of the painting that were never possible before. “I can imagine at the end we’ll have something like Google Earth where you can click on all different layers and zoom in and out of the painting to see different elements within the layers of paint,” he said. The “Girl” has been on display in the Mauritshuis since 1881. The work wasn’t considered to be a particular highlight of the collection — which also includes Rembrandt’s “The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp” and “The Goldfinch” by Carel Fabritius — until a major exhibition in collaboration with the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1995, followed by the publication of Tracy Chevalier’s best-selling novel of the same name four years later and the subsequent 2003 film, starring Scarlett Johansson. Ms. Chevalier imagined the fictional subject for Vermeer’s painting as a housemaid who is invited into the inner sanctum of the master’s studio, and allowed to wear his wife’s pearl earring for the portrait, creating a certain frisson between the artist and his model. Ms. Gordenker said that in reality, the picture probably wasn’t painted as a portrait of any particular person. Trying to figure out the identity of the real-life “Girl” — if there even was one — isn’t a question for research. “One of the things that makes this painting so spectacularly appealing is that we don’t know,” Ms. Gordenker said. That’s one mystery that this year’s inquiry will not attempt to solve.",5481

GOOD GIRLS 10 p.m. on NBC. It’s three suburban moms against the world in this new comedy-drama by Jenna Bans (“Desperate Housewives,” “Grey’s Anatomy”). Four minutes into this pilot, Beth (Christina Hendricks), Ruby (Retta) and Annie (Mae Whitman) have robbed the grocery store where Annie works. The story then backtracks to explain what drove them into that messy situation — the men in their lives share most of the blame — and the women quickly find themselves up against a larger threat than they anticipated. “‘Good Girls’ certainly works as a caper,” James Poniewozik wrote in The New York Times. “The problem is that it’s also very much a drama, and the needs of the one mode often conflict with those of the other.” THE VOICE 8 p.m. on NBC. Adam Levine and Blake Shelton are back for more bickering in Season 14. Alicia Keys returns to the red swivel chairs after her Season 12 win, while Kelly Clarkson makes her debut as a coach. IZOMBIE 9 p.m. on CW. This comical take on the zombie genre, centered on an undead medical examiner who uses her supernatural powers for good, returns for Season 4. Liv (Rose McIver) has a peculiar vision while investigating the killing of a Seattle Seahawks fan, and Major (Robert Buckley) is tasked with mentoring young, homeless zombies. In his review for The Times, Neil Genzlinger described the series as “ridiculously likable” and wrote, “It’s generally pretty smart, witty and well acted, and not afraid to turn dark on occasion.” LIVING BIBLICALLY 9:30 p.m. on CBS. Jay R. Ferguson stars as Chip, a New York film critic who looks inward after his best friend dies. Life throws him another curveball when his wife (Lindsey Kraft) announces she’s pregnant, motivating him to live according to the Bible throughout the pregnancy. Loosely inspired by the 2007 book by A. J. Jacobs, this new comedy opens with Chip announcing his plan and forming a “God Squad” to help him follow the text to the letter. RAT FILM (2017) 10:30 p.m. on PBS (check local listings); also on iTunes and Amazon. This experimental documentary links Baltimore’s rat problem to racial segregation. The main subject of the film, an exterminator, sums up the city’s divisive housing policies: “That’s where you’re going to find a rat: in the places where the most uneducated people are, the ones who have the least.” In her review, Jeannette Catsoulis named the film a Critic’s Pick and wrote, “The aesthetic audacity alone is intriguing; combined with Maureen Jones’s icily robotic narration and Dan Deacon’s eerie electronic score, the effect is somewhere between confounding and mesmerizing.” FINAL SPACE 10:30 p.m. on TBS.  As his prison sentence aboard the Galaxy One ends, a reckless spaceman (voiced by Olan Rogers) befriends an adorable green alien who turns out to be a coveted planet-destroying machine. Think “Futurama” meets “Star Wars.”",2990

While the band’s music has consistently tangled with anxiety and inner conflict, the lyrics of “Bottom” come from the perspective of a man on a crashing plane as he readies himself for oblivion. The rousing chorus goes: As the plane plummets into the sea, the song’s narrator is not frightened; he’s lived a good life, and he understands that he’s submitting to an inevitable and natural cycle. “The Walking Dead” doesn’t often make use of modern selections for its soundtrack, so the creative choice to use “At the Bottom of Everything” sticks out. The song scores a montage in which poor Carl, tainted by a zombie’s infected bite before to this season’s midwinter break, gets his affairs in order before succumbing to the toxins coursing through his body. Carl assumes the preternatural calm of the song’s narrator as he goes about this sad work, embracing death with far more maturity and serenity than the many adults who have been in his unenviable position. Seeing that Michonne has left him a heartfelt letter, he is moved to write farewell messages to everyone in the colony he cares about, although the plot keeps most of the characters too busy to get a moment of closure with him. But Carl does get one last beat with Rick, a poignant goodbye in which a father must grapple with his own failings as a parent. Rick sees his son’s unbothered preparations as not inspiring but devastating, a sign that he has insufficiently shielded Carl from the cruelties of their new world. Carl is all grown up, but too fast for Rick’s liking, and he feels tremendous guilt over the carefree youth that the boy never got to enjoy. In the most affecting moment of the season to date, Rick sobs to Carl, “All those things you had to do — you were just a boy.” He addresses his son as if Carl were a child soldier, which he might as well be, having been left with no choice but to gun down his innocence in order to stay alive. These are the meaningful emotional stakes for which this series has fruitlessly searched for so many weeks. Only when survivors invest themselves in another person can they — or we — truly be wounded. Just when it seemed as if the writers had fully numbed their audience to the impact of killing off a character, they remembered how to do so with the appropriate gravity. Positioning Carl’s process as the episode’s narrative centerpiece conveys respect for a child the audience has now spent eight years following, and who has often been the only point of relatability for younger viewers. Carl’s letters also give the episode a natural means of checking in elsewhere — the focus cuts to Michonne as she argues with Dwight, and to Ezekiel in captivity — while remaining tethered to the central pillar of this week’s drama. Will Rick and the others be given the appropriate narrative space to grieve? The writers tend to compartmentalize death, either breezing right past it once a scene is all done, or keeping the grief contained to a single episode before forging ahead. A return by Rick to business as usual next week would be a disservice to his son’s memory, undermining the gravitas of Carl’s death and the wrenching burial scene. “The Walking Dead” runs on a sharklike constant forward motion, as if any pause for reflection might bring it to a screeching halt. This week’s episode proves that pathos and excitement can peacefully coexist; with luck, future installments will see that principle through. In a heartening sign of things to come, the writers moved away from the usual cliffhanger ending and concluded this week’s episode with a slightly different brand of suspense. The episode intermittently crosscuts with the soft-focus vision of a distant tomorrow inhabited by Old Man Rick, as the fandom has termed him. Preordaining a peaceful future, especially an apparently zombie-free one, should be anathema to a show that clings to week-by-week anticipation. But the writers cleared a little room for mystery by revealing that this safe haven somehow includes a reformed Negan, who makes his only appearance to tousle a child’s hair while working out in the garden. It’s an uncharacteristically soft gesture for a character defined entirely by hardness, and it shifts the viewer’s interest from learning how Rick will win to learning how all of the characters might establish peace. For now, however, peace still seems rather distant. The episode concludes as young Henry, a subject of the peaceable Ezekiel, pikes the perfidious Gavin through the neck in order to save his King. His display of savagery stands in clear contrast to the monk-like oneness that Carl attains in the hours before he nobly takes his own life rather than let himself become a zombie. The next generation of children, raised with violence as their only status quo, may not share Carl’s gentle strength. Flash-forwards have confirmed that kinder days lie ahead. But if children really are the future, Henry’s actions suggest that a smooth transition into that peaceable time is anything but certain. A Few Thoughts While We Survey the Wreckage: • The special citation for the most gratuitous display of gore this week goes to Morgan, whose efforts at amateur espionage land him in a fight he resolves by jamming his finger directly into his attacker’s open flesh wound. Even with second-rate effects, the moment still triggers a twinge of sympathy pain. • “The Walking Dead” remains committed to a certain handful of characters, but they don’t always have much to do. For approximately three minutes, this episode checks in on Carol as she rallies support for the colony, a scene that serves only to pad out the running time on this already overlong episode.",5826

That was the moment of modern-day poetry that concluded last week’s installment of “Here and Now.” This week’s episode opens during the same drive. Greg spots a deer, impulsively pulls over, follows it into the woods, gets stung by a bee, wanders until he’s lost, falls down into the mud, dozes off under a tree and awakens the next morning to the sight of the same majestic deer defecating. He soon realizes that he’s been embarrassingly close to his car all night and speeds off to his ethics conference, where he turns his portentous but apparently meaningless experience into a vehicle for his new-found nihilism. For those of us who are already sick of Greg’s self-pitying pontification, and are disappointed to see him start to edge out Ramon as the show’s most prominent character, it’s a rough story to endure. If “Here and Now” never becomes anything more than an interesting failure, the Bayer-Boatwright patriarch’s rich-white-guy midlife crisis will surely deserve a healthy share of the blame. And yet, later in the episode, it’s one of Greg’s many monologues that provides a rare glimpse of the much better series one hopes it could still become. Humiliated by a TV news interview in which she seems to defend whichever student hung a black effigy from a tree at Kristen’s school, and reeling from the revelation that the principal is cutting the Empathy Initiative, Audrey has called Greg home for some sexual healing. But because he has run out of his “magic pills,” they end up talking in bed. She confronts him about his depression. He maintains that what looks like mental illness is really grief over growing older and watching the world become a place he no longer recognizes. “I really felt like I was part of it, and it was part of me,” he tells her. Until this scene, Greg came across as a sort of living Op-Ed page, rehashing the liberal hopelessness and outrage that has filled those columns for the past two years. His observation about aging — particularly the idea that it makes us lose our sense of unity with the world around us — is different. It explains not only his personal disillusionment, but, by implication, his alienation from idealistic young people like Ramon and also from the majority of American men of Greg’s age and race, whose beliefs have become incomprehensible to him. His loneliness is revealed to be more existential than physical. It helps that Tim Robbins and Holly Hunter, in the show’s first exchange worthy of their talents, play the scene with such tenderness. Whether it’s chemical, environmental or both, Greg’s affliction appears to be a potent cocktail of depression about the state of the world and anxiety about its future. He says as much at the ethics conference, scoffing at a colleague’s insistence that the most logical response to global turmoil is optimism. “No wonder Dante populated the first circle of hell with philosophers,” he says. “Anxiety is a completely appropriate response to today’s reality.” The word “anxiety” reverberates through this episode, the same way empathy and fear kept popping up last week. Ramon confesses to Farid that he hasn’t stopped smoking weed because it soothes his nerves. He and Henry don’t have much else to do in this hour, besides serving as foils for Ramon’s high-achieving older siblings — who are, by all appearances, driven primarily by their various anxieties. At the Bayer-Boatwright dinner party, Duc, who is quickly becoming a caricature of a Type A jerk, attacks Henry for working as a barista. Henry politely suggests that following some ambitious life plan doesn’t always work out the way you intend. A new character, Carmen (played by Fernanda Andrade), an “intuitive” who seems destined to play a role in both Duc’s and Ramon’s lives (she balks at Duc’s use of the word “psychic”), heartily agrees. It turns out that Ramon’s game, which he says is about “how we perceive impossibility,” whatever that means, isn’t exactly goal oriented, either. By now, it’s obvious that the “Here and Now” creator, Alan Ball, reserves much of his empathy (that word again!) for characters like Ramon, Henry and Ashley’s husband, Malcolm (Joe Williamson), who aren’t always laboring toward some inane accomplishment. In a purely expositional side story, Duc scolds Malcolm for squandering his opportunity to win a bike race, and Malcolm replies that he’d rather be happy than victorious. I appreciate that obnoxiously competitive people exist in the world, but three episodes in, I wish the show would give us a reason to care about Duc. Instead, it is painting Farid as a sort of secular saint. In a scene in which he bares his scarred back, the psychiatrist repeats worries he’s already expressed about Navid’s religious commitment and fluid gender expression: “I just want to keep you safe, that’s all,” he tells his son. “We already have targets on our backs.” As Farid explains to a clerk at Cannabliss, he suffers from “religious anxiety” and can only bear to attend a Muslim wedding after sharing a joint with (why not?) a homeless woman. The tension between Farid and his American-born family is rich with potential. But it is surrounded by so much narrative clutter that the show barely has time to dig into it. Meanwhile, Ashley is stuck with this week’s “huh?” subplot. Just as Kristen is informing Ashley’s model buddy that he gave her chlamydia (and that she still wouldn’t mind hooking up with him again), his girlfriend appears. When Ashley hears what happened, she lures him into her studio for a photo shoot, where she dresses him in a doughnut-print onesie, threatens to report him to the police and forces him to confess on camera that he is “guilty of statutory rape.” Later, she emails Kristen the video. Subject line: “VENGEANCE.” I guess this is supposed to be a righteous, girl-power moment, but it just made me pity the model. Yes, he cheated on his girlfriend (assuming they’re monogamous) and unknowingly passed chlamydia to a minor. Yes, the age of consent in Oregon is 18. But Kristen is 17, in a country where most states allow teens to consent at 16 or 17, and she was wearing a horse mask when they met and never took it off, before or during sex. Is humiliating this happy-go-lucky idiot and calling him a rapist — in that way implying that Kristen is a rape victim — really a sane response? I got the feeling that these scenes were supposed to demonstrate her loyalty to her sister, but Ashley comes out of them looking slightly unhinged. It’s story lines like these that crowd out the show’s more promising aspects, from Farid’s family drama to Ramon’s video game to Greg’s hunger to feel connected with the world again. Last week, I complained that “Here and Now” was spelling out what each character represents to the exclusion of exploring who they all are. That continuing issue aside, Ball is introducing too many subplots and invoking too many huge concepts (empathy, fear, anxiety, religious devotion, optimism, nihilism, relativism, hedonism, sexism, racism) to give any element the attention it deserves. At this point, an episode that delves deep into just a few characters or lingers at one event would be a relief. The only way to fix this show is to slow it down.",7369

Theresa, a formidable middle-aged professor (played by Jayne Houdyshell, in daunting mode), is at an academic conference, holding forth with steamroller confidence on the oppression of marginal peoples. She is so fixed in her megalithic presence, and so clearly used to being center stage, that she doesn’t let Msemaji (Pascale Armand), the young African-American writer with whom she’s supposedly having a dialogue, get more than a quickly gulped word in. Now what was that Theresa was saying again about including “people who have been historically left out of the conversation?” Yes, the irony is obvious, with its roaring subtext of “Socialist, socialize thyself.” But it’s a lively demonstration of self-deluding character in action, in which words and behavior contradict each other. What’s happening between these two women is both clear and charged with tension. As such, it’s an eminently actable moment for pros like Ms. Houdyshell (a Tony winner for “The Humans’) and the vivid Ms. Armand (“Eclipsed” on Broadway). It is also, unfortunately, one of the last times this production holds and tickles your attention. What follows is a discursive portrait of the divisions that exist between people seemingly on the same side in a great cause, especially in the shark-infested sea that is contemporary academia. From the get-go, you presume that Theresa is so smug in her perch that she’s destined to pull a Humpty Dumpty. And given that this fall is going to be enacted by Ms. Houdyshell, a performer with a gift for finding original edges in familiar shapes, you can assume that you’re going to be emotionally shaken, if not stirred, by the end of this MCC Theater production, directed at a faltering pace by Liesl Tommy. But as Ms. Houdyshell’s Theresa starts to lose her confidence, so does the play itself. The show is set in the meeting rooms, bars and bedrooms of a hotel where the fictional American Conference for Letters and Culture is convening to deliver papers and bestow awards and grants. (Clint Ramos did the appropriately sterile sets.) The friction between Theresa, a self-made scholar out of rural North Dakota, and the much younger Msemaji, who claims to have grown up amid privation and abuse, will wreak havoc with the plans of the conference’s most visible organizer, the callow but ambitious Kelly (a gee-whiz Molly Camp). In like manner, Mr. Lee’s play descends into what feels like a clash of hastily assembled talking points that never jell into persuasive form. Mr. Lee — whose credits as a television writer include “Looking,” “Girls” and “How to Get Away With Murder” — made an auspicious debut as a playwright several years ago with “Luce” at Lincoln Center Theater. Like that earlier work, about a white couple who adopt a son from a war-torn Congo, “Relevance” shows an admirable willingness to wrestle with uncomfortable subjects. It also shares an honorable refusal to provide conclusive answers to the complicated questions it poses, or to tilt its sympathies heavily toward any one of its four prickly characters. (Richard Masur, sporting a man bun, is David, Theresa’s agent and former lover.) Unfortunately, it’s difficult to feel much interest in, let alone liking for, any of them. “Relevance” might be seen as a latter-day variation on Ibsen’s “The Master Builder,” in which an aging architect becomes dangerously defensive (and destructive) when he hears the younger generation of his profession “knocking at my door.” Surely the same noise is echoing in Theresa’s head as she watches Msemaji hijack the conference and the attention. So the determined older professor, who didn’t rise to the top by being gentle and giving, decides to wage war against Msemaji, and to do so on the younger woman’s unfamiliar turf. That would be the landscape of social media, where reputations can be made and dashed in the twinkling of a tweet. Projected Twitter feeds and YouTube videos figure prominently in the play’s climactic face-off. (Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew is the projection designer.) And Msemaji is unmasked as something of a charlatan, though she’s so wily in the ways of web culture that she just might be able turn even this to her advantage. Or something like that. “Relevance” is filled with ideas, many of them promising. But they feel unanchored by anything other than prefab confrontations and mothy lines from a playwriting kit. The cast members still seem to be searching for their characters (and occasionally, their lines). Exacting professionals like Theresa are surely accustomed to more thoroughly thought-through work than what is presented here. “Relevance” feels like an intriguing rough draft prematurely thrown into public view.",4899

Having had a week to absorb its record-setting arrival, Hollywood is now sizing up the staying power of Marvel’s latest superhero movie. In its second weekend, “Black Panther” demonstrated an astounding hold on audiences in the United States and Canada, collecting about $108 million and pushing its global total after only 12 days of release to roughly $704 million, according to comScore. As a point of context, Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” collected $773 million in 2014 over its entire five-month run. Imax, which is playing “Black Panther” in more than 60 countries, said people are paying to see the film more than once, a quality that the biggest of the big movies share. “This movie has very strong word of mouth and a deeply loyal core fan base, which are both necessary criteria for repeat business,” said Greg Foster, Imax’s entertainment chief. And the euphorically reviewed film has yet to arrive in China and Japan, two of Hollywood’s biggest markets. Strong results in other Asian countries, including South Korea, bode well. For the weekend in North America, three new movies arrived in wide release, and each struggled to get noticed as “Black Panther” dominated. “Game Night” (Warner Bros.) did the best, taking second place with an estimated $16.6 million. New Line, a division of Warner, spent about $35 million to make the R-rated comedy, which received very strong reviews and stars Rachel McAdams and Jason Bateman. The holdover “Peter Rabbit” (Sony) chugged away in third place, selling about $12.5 million in tickets, for a three-week total of $71.3 million. That left the expensive “Annihilation” in fourth place, with $11 million in estimated ticket sales. An R-rated science-fiction drama directed by Alex Garland (“Ex Machina”) and starring Natalie Portman as a biologist, “Annihilation” cost Paramount Pictures and David Ellison’s Skydance at least $40 million to make. Most critics loved “Annihilation,” but multiplex ticket buyers gave it a C grade in CinemaScore exit polls. Had it cost less to produce, Mr. Garland’s movie possibly could have succeeded as an art-house film. But Paramount, which has struggled badly of late, wants to compete in the wide-release business. “Annihilation” was a holdover from a previous management team at the studio, where a large number of senior executives have quit or been fired over the last year as the studio attempts a turnaround. New managers sold off overseas rights for “Annihilation” to Netflix. The weekend’s remaining new wide-release film was “Every Day,” a microbudgeted teenage fantasy-romance that took in about $3.1 million and was marketed mostly online. The movie was the first from a rebooted Orion Pictures, which is owned by Metro Goldwyn Mayer.",2850

Penelope (Justina Machado) struggles to cope with her mental health and re-enter the dating world; her daughter, Elena (Isabella Gomez), has trouble finding her romantic footing as well. Alex (Marcel Ruiz) maintains his post as his abuela’s favorite grandchild, but even he’s not safe from anti-Latino discrimination.

Led by the series’s two showrunners, Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce, the writing team has created a compelling family sitcom that’s in equal measures thoughtful, serious and funny. In a recent phone conversation, Ms. Kellett, who is herself Cuban-American, talked about the stunning Season 2 finale, as well as some of the political challenges facing Latinos today and what’s ahead for the Alvarez family in Season 3. Following are edited excerpts from the spoiler-filled interview. After all the attention “One Day at a Time” got for its first season, what was it like to come back for Season 2? Oh, it was so nice. I love my cast, and I love my writers. We have such a great room. We just missed each other, so we just sat down and talked about where we were at in our lives. How that manifested into stories. Mike [Mike Royce] and I like to meet in between and get a sense of what we would like our season arc to be. We then get to talk to them [the writers] about “Here’s what we’re thinking,” and we’ll give them a rough skeleton of where we want to go. It was really nice to sit down and brainstorm about what’s going on in this world and how that would affect this family. So you sketch out what’s next for Season 2, then what happens? Going into Season 2, we knew we wanted to end with Lydia having the stroke and that the final episode would be an homage to the “Maud” episode that he and I both love. It’s where everyone gets to do a monologue. So along the way, we knew we wanted to build in some of the stroke stuff. We knew we wanted to have Penelope in a relationship and for it to amicably — over something like having children — end. That just felt like something a lot of women I know who are nearing 40 are experiencing. Same with Elena. We knew we wanted her to have a girlfriend and to start this positive relationship with her. We knew we wanted to make a baby step with Victor [Penelope’s ex-husband and the children’s father, played by James Martinez]. It’s not a complete resolution, but something that seemed hopeful. We came in with those things, sat with the writers, and they tell us what’s going on in their lives and what’s been important. We find a middle ground and break the stories, and that’s that. The country’s politics have changed since the premiere of Season 1. How did you decide to incorporate that into the show — like the episode when Alex gets called an ethnic slur? That was based on a real incident. That happened to my brother at a beach in San Diego. We’ve lived in San Diego for 20 years. He called me up post-Trump, “I was just at the beach, and someone told me to go back to Mexico!” He was laughing about it because he doesn’t care. But it’s like, “What’s happening?” We try on the show to show many points of view. Obviously, the show has a liberal bent, but we try to show all sides of an issue so all sides of the conversation can start. This is something we thought would affect this family, so how would they talk about it? What would that look like? Do you worry whether any of the characters might become unrelatable as you’re preparing for the next season? I don’t think so. It all starts from a real place. The Lydia stuff that’s the most outrageous is stuff that’s actually happened in my real life. My mom had a stroke and didn’t tell me for 12 years! That’s real! I was just talking with her and she said, “Aye, when I had a stroke … ” “Wait, what stroke?” “Ah, your wedding was happening, I didn’t want to bother you.” “Oye, mom, you better tell somebody!” All that is real. It seems dramatic, but in a wonderful way in the arms of Rita Moreno, it has that diva turn. A colleague of mine has written about how the show has this wonderful sense of joy. It feels like a celebration of Cuban culture, Latino identity, the immigrant experience and family. Is that a conscious choice when writing? Well, that’s just my experience. Really, my house is not a sad place ever. We feel so blessed, we feel so grateful. We have a really good time. In the media, Latino families are always in crisis — there’s gang violence, people weeping. That’s just not what I know it to be. I wanted to reflect my experience, too, and to throw that in the ring. It seems a lot of people relate to that, too. Last season, you addressed immigration with Elena’s friend Carmen and her parents’ deportation. This time, you have Lydia and Schneider (Todd Grinnell) going through the citizenship process. Was that something you wanted to keep exploring? In my family, not all of the Cubans became citizens. My parents became citizens, but I have aunts and uncles who did not. When you become a U.S. citizen, you have to renounce your Cuban citizenship. They’re green card holders — they pay taxes, social security and they can’t vote. When Trump started deporting people, my cousins got really concerned. “Should we have mom become a citizen?” There was all this worry. What if Lydia had never become a citizen? Then it would be fun to have her and Schneider go on that journey together. Another story line you kept exploring this season was Penelope’s depression, and how she’s still struggling with the social stigma and the need to rely on antidepressants to help her. We really wanted to get that right. It also seemed like something veterans really struggle with; Latinos have a lot of issues with discussing it or going on medications. We wanted to explore what that was like for this character. Also, she’s at a great point in her life, so it’s that placebo of “Everything is going great, and I don’t need to do any of this stuff anymore.” Then, we saw what the reality of that looked like for her. She couldn’t talk to her mom about it, and she couldn’t talk to her boyfriend about it because she was embarrassed. It was also a way to deepen her relationship with Schneider because he was the only person she could talk to about it. Is there a story you’re looking forward to continuing in Season 3? Well, we have a few things built in already. Penelope is in school, so she still will be in school, or maybe graduate. We get to see her journey to being a nurse practitioner. Seeing what else is out there for her dating life as well. Deepening Elena’s relationship. Maybe Alex will get to have a little love in his life. And of course, we’ll be taking into consideration what's happening in the next month or two months from now. The news is crazy.",7357
5a92dd9e410cf7000162ddd9,2018-02-25T16:00:24+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/arts/television/good-girls-review-nbc-christina-hendricks.html,Culture,"There are reasons, which quickly become apparent, that “Good Girls” is not called “Breaking Bad Girls.” But the surface parallels to “Breaking Bad,” the teacher-turned-drug-dealer drama, are tough to miss. The story starts with money trouble that can’t be solved within the bounds of lawful behavior. Beth (Christina Hendricks) wants to shed a philandering husband (Matthew Lillard) without losing her house. Her sister, Annie (Mae Whitman), is in a custody battle with her more-affluent ex (Zach Gilford). Ruby (Retta) has a daughter in need of an expensive medical treatment that must be paid for out of pocket. Like Walter White opening up his artisanal meth business to pay his medical bills, they hit on an idea: a daylight armed robbery of the suburban Michigan grocery where Annie works. Within a couple of commercial breaks, the three are in and out and counting their take. But the plan has worked too well. Instead of the $30,000 they were expecting, the store vault has half a million bucks. Annie’s sleazeball boss has been laundering money for a gang, leaving the trio to hide a fortune and get a quick education in organized crime. The resulting frying-pan-and-fire story line forces the three leads to confront how serious they are about being criminals. The problem, as enjoyable as “Good Girls” often is, is that it seems unsure how serious it is about being a crime story. “Good Girls,” which begins Monday on NBC, has an empowerment theme that’s timely in the #MeToo era. But it also speaks to antihero dramas’ long history of giving men — generally only men — license to be bad. For Walter White and his many TV cousins, crime has often been about self-worth, even virility. (Tony Soprano’s big boat is named “The Stugots,” after an Italian male-anatomical slang term.) For Beth, Annie and Ruby, the money is more about self-determination: freedom from reliance on lousy men or the whims of the economy. When Ruby, flush with cash, sees an expensive doctor who offers her cucumber water, she cries a little bit at the upgrade in attention that money can buy. The series, created by Jenna Bans, is tartly funny, less heavy than its cable kin and more concerned with righteous payback than ethical angst. But it’s not entirely light, either. There’s some blood — more than a tablespoon, less than a gallon — and an attempted rape early on. This material feels like it should carry more weight than “Good Girls” often gives it. “Good Girls” certainly works as a caper, especially given the rapport among its three leads. You can’t not want to spend an hour watching Ms. Hendricks, Ms. Whitman and Retta rob stuff. The show gets plenty of mileage from its surburbanites-gone-wild conceit, as when Ruby chooses the location for a rendezvous: “They always do the drop-off at a park on ‘Law & Order.’” The problem is that it’s also very much a drama, and the needs of the one mode often conflict with those of the other. (Throw in the scenes between Ms. Whitman and Mr. Gilford, formerly of “Friday Night Lights,” and the show occasionally shades into a third genre, a more-realistic family dramedy along the lines of Ms. Whitman’s former show, “Parenthood.”) To work as a walk-on-the-wild-side drama, the series needs a sense of stakes, that bad things can happen and that characters can come to bad ends. To deliver on the ironies of that “Good” in the title, there needs to be moral conflict — the possibility that these protagonists, however much we like them, might make a wrong choice that will get somebody hurt. But because “Good Girls” has an offbeat tone — and airs on a broadcast network — you get the feeling that the guardrails are up. Most of the threatening situations resolve comically, and we’re reminded that the robbery is a victimless crime. “We’re normal people,” Beth says. “We pay our taxes, and we take our kids to P.F. Chang’s, and we take orange slices to soccer games.” That’s a valid choice, but one more consistent with an escapist comedy, and at times the show seems to have other intentions. I’ve only seen three episodes of “Good Girls,” however, and it’s possible that the uneven tone reflects the characters’ situations. Just as the women have to decide if they’re actual criminals or just dabblers, so, too, may “Good Girls” land on a better sense of what kind of series it is. There’s a sign of its long-term direction in the third episode, when Beth considers whether she’s breaking the law simply for the money or because she likes it. This might also address the question of how you make an extended series about three characters trying to get out of the crime business, rather than into it. But maybe the pleasures of “Good Girls” so far are like the proceeds from a heist. You’ve just got to enjoy them while they last.",4773
5a92dd89410cf7000162ddd8,2018-02-25T16:00:03+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/books/there-are-no-dead-here-colombia-maria-mcfarland-sanchez-moreno.html,Culture,"When the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was killed in 1993, Colombia’s bloody troubles did not die with him. In “There Are No Dead Here,” Maria McFarland Sánchez-Moreno, who spent years as a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch, writes about the harrowing violence carried out by paramilitary groups that bloomed in the country in the late 1990s. She focuses on the stories of three men who have tried to help solve the problem against enormous odds: the human rights activist Jesús María Valle, who was murdered for what he exposed; the prosecutor Iván Velásquez; and the journalist Ricardo Calderón. The book covers their dangerous efforts, the links between the paramilitaries and Colombia’s political establishment, and the influence of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and its war on drugs. Ms. McFarland, now the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, discusses below the bravery of her subjects, the inspiration she takes from photojournalists who work in conflict areas and more. When did you first get the idea to write this book? It started when I had finished up being a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch. I had spent six years documenting atrocities and trying to get the government to address them. But I was frustrated, because all those documents I had been producing didn’t really capture the reality I had gotten to know so well, the stories of these extraordinary people, who despite horrendous conditions often insisted on fighting for truth, for justice; insisted on being incredibly honest even though they could have easily gone in another direction and all the pressures were in that direction. In the United States, anyone who knew anything about Colombia knew about Pablo Escobar and the FARC, but very few people knew about the paramilitaries, and stories usually depicted the heroes as D.E.A. agents or law enforcement. They were missing this whole piece, these ordinary people who make tremendous sacrifices, take huge risks and often get killed because they’re standing on principle. I started out with the idea of just doing an article in 2012. I was very focused on the story of Iván Velásquez, who had followed the links between congress and these paramilitary death squads. He had worked very much alone with not much support, and faced an elaborate campaign by high-level government officials and those in the intelligence service to discredit him. As I talked to him, I realized it was part of a much larger story. He was personally connected to the other two characters in the book. I started drafting a book proposal, which took four years to write. The book took two. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? I knew that people were brave. But once I started asking them for their stories in details, I was surprised by just how many risks they took. And when I spoke to their family members, they received threats and had themselves been wrapped up in this and terribly impacted. Yet they had never tried to get them to stop doing their work. In fact, María Victoria, Iván’s wife, kept some very serious threats made against her secret because she didn’t want him to give up what he was doing. She knew it would break him because it was such an important part of who he was, to follow through on his commitment. With Calderón, I didn’t realize the sort of risks he had taken. I knew him as a journalist, and I knew he had exposed these scandals and efforts to smear Velásquez. I didn’t realize just how intrepid he was because he was just so humble. Years later, I found out he had actually been abducted by his sources in the intelligence service at one point. They thought he was going to betray them and they needed to know if he was being straight with them. They gave him this drug to tell the truth and he lost consciousness overnight. He just kept going with his work; met with them the next day and they apologized. In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? I started out with a very important story about one man who led these investigations and was attacked and then prevailed. It turned into a much richer story when I brought in these other characters and dug into the history. Once I had a broader scope and more characters, I could trace the arc of how the paramilitaries grew and what they were, and how they were able to gain so much power and influence and develop all these connections, in a way I wouldn’t have been able to do if the book had been about one set of investigations. Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work? Photojournalists, in general, who have worked in some of these conflicts. One of them is Stephen Ferry, with whom I worked very closely in Colombia. He captured the humanity and all sorts of nuances of the reality of Colombia in ways that aren’t usually presented in journalism and in the policy world. Seeing someone who’s able to capture those deeper aspects of reality made me also want to do that. Another piece that made an impression on me while I was writing the book was Joshua Oppenheimer’s movie “The Look of Silence,” a sequel to “The Act of Killing.” He’s able to show what it means for people to live with a legacy of mass atrocity while the perpetrators are still in power, and in a way that’s what was happening in Colombia while I was there. Persuade someone to read “There Are No Dead Here” in 50 words or less. It’s a fast-paced true story, something of a thriller. It introduces you to brutality and corruption in a country at the center of the United States’ war on drugs. It also offers hope that brave, committed people who care about what’s right can make a difference. This interview has been condensed and edited.",5752

Mr. Rockwell, 49, has a gift for playing droll, loopy characters most at home on society’s margins, in films like “The Green Mile,” “Moon” and “The Way Way Back.” Now he’s been thrust to the fore with his award-winning performance as a racist police officer, Jason Dixon, in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” The movie has drawn criticism for its use of racial slurs and depictions of consequence-free violence, but Mr. Rockwell, who is favored to win the Oscar for best supporting actor at next Sunday’s ceremony, said that complex stories are bound to “stir up a lot of feelings.” He chatted with me by phone last week, shortly after winning a Bafta (the British equivalent of the Oscars), about life as a character actor, his proud and protective father, and how being a middle schooler in San Francisco helped make him such a swell dancer, albeit one with less rhythm than Usher. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. In your opening monologue for “Saturday Night Live,” you made light of your work as  a longstanding character actor. Does it bother you, that designation?  We were making fun of my persona. I’m not a household name like Brad Pitt. People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you’re barely recognizing them. I think Billy Crudup, Chris Walken, Robert De Niro, they’re all great examples of that.  People often use the word “quirky” to describe your characters. Do they all have to be iterations of you? I think in every character you’re finding a version of yourself. I don’t relate to racism, because I wasn’t brought up that way. I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I’m drawn to complex characters; they’re all filled with so many different feelings, and that’s what makes them interesting. The first “Iron Man,” Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he’s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That’s what’s interesting. What do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?  It’s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He’s a doofus, he’s a racist, he’s violent, he’s a mama’s boy. There’s a few heroic things at certain points. But he’s very flawed, and it’s a boy-to-man journey. There’s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.  It’s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It’s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways — it’s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren’t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don’t necessarily get punished. Did it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines? No, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it’s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it — the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That’s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that’s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film’s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It’s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It’s been an incredibly vibrant year. You’re a really good dancer — you can really bust a move. You did the splits on “Saturday Night Live.” How did that come about? Is it self-taught? It’s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls. What kind of certain crowd? San Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn’t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn’t win a lot of those fights. I didn’t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when “Thriller” and “Purple Rain” came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in “Risky Business.” I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I’m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood. Were you intimidated working with Frances McDormand? I think it’s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, “Were you intimidated by her?” Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I’ve worked with a lot of great actors. She’s really a force. I think what’s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people — Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film’s writer-director], Frances — are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I’m not exactly conventional either. So your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film — he defended you. Was it definitely your dad? Yes that was my father. I didn’t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father. He was just looking out for the kid.",6281

THE WALKING DEAD 9 p.m. on AMC. As the show returns from a brief vacation — major spoilers ahead — Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the show’s Big Bad, has firmly taken control in the “All Out War,” and a showdown with Rick (Andrew Lincoln) looms in the distance. The biggest cliffhanger before the midseason break, however, didn’t have to do with that confrontation, but rather with the plight of Rick’s son, Carl (Chandler Riggs), who was bitten by a Walker and faces almost certain death. Some viewers weren’t too happy about that: “Carl’s kinder tendencies have been a peg on which viewers could hang their hopes for a livable future, and the sting from having that possibility snatched away lingers,” Charles Bramesco wrote in his recap in The New York Times. 2018 PYEONGCHANG OLYMPICS 7 p.m. on NBC. It’s closing time for the Winter Olympics, which featured the ascendance of new faces, like Adam Rippon, and lingering triumphs from familiar ones, like Shaun White. On Sunday, NBC will televise the closing ceremony, which will include K-pop stars and other showcases of Korean culture. Simone Biles will carry the United States flag, and Ivanka Trump will be on hand to watch the ceremonies. FEAR FACTOR 7 p.m. on MTV. The terrifying and grotesque game show returns for its ninth season, with Ludacris serving as host. Tune in to see contestants mingle with crocodiles, get buried alive and submerged underwater, escape from haunted houses, and perhaps most terrifyingly, watch their iPhones go through a blender. VICTORIA 8 p.m. on PBS. Season 2 closes with romance, sickness and violence. A daughter of Victoria (Jenna Coleman) and Albert (Tom Hughes) falls dangerously ill. And Peel takes to Parliament in the hope of repealing the Corn Laws and faces strident opposition. A special episode, “Comfort and Joy,” follows at 9, and chases various romances around the palace at Christmas in 1846. ASH VS. EVIL DEAD 9 p.m. on Starz. Ash Williams excels at killing monsters. He’s less successful with maturity and responsibility. Forty years after the first “Evil Dead,” Bruce Campbell’s Ash is still wielding a sledgehammer and cracking wise in this extension of Sam Raimi’s horror-comedy universe. “It’s clever, engaging, brisk and, crucially, unpretentious,” Mike Hale wrote in his review in The Times in 2015. Season 3 begins on Sunday, with Ash reveling in his status as the hero du jour of Elk Grove and serving as the proprietor of a hardware store. Of course, dark forces soon return to the town and target his daughter, Brandy (Arielle Carver-O’Neill). LOGAN LUCKY (2017) on Amazon Prime. By this point, Steven Soderbergh has the heist movie down to a science, given his work on the “Oceans” trilogy. But his film “Logan Lucky” operates in a very different income bracket and locale: it centers on a couple of West Virginia guys working hard to steal cash from a Nascar race.

The announcement on Saturday came as a surprise: Ms. Pintilie’s formally experimental feature was one of the festival’s more divisive entries, partly because of the frankness of some of its sex scenes and was not considered a front-runner. It tells the story of three people — including a fiftysomething woman who recoils at being touched and a man crippled by spinal muscular atrophy — struggling with issues of intimacy. It also won the award for best first feature film. This was a particularly strong year for German films at the festival, with several homegrown entries, including Christian Petzold’s “Transit,” considered favorites for the major awards. Ultimately, however, they went home empty-handed. The Silver Bear, or the runner-up prize, went to “Mug,” by Małgorzata Szumowska of Poland. The film, a fable set in rural Poland, focuses on a young man who is seriously injured after an accident on the construction site of the world’s largest Jesus statue. In a nod to the discussions about gender equality that has dominated much of the festival, Ms. Szumowska noted in her acceptance speech, “I am so happy I am a female director.” The award for best actor went to the 23-year-old Frenchman Anthony Bajon, for his live wire performance in “The Prayer” as a recovering drug addict at a Catholic sanctuary in southern France. Ana Brun took home the best actress prize for her role as a middle-aged woman forced to reshape her life after her long-term girlfriend is imprisoned for fraud in “The Heiresses.” The understated film, set in Paraguay, also took home the Alfred Bauer Prize for a feature “that opens new perspectives.” Wes Anderson won the best director award for “Isle of Dogs,” the festival’s most star-studded competition entry, while the best screenplay award went to Manuel Alcalá and Alonso Ruizpalacios for “Museum,” a Mexican heist film starring Gael García Bernal. The Teddy Award for best gay-themed film was awarded to “Hard Paint,” a Brazilian film about a young man working as a chat-room performer.",2194

Inspired by news reports about families living in cheap motels after the Great Recession, this drama by Sean Baker follows a mother-daughter relationship over the course of a summer in Central Florida. Six-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) is as carefree as a child should be, capering about the Magic Castle motel with her partners in crime Scooty (Christopher Rivera) and Jancey (Valeria Cotto), while her rebellious mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite), can barely make ends meet. Willem Dafoe assumes the role of responsible guardian as the admirable motel manager, which earned him a nomination for best supporting actor. “This movie insists on meeting people on both sides of the screen where they are, on suspending judgment and extending compassion without abandoning its ethical grounding,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. LAST MEN IN ALEPPO (2017) on iTunes and Netflix. Hollywood celebrated the volunteers of Syria Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, last year by awarding Orlando von Einsiedel an Oscar for his 2015 short “The White Helmets.” The search-and-rescue team is back in the Academy spotlight with this documentary by the Syrian director Feras Fayyad. He spent nearly two years following the emergency rescue workers as they raced to the scenes of airstrikes in search of survivors. “It kills something inside you,” Mr. Fayyad told The Times. “We made a film about our nightmare.” THE SQUARE (2017) on iTunes and Amazon. The protagonist of this Oscar nominee for best foreign language film is a sleek curator (Claes Bang) at a modern Stockholm museum who’s preparing for a coming exhibition on morality and trust. He has faith in the artwork, titled “The Square,” yet his behavior outside the museum contradicts the ideals “The Square” champions. There’s more to the feature’s meandering plot, and it’s worth watching for the surprise factor, wry dialogue and provocative scenes. The film practices “an aesthetics of shaming, laying bare the hypocrisy, the selfishness and the wishful thinking embedded in the deep structures of 21st-century metropolitan existence,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. NOTES FROM THE FIELD (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; also on HBO streaming services. The playwright and actress Anna Deavere Smith portrayed 18 real-life characters in her 2016 one-woman show, “Notes From the Field.” Each of the subjects has played a role in the fight for underprivileged American youth who fall victim to institutional racism and mass incarceration. This film adaptation weaves Ms. Smith’s electrifying performance with sobering video footage and photographs. PYEONGCHANG 2018 OLYMPICS 7 p.m. on NBC.

Once the final curtain goes down, the show vanishes forever, save in the memories of the audience and the actors. Rick McKay made it his task to preserve some of those memories. He recorded hundreds of hours of interviews with dozens of actors about their recollections of New York theater, then turned them into the documentary “Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There” (2004). Mr. McKay had far more material than he could squeeze into one documentary, so he worked on two sequels. He had completed a rough cut of the second, but neither was released before he was found dead on Jan. 29 in his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 62. His brother, Stephen, said the cause had not been determined. Mr. McKay sang in cabarets and on cruise ships and produced segments for programs about the arts on the New York public television station WNET before he began interviewing Broadway performers, originally with the idea of possibly using the material for another public TV segment. He soon envisioned a grander project, one that became more feasible when he persuaded the actress Bea Arthur to let him interview her at her home in the mid-1990s. Mr. McKay told the podcast “Behind the Curtain: Broadway’s Living Legends” in 2016 that Ms. Arthur was dismayed when he told her that he planned to conduct the interview while handling the camera, sound and lighting by himself. But the interview went well, and she connected him to some of her famous friends. He used her connections and those of his own friends in show business as entree to an ever-wider circle of celebrities. Mr. McKay was persistent in his pursuit of different actors, and once he got them on camera he was a convivial, sympathetic interviewer. The secret to getting stars to open up about their lives was easy, he said on the podcast: Do extensive research and “make it about them, constantly about them.” Julie Harris, Stephen Sondheim, Ben Gazzara, Elaine Stritch, Carol Burnett, Diahann Carroll, Alec Baldwin and Shirley MacLaine were among the luminaries he interviewed. “Most people will never work with a cast like this,” Mr. McKay told The Los Angeles Times in 2004. In “Broadway,” which Mr. McKay produced, directed and edited, Ms. MacLaine reminisced about making lemonade for herself out of free lemons, water and sugar at a Manhattan automat. Mr. Gazzara recalled skipping school for more than a month to see every play on Broadway. And Ms. Burnett remembered sharing an audition dress with three other aspiring actresses. Mr. McKay also tracked down rare archival footage, including an audio recording of Marlon Brando in “A Streetcar Named Desire” during the play’s original Broadway run in the late 1940s. The documentary was shown at art-house cinemas and won more than a dozen awards at film festivals. Critics were mostly enthusiastic. “ ‘Broadway: The Golden Age’ is all chatter all the time, but that’s a good thing,” Desson Thomson wrote in The Washington Post. “The chatterers, you see, are actors of a certain vintage,” he continued. “A Broadway vintage, that is. And the stories they tell in this warm, evocative documentary crackle with humor and glow with reverence.” Mr. McKay’s brother said he was not sure when the two subsequent parts of the documentary would be released. Richard Charles McKay was born on Aug. 30, 1955, in a suburb of Boston. His mother, the former Alyce Monroe, was a homemaker and theater buff, and his father, James McKay, was an engineer. When Rick was still young the family moved to Beech Grove, Ind., near Indianapolis, where he was active in musical theater and graduated from high school. He taught at the Indiana School for the Deaf, moved to Boston in the early 1970s, then lived in Japan, where he was an English teacher and nightclub singer. After moving to New York, he kept singing in clubs and on cruises and later turned to broadcast and print journalism. At his death Mr. McKay was also working on a documentary about the actress Fay Wray, a friend of his for years. In addition to his brother, he is survived by four sisters, Stacie Stevenson and Sandy, Hope and Linda McKay.",4201

He was 64. The country’s president, Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, announced the death on Twitter. No cause was given. Mr. Ouedraogo (pronounced oh-dra-OH-go) was in his early 30s when he wrote and directed his first feature, “Yam Daabo” (“The Choice,” in the Mooré language of Burkina Faso, which is in Western Africa), a 1986 release about a family disrupted by famine. When it was shown in New York in 1988 as part of the Museum of Modern Art’s New Directors/New Films festival, Caryn James, in her review in The New York Times, called it “a beautifully composed, emotionally triumphant film” and said that “it brings to our attention a most valuable filmmaker.” A bigger international success came in May 1990, when Mr. Ouedraogo’s “Tilai” (“The Law”), about the violation of familial taboos, was one of two films to receive the Grand Prix at the Cannes festival, the event’s second-highest honor after the Golden Palm. “Films like ‘Tilai’ do more than restore one’s spirit,” Jay Carr wrote in reviewing it in The Boston Globe in 1991, “they restore one’s perspective, reminding us that there’s still such a thing as a self-renewing world cinema, and Ouedraogo — not likely to be invited to a Hollywood power lunch soon — is a major figure in it.” Mr. Ouedraogo was born on Jan. 21, 1954, in Banfora, Burkina Faso. His parents were farmers, and he grew up in a village outside Ouagadougou. In primary school, he showed enough promise that, as was customary, he was sent to Ouagadougou to continue his studies. There, he made sure to reserve enough money each week to buy a ticket for a weekend show at one of the city’s three outdoor cinemas, favoring karate films and Hindi musicals. Mr. Ouedraogo continued his education at the Institut d’Hautes Études Cinématographiques in Paris. (Burkina Faso is a former French protectorate, and its official language is French.) He received a degree in film studies at the Sorbonne in 1985. Mr. Ouedraogo made a series of short films before “The Choice,” and he followed that feature with “Yaaba” (“Grandmother”), which won a critic’s prize at Cannes in 1989. His later films included “Samba Traoré” (1993), about the aftermath of a botched robbery (the title is a character’s name), and “Kini & Adams” (1997), a story about two friends in Zimbabwe. “Samba Traoré” won a prize at the Berlin Film Festival, and “Kini & Adams” was shown at Cannes. In 2002, he contributed a segment to “September 11,” a composite film in which 11 directors provided different perspectives from around the world on the 9/11 attacks. His was a somewhat humorous take, a story about five impoverished boys who become convinced that Osama bin Laden is in their town and hope to earn a $25 million reward by capturing him. Mr. Ouedraogo largely used villagers and other nonprofessional actors in his films. Sometimes, to explain what he was doing, he would have to show them a movie first because they had never seen one. Scripts were often useless because his amateur actors couldn’t read. “I don’t teach them how to act,” he said in a 1989 interview with The Times. “The lines are easy and often ad-libbed. I simply explain to them what emotions I want them to feel under certain situations. And they already know a very wide range of these emotions.” Throughout his career, Mr. Ouedraogo advocated for better financing for African films — he would often travel to Paris to secure backing for his — and for setting a high bar. “I want African cinema to escape from the ghetto, to get more resources,” he told The Guardian in 1991, “but I don’t see myself as an ‘African’ director. I think films should be relevant to everybody.” Mr. Ouedraogo was sometimes criticized for presenting one particular aspect of Africa — small stories of village life — and not taking on subjects like rampant political corruption. But he was unapologetic. “Some people make politics their life,” he told The Guardian in 1991. “I don’t.” His most recent feature film, according to the Internet Movie Database, was “Kato Kato” in 2006. He also sometimes directed for African television and the theater and produced movies. A list of his survivors was not immediately available, but he had a large extended family, as is evident from the credits on his movies, which are full of Ouedraogos. Although Mr. Ouedraogo once explained that the name is common in his country and that not all people with it are related, many actors and crew members were from his family, which made for an interesting scene at Cannes in 1990. “ ‘Tilai’ takes place in remote African villages made of mud and straw, and is played by a fine cast of barefoot actors, a number of whom are the director’s relatives,” the critic Janet Maslin wrote in The Times. “Immediately after the screening of ‘Tilai,’ this same group and the director himself appeared at a black-tie festival reception in their dinner clothes and were warmly congratulated by, among others, the director of a film festival in Moscow. “Culture shock in Cannes isn’t just an occupational hazard. It’s a way of life.”",5342

Read the rest of our classical music coverage here. AT 2 MINUTES 54 SECONDS The Italian soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci’s recital at Zankel Hall this week was full of surprises: rarities by Respighi, Nadia Boulanger and Poulenc, as well as some angular patter music by Britten than seemed to prefigure Stephen Sondheim’s “Company,” decades before its premiere. For one of her encores, Ms. Antonacci sang the “Habanera” from “Carmen,” but this foray into the extremely familiar was as eye-opening as the rest of the program: Her voice rarely rose above a mezzo-piano, which lent a beguiling mystery to a performance that verged on cabaret. In this video from the Opéra Comique in Paris, Ms. Antonacci is louder, out of necessity, but is still seductively restrained in key moments, such as when she sings, with a tinge of horror: “If I love you, beware.” JOSHUA BARONE “Ms. Antonacci, 56, has pursued corners of the repertory that rarely get done here” “A Career That Moves in Mysterious Ways” at 46 seconds Anna Caterina Antonacci’s recital this week at Zankel Hall was a quietly shattering yet deeply satisfying evening, a study in aging, nostalgia and death pursued through ripe Respighi songs, autumnal Nadia Boulanger, changeable early Britten, wryly pained Poulenc. (And, as encores, exquisitely shaped Frescobaldi and that almost murmured “Habanera.”) No program notes, no speeches from the stage; she treated her audience like adults, sharing with them an intimacy charged with mystery. All was lucid yet subtle, the emotions true and never overplayed. One of my favorite Antonacci moments, of many, is similar: Her entrance as Cassandre in a justly celebrated 2003 staging of Berlioz’s “Les Troyens,” and a first line — “The Greeks have disappeared” — delivered with shellshocked starkness. ZACHARY WOOLFE AT 26 MINUTES 5 SECONDS Andy Akiho’s spirited concerto “Ricochet,” which had its American premiere this week with the New York Philharmonic, is written for violin, percussion and … Ping-Pong. At David Geffen Hall, the dramatic table-tennis passages unfolded on a platform behind the orchestra, a staging that lacked some of the drama of the concerto’s world premiere in Shanghai. There, as you can see in this video, balls were free to fall anywhere, which made the chaotic finale all more thrilling as tubs of Ping-Pong balls were dumped onto the table. The percussive sound of the balls lingers as they bounce and roll, falling onto the floor and into the audience. It’s like a fermata on the final chord of a symphony, put through the prism of Mr. Akiho’s imagination. JOSHUA BARONE “Watch Ping-Pong Make Its New York Philharmonic Debut” AT 54 SECONDS I was sad to miss the performance this week of Christopher Rouse’s Organ Concerto, with Paul Jacobs as the soloist, to inaugurate the newly installed Noack pipe organ at St. Paul’s Chapel downtown. But I heard the concerto last spring, when the Los Angeles Philharmonic performed it with Mr. Jacobs playing Hurricane Mama, as Walt Disney Concert Hall’s stunning organ is known. The piece is three movements and roughly 20 minutes, though it has the feel of one long, rollicking finale, in which Mr. Rouse repeatedly subverts centuries-old clichés of the organ repertory. You can hear an example in this clip from the concerto’s 2016 premiere with the Philadelphia Orchestra. The organ briefly stands alone with a calming drone reminiscent of ecclesiastical music — only to be smashed away by loud tone clusters in the orchestra. In St. Paul’s, moments like this must have been all the more exhilarating. JOSHUA BARONE “An Organ — and Soon Another — Lands on Broadway” AT 5 MINUTES 36 SECONDS A big week for organ music in New York began even before Trinity Wall Street’s Organ Inauguration Festival celebrating the new St. Paul’s instrument, which began on Monday. On Sunday, the excellent Renée Anne Louprette performed a recital on the superb Mander pipe organ in the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on the Upper East Side, celebrating the 25th anniversary of its installation. She concluded an eclectic program with Maurice Duruflé’s Opus 5 Suite and its blockbuster Toccata. One virtuosic run follows another, perhaps best typified by finger-busting scurryings gathering speed along a single keyboard, soon countered by deft clambering on the pedals. Then it’s on to any number of other stunts. JAMES R. OESTREICH at 1 minute 5 seconds This week, I asked the superstar trio of Yo-Yo Ma, Leonidas Kavakos and Emanuel Ax to choose a favorite page from the three piano trios written by Johannes Brahms, as they began an American tour with the pieces. One of the most striking things about spending time with them was to see just how much these three artists enjoy one another, how easy their camaraderie is — and then to understand how that mutual confidence translates into their playing, with the merest glance, or the flicker of a smile, keeping them as one. DAVID ALLEN “A Lullaby, a Caress: Yo-Yo Ma, Ax and Kavakos on Brahms” AT 4 MINUTES 4 SECONDS The eminent veterans Christoph Pregardien, tenor, and Julius Drake, pianist, came together a week ago in the 92nd Street Y’s intimate Buttenwieser Hall to perform Schubert’s shattering song cycle “Winterreise,” the tale of a spurned young lover. Both artists brought deep insight to their roles, combining beautifully in sound and spirit, and creating no end of poignant moments. But I always find it hard to get past the first song, with its spoiler of sorts. The onset of gloom is dispelled for a moment — a minute, actually — with a shift to the major key that seems to bespeak a burst of optimism. But it can’t last, and the return to gloom, the entire cycle in microcosm, is inevitably crushing. Here Mr. Pregardien performs the song with Michael Gees in a 2013 release. JAMES R. OESTREICH AT 41 SECONDS The bright acoustics of Gilder Lehrman Hall at the Morgan Library & Museum seemed to pose problems, especially for sopranos, at the 47th annual George London Foundation Awards Competition Finals last week. A strong field of mezzo-sopranos fared better. Among them, Samantha Gossard, 29, from Sidney, Ohio, gave a fine account of “Wie du warst,” Octavian’s Act I aria from Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier.” But the singer who most impressed me overall was the mezzo Rihab Chaieb, 30, from Montreal, who performed an aria from Tchaikovsky’s “Jeanne d’Arc” and took one of six $10,000 awards. Here she sings four numbers, starting with “Wie du warst,” at the 2014 Mirjam Helin International Singing Competition in Finland. JAMES R. OESTREICH Advertisement",6718

Blige, Gael García Bernal, Sufjan Stevens, Common and others will perform the Oscar-nominated songs during the awards telecast. On Friday the show’s producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd announced that the ceremony will include five musical numbers. “We’re excited to have these talented artists showcase the powerful contribution music makes to filmmaking,” Mr. De Luca and Ms. Todd said in a statement. Ms. Blige will celebrate being the first person to be nominated for an acting award and an award for best original song in the same year by performing the “Mudbound” song “Mighty River,” which she wrote with Raphael Saadiq and Taura Stinson. She is nominated for best actress in a supporting role for her work in the movie. A trio of performers, including Mr. Bernal, will perform “Remember Me” from the animated film “Coco.” He will be joined by the singers Natalia LaFourcade and Miguel. In the film, Mr. Bernal provides the voice of Héctor, the skeletal sidekick of the story’s main character. Common is set to return to the Oscars stage, this time with Andra Day, for “Stand Up for Something” from “Marshall.” In 2015 he and John Legend performed “Glory” from the film “Selma.” It won that evening for best original song. Mr. Stevens will make his Oscars debut with “Mystery of Love,” which appeared in Luca Guadagnino’s “Call Me by Your Name.” After being nominated, Mr. Stevens told Vanity Fair, “I have a dirty little secret: I’ve never watched the Oscars.” Musical theater fans will also have something to tune in for. Keala Settle will bring a bit of Broadway to the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles with her performance of “This Is Me” from the musical drama “The Greatest Showman,” a film about P.T. Barnum.

For Ruth E. Carter, the costume designer for “Black Panther,” it involved a Zulu hat and a 3-D printer. In her 30 years in film, Ms. Carter has made her career putting images of African-American history and contemporary culture onscreen, from Spike Lee’s canon to “Selma” and the recent remake of “Roots.” For the Marvel blockbuster “Black Panther,” she got to envision a futuristic African alternate reality — made up of diverse tribes and untouched by colonizers. “I really wanted this movie,” Ms. Carter, 57, said. She didn’t know much about the Marvel universe when she met with the director and co-writer, Ryan Coogler, but she liked the comic books’ portrayal. “You saw people with little kufis,” she said. “You saw a tribal council happening and someone was sitting there in a suit, and then they’d have a big Maasai headdress.” To imagine the fictional African nation of Wakanda, without the influence of the Dutch, the British and other colonizers, Ms. Carter borrowed from indigenous people across the continent. During six months of preproduction, she had shoppers scouring the globe for authentic African designs, like the traditional stacked neck rings worn by the Ndebele women of South Africa. Textiles were sourced to Ghana, but many African fabrics are now printed in Holland; Ms. Carter rejected those. “I wanted to create the fabrics, and I wanted them to feel very superhero-like,” she said. There was a strict color palette, drafted by Mr. Coogler: Chadwick Boseman, who plays T’Challa, the Wakanda royal who is also the Black Panther, wears black; Danai Gurira, as the warrior Okoye, and her band of female fighters, the Dora Milaje, are in vibrant red; and Lupita Nyong’o, as the spy Nakia, part of the river tribe, is in shades of green. (Black, red and green are also the colors of the Pan-African flag.) For Mr. Coogler, blue “represented the police and authority.” She dressed Michael B. Jordan, as Black Panther’s rival, Erik Killmonger, in it. She also leaned on a visual bible created by Hannah Beachler, the production designer, which laid out the districts and culture of Wakanda. The merchant tribe is inspired by the Tuareg, ethnic Berbers of the Sahara, Ms. Carter said. The mining tribe resembles the Himba of Namibia, known for their red ocher body paint and leather headpieces. And for the artsy Step Town district, she scoured looks from an Afropunk festival in Atlanta, where “Black Panther” was shot. “She has everything you want in a collaborator,” Mr. Coogler said. “She’s experienced but still youthful and energetic, still curious and open to trying new things.” Ms. Carter said this was not the most complex production she’d ever done; “Malcolm X,” set across several eras, was even more involved. But the chance to explore Afrofuturism with “Black Panther” was meaningful to her. “It is the reason why we have a sense of pride as African-Americans,” she said. The movie “connects everything that I’ve done about slavery and about how Africans came to this country, and what happened to their culture,” she said. Here, she discusses the inspiration and design of several looks from the film. Ryan Meinerding at Marvel designs all of its superhero suits, but Ms. Carter put her stamp on the three versions made for this movie, adding a raised-triangle motif. “It has a little bit of a sheen to it,” she said. She calls the triangle “the sacred geometry of Africa, and it makes him not only a superhero, but a king, an African king.” The Black Panther first appeared onscreen in “Captain America: Civil War” in 2016, and when Mr. Boseman donned that suit and helmet for her, “we were, like, wow.” “It was majestic. The superhero thing really is something mystical,” Ms. Carter said. “And then he was doing moves and he was telling us, you know, ‘I can’t raise my arm, and I can’t breathe out of my nose.’ And we’re like, oh, O.K., that’s bad, Mr. Black Panther. We’ll change that.” For the headgear worn by T’Challa’s mother, Queen Ramonda (played by Angela Bassett), “we found a traditional Zulu married woman’s hat, complete with the ocher that makes it red, and like a hairy, furry, texture on it. It was giant, and I really wanted to see that beautiful cylindrical shape, because I’ve always seen the ones that you get in the tourist trade,” which don’t always resemble archival images. “I didn’t believe that the origins of its shape were real until I saw a real one.” The hat was the model for Ms. Bassett’s crown, which was 3-D-printed, with help from the designer Julia Körner, who specializes in wearable plastics. A rounded shoulder mantle, with a bit of African lace, was also 3-D printed. It took six months, Ms. Carter said, to get the design right. As a leader of a border tribe, W’Kabi, played by Daniel Kaluuya, is wrapped in the Wakandan version of a Lesotho blanket. “The Lesotho do these wonderful blankets with these amazing prints on them that represent their king, they represent harvest,” Ms. Carter said. “And we screen-printed on the other side with vibranium” — the fictional metal on which Wakanda runs — “silver Adinkra symbols, so that their blankets could be used as shields during fighting. We worked on those blankets from start to finish.” It was Mr. Coogler’s idea to make the blanket a shield. “What I found with African art and clothing and structures — things tend to have multiple uses,” he said. “If you see somebody wearing a beautiful cloth, not only does that cloth protect their body, but it also tells the story of their culture and their history, written on the fabric.” The costuming for Nakia, played by Ms. Nyong’o, made the broadest leaps, Ms. Carter said. The spy’s river tribe was based partly on the Suri of Ethiopia, so her traditional look was made of shells, beads and leaves. “That cultural specificity was very, very helpful,” Ms. Nyong’o said. “I looked at images of those people and their particular way of life. It’s another layer of character development.” But she also has a high-wattage fight scene in a casino in South Korea, for which she wears a striking green, high-neck, open-shoulder dress. Ms. Carter and her team designed the fabric and had it 3-D-printed. They started with a kente cloth, “extracted the line work and created a pattern, hand-painted it,” she said. It’s covered with Wakandan text — boxes with slashes inside — and it’s sexy but not revealing. “It was her Bond Girl moment,” Ms. Carter said, “but also, she could fight and move in it, and it wasn’t constricting.” Nakia’s civilian clothes were the real challenge. “It’s hard to figure out what a person’s casual looks are when they’re a war dog, a C.I.A. operative, a casino girl,” she said. “We were trying things on all the time in the fitting room.” Ms. Nyong’o said, “There were days when, like, last minute, we still didn’t know what I was going to wear.” But Ms. Carter never panicked, she said admiringly. “She’s so relaxed, in a way that is just spellbinding.” In their red and gold outfits, these spear-fighting women are the elite warriors of Wakanda. The front of the costume is beaded “in the same tradition that you see throughout Africa — the Turkana, the Maasai,” Ms. Carter said. “The overall garment has a texture as well, the same kind of striations and sacred geometry” as the Black Panther suit. The leather harnesses that cross the bodice were made by craftsmen in South Africa so that they appear to be hand-stitched, and the imposing color was chosen to make eight actresses look as bold as 80, she said. As their general, Ms. Gurira’s neckpiece is gold, not silver like her battalion’s. Ms. Carter thought through every detail of their armor for battle. “I had back story for the Dora Milaje costumes,” she said. “I had back story for Lupita. I have to have that back story, or I just can’t move a muscle.”",7848
5a905b9a410cf7000162da37,2018-02-23T18:21:10+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/arts/music/luigi-nono-american-symphony-botstein.html,Culture,"In his politics and in his music, the composer Luigi Nono favored bold moves. In his 20s, Nono joined the Italian Communist Party, and loudly held fast to the party line for decades. Neo-fascist protesters demonstrated at the 1961 premiere of his opera “Intolleranza 1960” (which will be given a rare performance on Thursday at Carnegie Hall) and Nono remained a loyal Communist to the end, visiting the Soviet Union in 1988, not long before his death. He remained similarly pledged to his chosen aesthetic. For his entire career, he was a champion of modernism, reveling in the possibilities offered by dissonance and electronic experimentation. But that reliability did not make him predictable, as a pair of New York performances demonstrates. At a packed free concert on Wednesday at the Italian Academy at Columbia University, presented by the Talea Ensemble, the violinist Karen Kim and the electronics specialist David Adamcyk gave a vivid performance of Nono’s haunted and often spare 1989 work “La Lontananza Nostalgica Utopica Futura” (roughly, “The Nostalgic Utopian Future Distance”). Nono wrote that the piece “is not in any circumstances a concerto for solo and accompaniment.” As Ms. Kim paced among a half-dozen music stands scattered between sections of the audience, she embraced this peculiar evocation of instrumental unity. Her sound often seemed to recede into the landscape established by Nono’s eight channels of pretaped textures. The piped-in materials included some errant chatter and slammed doors, as well as violin motifs — these last courtesy of the great musician Gidon Kremer, who recorded them ahead of the work’s first release, on Deutsche Grammophon, not long after it was composed. Yet Ms. Kim also stood apart when necessary. She gave some of Nono’s harsh, percussive phrases a clarity that felt personal, even warmly sincere, when overriding a passage of ambient unease that had been fostered by the electronic material. She and Mr. Adamcyk also fashioned some mystical balances when arranging Nono’s stray polyphonic whorls in this surround-sound environment. During these moments, the division between Mr. Kremer’s recording and Ms. Kim’s live playing remained perceptible. Yet the harmony suggested a collapsing of the distance between identities and perspectives — if only for a utopian moment — before the textures inevitably diverged once again. In a program essay, the critic Paul Griffiths noted that this work was written nearly 20 years after the “heady days” of the late-1960s protest movements. He hears in “La Lontananza” its composer’s “widespread alienation from a world in cultural decay, of people living in distance from each other, and from themselves.” The performance on Wednesday, sensitive though it was, did carry some of that sense of ennui. It was less a call to action than to reflection. Anyone looking for the more overtly impassioned, idealistic Nono will have an opportunity when “Intolleranza 1960” is performed on Thursday by the American Symphony Orchestra. The 75-minute work is a dizzying succession of brief, powerful scenes as a migrant worker stumbles upon a political protest that in turn delivers him to a jail where torture is routine. The American Symphony’s music director, Leon Botstein, said that Nono’s varied writing for chorus, as well as some ferocious orchestral textures, would be electrifying under any political circumstances. But in a recent interview, he added that “the reason to do this was not only to keep the achievements of radical musical modernism alive.” Comparing Nono’s dramatization of xenophobic politics to the current debate over immigration, Mr. Botstein said, “Here’s this foreign worker being harassed and tortured — and we’re looking right at it,” adding that the performance would arrive just days before the protected status of the undocumented immigrants brought here as children, often referred to as Dreamers, expired on March 5. In the opera’s fifth scene, a chorus of the tortured seems to address the audience directly. “And all of you there?” a translation by Todd Portnowitz renders it. “Are you deaf? Complicit in the herd? In vile shame? Do the cries of our brothers not stir you?” Mr. Botstein asked, “What are we going to do when in fact people start disappearing from our midst, legally?” He said he hoped that this would be the question in the minds of those hearing “Intolleranza 1960.” Mr. Botstein seemed far less worried about whether the mainstream classical audience was still as hostile as it once was to Nono’s dissonances. “Modernism has left more of a residue than we remember,” he said, “whether you hear it in Bernard Herrmann scores, or in the sound world that accompanies the visual media we have now. The audience is going to be less shocked. The question is, will the audience be moved? In that sense, he wants to do the same thing that late Beethoven does.”",4904

Read more on the history of nepotism and politics here, and on Jared Kushner’s role here.   When Ivanka Trump traveled to Pyeongchang, South Korea, to attend the Olympic closing ceremony, President Trump tweeted: “My daughter, Ivanka, just arrived in South Korea. We cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country.” “Why? Is there some rule against it?” a critic responded. The irony escaped the president, no doubt, since he was not embarrassed to send his daughter as the bookend of Kim Jong-un’s sister, who was dubbed “the Ivanka Trump of North Korea” when she made a splash at the opening ceremony. Giving a family member such a prominent role is natural for a fearful, insecure leader with autocratic impulses, just as is it for Mr. Kim. Yet no American president before Mr. Trump has given such an underqualified son or daughter a White House post, and Ms. Trump’s tenure demonstrates why. Her appointment as senior adviser affords Ms. Trump a global platform for her private clothing and beauty products business and personal brand. Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, hired a Hollywood publicist — who recently quit — to join them in the White House, and in soft-focus interviews, her books and social media feeds, she’s portrayed as a savvy entrepreneur who cares about women. Her supporters said she went to Washington to serve — as an advocate for liberal-leaning causes from the environment to human trafficking, and as a moderating influence on her father. In reality, the self-proclaimed “Daddy’s girl” followed her father to the White House for the same reason she followed him into Manhattan real estate, and onto the set of “The Apprentice”: because she’s a Trump. In her latest role, John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, privately accuses her of “playing government,” toggling between roles as presidential adviser and presidential daughter to suit herself. Ms. Trump has made a splash around the world. But what’s been her influence on American policy, and on her father? Ms. Trump took her job in Washington not long before the release of her book, “Women Who Work.” The  title echoes a hashtag created to sell Ivanka Trump-branded clothes and shoes. In the preface, Ms. Trump wrote that her father’s presidency provided her an opportunity to “advocate for change on a far greater scale than I’d ever imagined,” leading to new ideas “in the areas I am deeply passionate about, including the education and economic empowerment of women and girls; leveling the playing field for female entrepreneurs and job creators; and advancing the potential of women in our economy.” Ms. Trump declared paid family leave to be her signature domestic policy issue, and launched herself as a global advocate for women’s empowerment. She is omnipresent in White House meetings, on subjects from manufacturing employment to women in technology, and has conducted a charm offensive in Congress. She and Mr. Kushner invite legislators, lobbyists and C.E.O.s to their Washington home for off-the-record discussions of their agenda. During Mr. Trump’s first trip abroad in May, Ms. Trump raised eyebrows when she briefly represented her father at the Group of 20 Summit in Hamburg, taking a seat alongside Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. She was jeered when she called her father “a tremendous champion of supporting families” during a women’s entrepreneurship panel in Berlin. “Whom are you representing?” the moderator asked. “Your father as the president of the United States, the American people, or your business?” It’s an apt question. Ms. Trump chose a formal, unpaid administration role, requiring her to comply with federal conflict of interest and ethics rules. Yet she and Mr. Kushner have retained financial control of their businesses and have made repeated errors on federal financial disclosures. CNN reported Thursday that the F.B.I. is investigating one of Ms. Trump’s business deals, in Vancouver. She hawked her book on Twitter, and has used public appearances to tout Ivanka Trump-branded jewelry and showcase Trump family businesses. Ms. Trump’s zeal for global renown has been exploited by foreign governments eager to curry favor with her father, just as her husband’s financial travails have been exploited. On the day Mr. Trump and the Kushners met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, China granted Ms. Trump’s company three trademarks in the giant Chinese market; other countries have done likewise. But where are Ms. Trump’s public policy successes? Language supporting paid family leave appeared in Mr. Trump’s initial budget blueprint, which went nowhere in Congress. There have been executive orders and working groups promoting women in technology, apprenticeships and job training, but no significant government funding, programs or legislation. Her White House detractors deride Ms. Trump’s causes as a “pet agenda,” vigorously opposed by the Republican base her father strives to satisfy. As Mr. Trump targeted undocumented immigrants, women, working families, gay people and the poor, as he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and tried repeatedly to deprive working families of health insurance under Obamacare, Ms. Trump defended herself, telling Gayle King, “I would say not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence … Where I disagree with my father, he knows it.” The interview earned her late-night-TV ridicule as “complicit” in her father’s atavistic policies. In another interview, Ms. Trump declared the Syrian refugee crisis a “global humanitarian crisis … we have to solve,” then evaded a question of whether her father’s travel ban, which, among other groups, specifically bars Syrian refugees from the United States, is part of the problem. Last summer Ms. Trump toured the nation cheerleading for tax cuts that penalize working families, while enriching her own family. A child tax credit she favored failed a key Senate vote after she skipped the debate over it, instead traveling to  India for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. After Mr. Trump blamed “many sides” for a violent neo-Nazi demonstration in Charlottesville, Va., in which a young counterprotester was killed, Ms. Trump, who converted to Judaism when she married Mr. Kushner, tweeted an anodyne rejection of “racism, white supremacy and neo-Nazis.” She said nothing more pointed than that about her father’s remarks, which caused C.E.O.s to bolt White House advisory boards. During an interview in South Korea last week, Ms. Trump was asked whether she believed women’s accusations of sexual misconduct and assault against her father. Ms. Trump, a senior presidential adviser who profits personally from her support for women’s empowerment, took umbrage. “I don’t think that’s a question you would ask many other daughters,” she said, before going to say she believes “my father.” What a perfect summary of what’s wrong with White House nepotism. Since she is the president’s daughter, Ms. Trump considers herself immune from criticism or tough questions even when she’s acting in her public role as a “senior adviser.” In fact, of course, no policymaker truly committed to the agenda Ms. Trump espouses would have joined this administration. No presidential adviser with the values she claims would still be working for a president so determined to lay waste to them. So why does Ms. Trump stay? The answers could only be family allegiance, personal gain, or plans — wildly optimistic plans, in light of the F.B.I. noose tightening around this White House — for a dynastic political career. These are precisely what the founders condemned as nepotism’s dangers to democracy. Ivanka Trump isn’t serving America, she is serving the Trumps.",7825
5a98a82e410cf7000162ec77,2018-03-02T01:25:59+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/opinion/jared-kushner-donald-trump-nepotism.html,Editorial,"This is the second part of an editorial series on nepotism in the White House. Read more on the history of nepotism and politics here, and on Ivanka Trump’s role here. For a Middle East negotiator, President Trump could have chosen a seasoned envoy trusted by all stakeholders and fluent in the region’s nuance. Instead he appointed the heir to an opaque Manhattan real estate empire with deep ties to Israel who boasts that, as a businessman, “I don’t care about the past.” To lead his initiative on government innovation, Mr. Trump could have named a dynamic authority on technology and entrepreneurship. Instead he chose someone who failed in an expensive effort to bring a New York newspaper into the digital age. When selecting his closest adviser, Mr. Trump could have chosen from among seasoned and wise strategists. Instead, he picked a political novice with no experience in government. For all of these crucial roles, Mr. Trump turned to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Though Mr. Trump voices high praise for Mr. Kushner’s talent, the fact that he’s family is qualification enough for a president obsessed with close-lipped loyalty and uninterested in policy unless it benefits himself. So one year in, what has Mr. Kushner accomplished? The answers point to why, from the nation’s founding to the present day, the architects of American democracy have tried so mightily to restrict the hiring of presidential relatives. Mr. Kushner’s achievements have not only been paltry, but he is directly implicated in some of the president’s most destructive — and self-destructive — decisions, as well as in some of the most serious accusations of self-dealing that have been made against the administration. For more than two centuries, the principle that federal officials would be selected on the basis of merit, not heredity, has been protected as much by tradition, cultural norms and a desire to avoid the appearance of impropriety as it has been by law. That has proved an insufficient bulwark against an insecure, ignorant president, and his administration, and the American people, are now paying the price. What a liability Mr. Kushner has proved to be. American officials have intercepted conversations in which at least four countries, including China and the United Arab Emirates, discussed ways to take advantage of Mr. Kushner’s indebtedness, naïveté and ignorance of foreign policy to further their interests, according to The Washington Post. This week, The Times reported that Kushner Companies received hundreds of millions of dollars in loans through American companies, including Citigroup and the private equity firm Apollo Global Management, after their top executives met with Mr. Kushner in the White House. The Qatari government’s investment fund was a major investor in Apollo’s real estate trust. This was all occurring while Mr. Kushner had access to top-secret intelligence, despite having failed to secure a permanent security clearance. His faulty disclosures of his financial interests and foreign contacts and his indebtedness have most likely held up his clearance for more than a year. His access was downgraded this week from top secret to secret, hardly reassuring. Mr. Kushner leads the Office of American Innovation. This was once a forum for seeking ideas from the nation’s top corporate executives, who served in advisory roles. But most of them resigned after Mr. Trump defended neo-Nazi protesters in the aftermath of a deadly riot in Charlottesville, Va. The office’s effort to continue the overhaul of outmoded government computer networks, begun under President Obama, has been slowed, according to people working on the project, partly because many government agencies lack chief information officers and other experts to implement the change. Mr. Kushner is partly responsible for the vacancies. Even though Chris Christie, then governor of New Jersey, was running a credible presidential transition, Mr. Kushner helped oust him. (When Mr. Christie was a United States attorney he sent Mr. Kushner’s father, Charles, to federal prison for tax evasion, illegal campaign donation and witness tampering.) Of the nearly 640 key Senate-confirmed positions that President Trump can appoint, fewer than half have been confirmed — the most laggard staffing record in decades. The innovation office was also supposed to focus on the opioid crisis, but a comprehensive list of recommendations written by a presidential commission last year are mostly gathering dust. Mr. Kushner holds a broad foreign policy portfolio, with responsibility for Mexico, Canada, China, and Middle East peace efforts. The Kushner family’s friendship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Kushner Companies’ extensive business ties to Israel fueled skepticism among Palestinian leaders. Any hopes of progress were effectively dashed when the president recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a coup for Israel for which the United States got nothing in return. Finally, there’s Mr. Kushner’s role as senior presidential adviser. Mr. Kushner’s multiple contacts with Kremlin-connected Russians while helping to run Mr. Trump’s campaign and transition are now part of the special counsel’s inquiry into whether Trump operatives colluded with Russia’s effort to swing the campaign in Mr. Trump’s favor. Fortified by Mr. Kushner’s advice, Mr. Trump fired F.B.I. Director James Comey, hoping to derail the investigation. This colossally foolish decision led to Robert Mueller’s appointment as special counsel, and the beginning of a criminal investigation that could range widely through Team Trump’s finances and connections. Mr. Kushner pushed for the hiring of Paul Manafort as Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, despite Mr. Manafort’s history of shadowy lobbying contracts with Kremlin allies. He also backed Michael Flynn’s appointment as national security adviser, a job he lost after he lied about discussing American sanctions against Moscow with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. Mr. Manafort is now under indictment, charged by Mr. Mueller with a range of financial crimes, including that he concealed years of lobbying for the pro-Russia government in Ukraine, and laundered millions of dollars in proceeds from that work. Mr. Flynn has pleaded guilty to making false statements to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and is cooperating with the special counsel. Some of those conversations, portrayed in the indictment as part of a coordinated effort by Trump aides to create foreign policy before they were in power, were apparently at the direction of Mr. Kushner. Mr. Kushner attended the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked Russians who promised “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. When news of that meeting leaked last year, Mr. Trump initially said the topic was adoptions. The truth later came out, and the meeting is part of the F.B.I. inquiry. In December of 2016, Mr. Kushner held a private meeting with Sergey Gorkov, who runs a Kremlin-connected Moscow bank under sanctions by the United States. A White House official said the meeting was under the auspices of the presidential transition, while the Russians said Mr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as head of Kushner Companies. Federal and congressional investigators say the meeting may have been part of an effort by Mr. Kushner to establish a direct line to President Vladimir Putin of Russia outside established diplomatic channels. Mr. Kushner said his failure to disclose the Trump Tower meeting, the Gorkov meeting and scores of other foreign contacts as part of his application for security clearance was an error. At this point, the right question to ask is why Mr. Kushner still has any diplomatic role at all. The Kushner family is scouring the globe for investors to shoulder billions in debt and redevelopment costs that Jared Kushner encumbered the company with when he bought a skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue, at a record price for the time. How handy, then, that Mr. Kushner, who still owns a hefty stake in the Kushner Companies, is Mr. Trump’s chief liaison with some two dozen nations, often operating outside formal guidance by the State Department or the National Security Council. After the election, Mr. Kushner met with Anbang Insurance Group, a conglomerate closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party, about a joint venture in the 666 Fifth Avenue project, potentially worth billions, even though Anbang’s shadowy ownership had drawn national security concerns. The talks ended after a storm of Democratic outrage, but that didn’t stop the Kushners from continuing to trawl for Chinese investments, using Mr. Kushner’s big White House job as a lure. Last May, Mr. Kushner’s sister Nicole Meyer mentioned her brother and Mr. Trump in a pitch to Chinese investors in Beijing. This time the Kushners were seeking $150 million in financing for a Jersey City housing development, through the EB-5 visa program, derided as “U.S. citizenship for sale” because it awards foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in American enterprises with a path to citizenship. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Kushner Companies’ past use of the EB-5 visa program. Federal prosecutors have sought records on Kushner Companies from Deutsche Bank, which over the years has lent hundreds of millions to the Kushner and Trump family businesses. Last week, the New York State Department of Financial Services, which regulates New York and some international banks, asked Deutsche Bank, Signature Bank and several others for information about their relationships with Mr. Kushner and his finances, The Wall Street Journal reported. Mr. Kushner has spent his career until now inside a cocoon of family wealth and connections. Former associates say that as chief executive of Kushner Companies and as owner of the struggling New York Observer, which the Kushners bought in 2006, Mr. Kushner disregarded relevant experience and rules, leaving it to lawyers to clean up after his mistakes. It’s beginning to dawn on Mr. Kushner that Washington doesn’t work like that. And the walls seem to be closing in on him. Mr. Kelly, the chief of staff, has been working to narrow Mr. Kushner’s lane, and limit his access to classified material and briefings. But as F.B.I. investigators circle the West Wing and extend their scrutiny to the Kushner businesses, Mr. Kushner might still want the protective umbrella of the White House. Clearly, Americans deserve better from their public servants, but the law doesn’t provide sufficient protection from a president who doesn’t get that. Firming up the anti-nepotism law to cover White House advisers has been criticized as an infringement on a president’s right to seek private personal counsel. But Congress could require that presidential appointees across the federal government possess relevant credentials and experience, that they meet enforceable performance metrics, and — do we really need to say this? — that they can pass a background check. If Mr. Kushner’s performance inspires such reforms, it could prove his only real achievement.",11171

Read more on Jared Kushner’s role here, and on Ivanka Trump’s role here. Donald Trump has broken with so many conventions of the American presidency that it can be hard to track them all. Some of his supporters would argue that they elected him to explode outmoded Washington ways. But many of these conventions were meaningful curbs on presidential behavior and power. One of Mr. Trump’s most disturbing departures from tradition was his appointment of close relatives to positions at the very apex of government power. We are now seeing consequences of that ethical break, as the extraordinary access to government secrets of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has finally been constrained by White House officials concerned about his lack of full security clearance. Meanwhile, The Times has reported that Mr. Kushner’s family business has received loans from the companies of people with whom he met in the White House. The president’s repeated deployment of his daughter Ivanka as a diplomat has also come under heavy criticism. Mr. Trump was, of course, accustomed to relying on family members in the private sector, a world in which relatives can be literally reared in the business. A legacy of family control has helped sustain many private companies, including The New York Times. But it has never been embraced in public service by Americans, who left family governance behind when they rejected a monarchy to form the United States. Still, presidents throughout history have been tempted to hire their relatives, so much so that 50 years ago Congress finally passed a law forbidding such nepotism. (It was Mr. Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, who helped set a precedent for family employment that the Trumps are now exploiting.) Mr. Trump’s dependence on relatives with no government experience has demonstrated the corrosive effect of such nepotism: Even an incompetent in-law can reject the directions of the most experienced staff members; access — the currency of government — is unchecked; dismissal is difficult no matter how deserved; and ethical standards are near-impossible to enforce. “The public will never be made to believe that an appointment of a relative is made on the ground of merit alone, uninfluenced by family views,” Thomas Jefferson warned. “Nor can they ever see with approbation offices, the disposal of which they entrust to their Presidents for public purposes, divided out as family property.” Almost from the beginning, presidents have struggled to reconcile this notion with their instinct to reward, and benefit from, familial loyalty. None has so blithely ignored this conflict as Mr. Trump. Public service can certainly be a family legacy in the United States, and name recognition is crucial to successful campaigns. So voters have proved willing to accept, or to be enticed by, a candidate’s family connections, from the Adamses, to the Roosevelts, to the Kennedys, to the Bushes, to the 2016 presidential primary featuring the brother and son of two former presidents and the wife of yet another. But Americans’ aversion to presidential nepotism has also been deep and lasting, even as presidents have tested it. Jefferson was furious when John Adams appointed his son John Quincy Adams, already an accomplished diplomat, as the nation’s first minister to Prussia. While even the younger Adams objected, his father retorted,  “The sons of Presidents have the Same Claim to Liberty, Equality and the benefit of the Laws with all other Citizens.” Until 1857, presidents paid for their own White House staffs, and many named relatives to these jobs. But after the assassination of James Garfield by a thwarted patronage seeker led to the creation of the Civil Service system in 1883, presidential relatives served chiefly as informal advisers and envoys because of popular revulsion with the spoils system. When critics said Franklin Roosevelt’s appointment of his son James as White House secretary in 1937 allowed the young Roosevelt to enrich himself in the insurance business, in consult with his father he released five years of tax returns to prove otherwise. It was John F. Kennedy’s appointment of his brother Robert as attorney general that led to the first antinepotism law, in 1967. It prohibited presidents and members of Congress from appointing or promoting relatives and spouses “in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control.” The Justice Department has cited that law in a half-dozen legal opinions that prevented Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama from appointing relatives to roles as minor as unpaid clerical assistant. In 1972, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel opined that the law “extends to any appointment to a ‘civilian position’ over which the president exercises jurisdiction or control” and that “it seems clearly applicable to subordinate positions on the White House staff.” The Justice Department again cited the 1967 law in blocking Mr. Carter’s plan to name his wife, Rosalynn, to lead a commission on mental health, even though first ladies have often been powerful informal advisers to their husbands. Then Bill Clinton pushed the boundaries between informal adviser and government employee by naming his wife, Hillary Clinton, to lead a White House task force on health care. There is no public evidence he sought the Justice Department’s opinion on the legality of the appointment. But when a lawsuit accused the administration of violating a federal law that requires presidential advisory committees with any nongovernmental members to make their records public,  the court maintained that Mrs. Clinton was in essence a federal employee, preventing the task force from being fully subject to the disclosure law. In a twist of history, the acceptance of Mrs. Clinton’s role handed her nemesis Donald Trump justification for putting his own relatives in power and running the White House like his private real estate business. In a January 2017 ruling, Daniel Koffsky, a career lawyer in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, noted that the court said that Mrs. Clinton’s appointment to a White House position did not violate the antinepotism law. He also said that a 1978 statute governing White House appointments granted the president “special hiring authority,” a position many ethics experts criticized. The ruling allowed Mr. Trump to give his daughter Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner, her husband, White House offices and virtually unfettered access to the cabinet and world leaders. The couple’s many businesses offer foreign allies and adversaries a channel for seeking to influence American policy, fueling suspicion that the Trumps and Mr. Kushner are leveraging public office for private gain. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that officials of at least four countries have discussed ways to manipulate the inexperienced Mr. Kushner by taking advantage of his family’s financial difficulties and business entanglements. Mr. Kushner’s family has tried to leverage his position, too. They broadcast his role in the administration as part of a real estate sales pitch in Beijing, touting a controversial program that grants foreigners American visas in exchange for investments in development projects. On the same day as Mr. Trump’s first meeting with President Xi Jinping of China — who was serenaded by the president’s grandchildren — Ms. Trump’s company was awarded three trademarks in the Chinese market. After the meeting, the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing think tank, described the Trump White House as a tribal battleground dominated by the “Trump family clan.” The New Yorker quoted the think tank’s assessment that the Trump family seems to “directly influence final decisions” on business and international relations in a way that “has rarely been seen in the political history of the United States.” The analysis used an ancient Chinese expression meaning “to treat the state as your possession,” a feudal concept of governance that conflicts with basic American principles. Appalling as it is, White House nepotism is only one element of Mr. Trump’s broader determination to install unqualified friends, patrons and political lackeys across the government. The founders would have dreaded a president like Mr. Trump. His behavior is a warning that ethical traditions and culture are not enough. Lawmakers need to harden some of these norms into law, to safeguard the executive branch and the public trust from future presidents eager to use America’s highest office to benefit their families.",8706

Andrew Cuomo may need a raw steak to go with the ziti that was an ingredient in the courtroom drama. The steak would be for the black eye he has suffered in this corruption case, now in the jury’s hands. Nothing in this tawdry affair works to his benefit. If Mr. Percoco, the governor’s former aide and family friend, is convicted of charges that he took gobs of bribe money — ziti, in his “Sopranos”-inflected argot — it will reflect poorly on Mr. Cuomo. But even if the verdict is not guilty, the ethical pall over Albany and its chief executive will not be dispelled. Bribery described as pasta has a way of sticking in people’s heads. “This is not how honest and honorable public servants talk,” a federal prosecutor, David Zhou, correctly noted to the jurors on Tuesday. Even without government allegations of wrongdoing by Mr. Cuomo, he doesn’t quite hit all the right ethical notes. In this regard, he is not alone. His political nemesis, Mayor Bill de Blasio, is destined to be haunted by one Harendra Singh, a restaurant owner who, it was recently reported, secretly pleaded guilty to bribing Mr. de Blasio in return for help getting favorable lease terms. No charges were brought against the mayor or his aides. Federal prosecutors noted last year that making a case would have been difficult, presumably because the United States Supreme Court had raised the bar for proving political corruption months before Mr. Singh’s plea in 2016. Nonetheless, the specter of shadowy behavior isn’t going away, not with Mr. Singh figuring in another federal corruption trial about to begin, that of Edward Mangano, a former Nassau County executive. He’s accused of taking Singh bribes. Mr. Mangano’s lawyers have left little doubt that they will make Mr. Singh’s de Blasio connection — and the absence of any charges against the mayor — part of a strategy to discredit him as a prosecution witness. For Mr. Cuomo, who’s up for re-election this year, discomfiting proximity to criminal cases does not end with the Percoco trial. Another administration insider, Alain Kaloyeros, has his own federal court date in May. Dr. Kaloyeros, who headed the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, is charged with corruption in connection with pay-to-play projects upstate. Courthouses aside, the governor has trouble keeping his deeds fully in sync with his words on ethics. He has repeatedly urged the Legislature to close the “L.L.C. loophole,” by which corporate interests pump vast sums into political campaigns through a series of limited liability companies. No action has been taken, a failure arguably more on lawmakers than on Mr. Cuomo. But having claimed the high ground, he could show seriousness of purpose by not slipping through that loophole himself. Instead, he has used it to plow many hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate donors into a campaign strongbox containing more than $30 million. Similarly, he renewed an executive order imposed by a predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, under which most people in state positions are forbidden to donate to, or solicit political donations for, the governor who appointed them. But Mr. Cuomo and his counsel interpret the order as applying solely to those who can be fired by the governor at any moment. It doesn’t cover people who’ve had legislative confirmation and serve fixed terms, they say. That smacks of pettifoggery. A Times investigation disclosed this week that 37 Cuomo appointees contributed a total of $2.2 million to his political campaign, directly or through relatives and companies they own or control. No one can expect the governor to cease trawling for campaign cash in an election year, and not when he has his eye on a possible presidential race in 2020. But a serious challenger to his re-election has yet to emerge. With his bursting campaign chest, how hard would it have been to forgo a couple of million to demonstrate he’s sticking to both the spirit of the rules and his own ethics agenda? In some circles, that’s called walking the walk.",4098

In a detailed 101-page opinion, the judge rejected a challenge by the State of California and several environmental groups to the administration’s waiver of environmental laws that could have held up the wall’s construction. “Big legal win today,” Mr. Trump tweeted around 11:30. “U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!” So far so good. Mr. Trump is entitled, no less than other presidents, to celebrate his administration’s victories in court — even if he does so in a bathrobe. What he failed to mention, though, was the name of the judge who issued the ruling: Gonzalo Curiel, of the Southern District of California. Judge Curiel, you may recall, was on Mr. Trump’s radar in May 2016, soon after Mr. Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for president. At the time, Judge Curiel was presiding over a long-running class-action lawsuit against Trump University, which had been accused of defrauding customers who spent $1,500 for three-day seminars that promised to reveal Mr. Trump’s real estate secrets. Mr. Trump, who refuses to be held to account for anything he has ever said or done, was irked that a federal judge would dare to entertain litigation against him. At a rally in San Diego, Mr. Trump called Judge Curiel “very hostile,” “a very bad judge” and a “hater of Donald Trump,” and said he “should be ashamed of himself. I think it’s a disgrace that he’s doing this.” He added that Judge Curiel “happens to be, we believe, Mexican.” Not true: Judge Curiel was born and raised in Indiana. But the implication, of course, was that Mr. Trump, who had begun his own candidacy with derogatory comments about Mexicans and had been pushing a border wall with Mexico throughout the campaign, could not get a fair trial from a “Mexican” judge. Less than two years later, in a case involving the border wall itself, that same judge ruled in Mr. Trump’s favor. He is no longer a “very bad judge,” apparently. It’s possible that Mr. Trump simply forgot who Judge Curiel is. More likely, he knows full well and doesn’t care. What he cares about is protecting his delicate ego, and repairing any damage to it inflicted by people who don’t show a sufficient degree of respect or self-abasement. This all-consuming self-interest leads him to change his opinion of people and institutions, depending on how he thinks they are treating him at that moment. Laws and norms, ethics and principles? Meaningless concepts. In Mr. Trump’s world, nothing is sacred and everything is transactional. This is a man who is so much more interested in winning than in governing that he filed for re-election the same day he was inaugurated. It’s the core of who he is, as almost anyone who has had even a glancing dealing with him over the years — especially in real estate, where nothing matters but the sale — will attest. If you help him or say nice things about him, you’re the best. If you get in his way or criticize him, you’re unfair, dishonest, terrible. Failing, even. Ask “Liddle” Bob Corker, the Tennessee senator who earned Mr. Trump’s outrage by criticizing the Republican tax bill, then seemed to get back on the president’s good side with a few empathetic words. Or Senator John McCain, who is dealing with terminal brain cancer even as Mr. Trump keeps mocking him for his vote last year against repealing Obamacare. Or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was Mr. Trump’s first and most ardent supporter in the Senate, but who has secured a spot in the president’s doghouse after recusing himself from the Russia investigation. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump fired yet another broadside at Mr. Sessions, complaining that his failure to investigate alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is “disgraceful” — in all caps, naturally. None of this is remotely surprising anymore, but even so, Mr. Trump’s tweet about Judge Curiel’s border-wall decision revealed once again the depths of the president’s own self-interest and his utter lack of principles. When this is the driving force of the commander in chief, and it is aimed at our governmental and social institutions, it is profoundly destructive. Shortly after the 2016 rally where he disparaged the competence, integrity and ethnicity of Judge Curiel, Mr. Trump was asked why he did not just settle the Trump University case and be done with it. After predicting that he would win outright, he said: “I could settle that case. … I don’t want to settle the case. Because you know what? Because I’m a man of principle.” (In November 2016, days after he won the election, Mr. Trump settled, eventually paying $25 million.) Fortunately, as this tale reveals, there are in fact still people of principle in public service, and they’re doing important work every day to preserve our institutions and counteract this president’s worst impulses. Judge Curiel, for one, has continued to do his job, carefully applying the law to the cases that come before him, no matter how obnoxious the litigants might be. In his ruling on Tuesday, the judge acknowledged the “heated political debate” surrounding the border wall, and quoted a passage on the role of courts by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. — who, he slyly noted, is a “fellow Indiana native”: “Courts are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our nation’s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.” That is what being a public servant in America sounds like, and it requires a level of selflessness and devotion to democratic ideals that is alien to Mr. Trump.",6205
5a973d80410cf7000162e88a,2018-02-28T23:38:36+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/opinion/eu-polish-nationalism.html,Editorial,"Since coming to power in Poland in 2015, the nationalist Law and Justice party has enacted one outrageous measure after another, placing the nation’s courts under political control, trying to do the same with the news media, purging the civil service and, most recently, criminalizing any suggestion of Polish complicity in the Holocaust. Behind these moves runs a concerted and dangerous rewriting of history to create a narrative of heroic Polish victimhood — under the Nazis and Communists, of course, but also as a maligned defender of traditional values against a degenerate and controlling European Union. There is more than a little irony in the way Poland has turned on the European Union. Billions in the union’s funds have been used to build Poland’s highways and roads, sewage systems, kindergartens and other facilities. Poland’s exports, largely to other member countries, have boomed, and young Poles travel and work all across Europe. The countryside, where support for Law and Justice is particularly strong, has been among the biggest recipients of the union’s largess. Biting the hand that feeds it is a gentle way of putting it. Nonetheless, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the real power behind Law and Justice, has built his populist appeal on resisting what he describes as the European Union’s effort to dictate cosmopolitan cultural terms (and immigrant quotas). To portray the bloc’s policies as oppressive is ludicrous, but as Steven Erlanger and Marc Santora of The Times recently wrote, Law and Justice has thrived on contrasting a “conservative, Catholic Poland and its family values with a godless, freethinking, gender-bending Western Europe.” There has always been a dollop of victimhood in the Polish national narrative, largely for sound reasons, given Poland’s history of partitions. But for Mr. Kaczynski — as for some other populist leaders in Eastern and Central Europe, most notably Hungary — the purpose of rewriting history in this way is to gain power. The Holocaust law is meant to enforce the image of Poles solely as martyrs, never collaborators; when the president signed the laws bringing the courts under political power, the current defense minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, proclaimed it the official end of Communism in Poland. And throughout the narrative, Law and Justice, under Mr. Kaczynski and his late twin brother, a President Lech Kaczynski, is seen as the bastion of real Polish democracy. In fact, what the Polish government is doing is eroding democracy, and Europe must do what it can to defend its founding principles of “democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.” The union has already taken the unprecedented step of warning Warsaw that it could lose its voting rights in the organization if it carries on. It may not be easy for the European Union to follow through on that threat, since Hungary, for one, has vowed to veto any such sanction. But it cannot back down. If Hungary does cast a veto, the bloc could divert some of the aid that flows to Poland, and diplomats from other members could minimize contacts with Warsaw. Mr. Kaczynski will no doubt scream “diktat,” but it will come with a price.",3177

They wait, usually with Job-like patience, for a long-overdue train to pull into the station. They wait stoically at home for a store delivery promised for some time between 10 a.m. and never. They waited nearly a century for a Second Avenue subway line — and even then got only a few stations. So it is not surprising that New Yorkers wait calmly for their governor and mayor to move forcefully on two important transportation ideas with a potential to transform travel in the city. One is congestion pricing, the other a streetcar line that would connect Brooklyn and Queens along their shared waterfront. But patience is not infinite. The two leaders would do well to hear a tapping of feet that signals the public’s desire for action. On congestion pricing, nearly six weeks have passed since a task force handed Gov. Andrew Cuomo its recommendations to make drivers pay to enter the overcrowded core of Manhattan: $11.52 for cars, $25.34 for trucks, and per-ride surcharges of $2 to $5 for taxis and app-based services like Uber, Lyft and Via. The twofold goal is to ease strangling traffic and raise money for mass transit — as much as $1.5 billion a year by the task force’s estimates. Granted, six weeks isn’t an eternity. But the congestion pricing concept is years old, and making it a reality is long overdue. Mr. Cuomo is said to have begun leaning on wary lawmakers, and he has taken a few preliminary steps in his executive budget to get the ball rolling. They amount, however, to dipping toes in the water. Even while recognizing the political delicacy of these proposals, especially in a state election year, we’d like to see him plunge in deeply. If ever an issue cried out for a vigorous exercise of gubernatorial muscle to get lawmakers on board, this one is it. As for the streetcar plan, called the Brooklyn Queens Connector, it was put forth by Mayor Bill de Blasio two years ago. BQX, in shorthand, would run 16 miles between Sunset Park in Brooklyn and Astoria in Queens, looping through neighborhoods like Red Hook and the Brooklyn Navy Yard that qualify as mass-transit deserts. The price tag to build it is steep, $2.5 billion, and you can safely bet costs will rise because that’s always the case in New York. There’s no guarantee the mayor will include tens of millions of dollars in start-up money in the proposed budget he must submit to the City Council in a few weeks. Serious concerns loom: How big an obstacle to installing tracks is presented by the tangle of underground gas, water and sewer lines? Will there be resistance from affected neighborhoods? How will the streetcar connect to subway lines so riders can easily switch, and will the Metropolitan Transportation Authority agree to free transfers? Can the city capture a sufficient slice of rising property values along the route to bear out early claims that BQX would pay for itself? And will Mr. de Blasio decide that other priorities should get the money needed to get the project underway? To borrow from a Times colleague, the critic Michael Kimmelman, there will always be competing priorities and limited resources. However, he wrote four years ago, “a streetcar is a tangible, lasting commitment to urban change.” It’s time for the city to show it can think big on transit, and act accordingly, not leaving BQX to languish as a streetcar named aspire.",3393
5a95c157410cf7000162e481,2018-02-27T20:36:31+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/opinion/xi-jinping-power-china.html,Editorial,"President Xi Jinping of China has played his boldest political card yet, maneuvering to extend his rule indefinitely so that he can maintain control of the country’s complex system long enough to achieve the dream of great-power status, asserting economic and political influence across the globe. Since China began to open to the West in the late 1970s, the United States and its allies have tried to integrate it into the political and economic system they built after World War II, hoping that economic progress would lead eventually to political liberalization. Mr. Xi’s move proves that policy has failed and that China will set its own path, challenging the liberal order based on the rule of law, human rights, open debate, free-market economics and a preference for elected leaders who leave office peacefully after a fixed period. Despite increasing concerns about China’s evolution, the West has yet to come to grips with this threat. Since taking office in 2013, Mr. Xi has amassed power assiduously, taking control of not just the government but also of the Chinese Communist Party, the military and the press. He has imposed his views on the educational system and culture, hardening an already authoritarian system that ruthlessly controls social media and wields law enforcement to crush dissent. The obsession with control hints at a deeply insecure state, not a global power. Nevertheless, he has persuaded the party to effectively make him emperor for life by announcing plans to amend the Constitution to abolish term limits, which would have ended his presidency in 2023. The changes seem to ensure that Mr. Xi will continue pursuing his agenda, which has begun to lift millions of people out of poverty, reformed state-owned enterprises, protected the environment and built strategic industries. If all goes according to plan, he could preside over the transition when China eclipses the United States as the world’s largest economy in absolute terms within two decades. Diverging from the free-market path, Mr. Xi has involved his government more deeply in economic affairs, reining in China’s private companies and insisting on more market access abroad for Chinese businesses while limiting opportunities for foreign companies in China. That’s a major reason the Trump administration formally declared China a strategic competitor and is preparing to impose tariffs on some Chinese imports and to limit Chinese technology investments in the United States. The two sides will have a chance to discuss the matter when China’s top economic strategist, Liu He, visits Washington this week. In a break from his predecessors, Mr. Xi is also pushing a more aggressive foreign policy that includes establishing military bases in the Western Pacific and Africa, modernizing the military and starting a $1 trillion program to develop roads, bridges and power networks across Asia, Europe and Africa. He has worked to dilute international norms on human rights and interfered to an alarming extent in Australia’s political and economic life. Mr. Xi has also been touting China as an alternative model to politically strained democracies like the United States, and such ideas, fueled by Beijing’s checkbook diplomacy, have found resonance in places like Rwanda, Cambodia and Thailand. But doubling down on the strongman model is risky. By moving from an autocratic collective to one-man rule, Mr. Xi has upset the political norms that were put in place to erase the personality cult of Mao and make political transitions more predictable. The system Mr. Xi has created also makes it less likely he will receive sound policy advice or be challenged on decisions in ways that could avoid mistakes. That’s because he solidified his power base during the first term by waging an aggressive campaign against corruption and dissent, silencing political rivals and stacking the ruling Politburo with loyalists reluctant to speak up. But not all are happy. Despite the risk, a well-known political commentator and a prominent businesswoman have penned open letters urging lawmakers to reject a plan that would allow Mr. Xi’s power grab. One has to wonder what such control will do to innovation, a driver of progress in successful economies. Or whether knowing he has a job for life, Mr. Xi — who has presented himself as a benign father figure overseeing China’s peaceful rise — may be tempted by other risks, including in foreign policy. By consolidating unfettered power, Mr. Xi now owns it all. If he fails, there is no one to blame but himself. And there are many daunting problems facing China, including an aging population, a need to maintain high growth rates, and heavily indebted state-owned and private businesses. Whether Mr. Xi succeeds or fails at this experiment in dictatorship matters not just to China but the rest of the world as well. He is increasingly dominating the international space as President Trump cedes America’s traditional leadership role, including its defense of democratic norms. The American counterbalance must be more creative and comprehensive than just starting a trade war, as Mr. Trump is inclined to do. In this regard, the White House’s response to Mr. Xi’s power grab was not encouraging. “That’s a decision that would be up to China,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Monday.",5360
5a94ad23410cf7000162e1ba,2018-02-27T00:58:06+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/opinion/supreme-court-unions-afscme-mcconnell.html,Editorial,"Remember when the Senate confirmed Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, the veteran federal appeals court judge, to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died suddenly two years ago this month? It was a brilliant tactical move by Mr. Obama — picking a moderate, widely respected jurist who had won the highest praise from top Republicans, and giving the court a majority of Democratic-appointed justices for the first time in nearly half a century. Oh, right. That’s not what happened. Let’s pause to recall once again what did happen: Justice Scalia’s body wasn’t even in the ground before Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he would refuse to consider any nominee President Obama might put forward. The reason, he claimed, was the importance of letting Americans “have a voice in the selection” by voting in the presidential election, which at the time was nine months off. It was his coded way of saying he intended to preserve the court’s Republican-appointed majority at any cost. Against long odds, Mr. McConnell won. Now parked for life in the seat where Judge Garland should be sitting is the ultraconservative Neil Gorsuch, who we’re supposed to believe represents the “voice” of a citizenry that preferred Hillary Clinton by a margin of nearly three million votes. That enormously consequential swap is already having concrete effects on American society, and very likely will determine the outcome of a case the justices heard on Monday — a challenge to the ability of public-sector unions to charge nonmembers for expenses related to collective bargaining, such as negotiations over wages, hours and working conditions. The plaintiff says his First Amendment rights are violated by being forced to pay these so-called fair-share fees to a union whose political positions he disagrees with. Legally, this should be an easy win for the unions. The Supreme Court upheld fair-share fees four decades ago in a unanimous ruling it has reaffirmed repeatedly, and on which more than 20 states have relied in negotiating thousands of contracts covering millions of public employees, including firefighters, teachers and police officers. The logic is simple: When the government is an employer, it has more control over its employees’ speech than over that of regular citizens. Any burden the fees impose on employees’ First Amendment rights is justified by the need to eliminate free riders — workers who enjoy union benefits without having to pay for them, which can deplete the unions’ resources in states where they are legally required to represent all workers, members and nonmembers alike. Anti-union advocates dismiss the free-rider concern, but it’s very real: In states that have ended the fees, more than one-third of public-school teachers are free riders. None of this seems to register with Justice Samuel Alito Jr., who has made no secret of his dislike for that 1977 opinion, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, and has been searching for the votes to overturn it for at least six years, writing opinions intended to set up its demise. Justice Alito probably assumed he had victory in hand in 2016, when the court considered the same question in a case brought by California public-school teachers against their union. But when Justice Scalia, whose remarks during oral arguments strongly suggested he would provide the fifth vote against the union, died a few weeks later, the case deadlocked. As it turned out, Justice Scalia’s death only briefly slowed the march of corporate interests that have sought for years to protect their huge profits and kill off the last remnants of organized labor in America. They and the right-wing groups that support them quickly regrouped around another plaintiff, a child-support specialist from Illinois named Mark Janus, who makes the same argument the California teachers did: Activities by public-sector unions are inherently political, so it’s impossible to separate the costs of collective bargaining from those of political lobbying. No matter what benefits the unions negotiate on his behalf, he shouldn’t have to pay a dime. Mr. Janus lost decisively in the lower federal courts for the same reason the teachers did: the Supreme Court’s precedent in the Abood case. That precedent should guide the justices here, too. Beyond the court’s core principle of stare decisis, which keeps it from overturning its own prior decisions except in extraordinary circumstances, the Abood decision reasonably balanced workers’ First Amendment rights against the government’s interest in labor peace. Two notable conservative scholars go further, arguing in a supporting brief to the court that the First Amendment does not apply at all in this case. The government is allowed to compel subsidies of others’ speech all the time without violating the Constitution, they point out, such as by collecting and spending taxes. In Monday’s arguments, several of the conservative justices seemed immune to such reasoning. Justice Alito referred to fair-share fees as “compelled speech” that infringes on a worker’s “dignity and conscience.” But the true goal of this litigation strategy has never been to protect workers’ speech rights; it is, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor rightly said, “to do away with unions,” which not only make life a little harder for the world’s plutocrats, but have also become a potent organizing tool in Democratic politics. One recent paper by political scientists found Democrats’ share of the presidential vote fell 3.5 percentage points in states that eliminated fair-share fees. In Wisconsin, public-sector union membership fell by half after the state’s newly Republican leadership eliminated the fees in 2011. Justice Gorsuch was silent on Monday, but it’s hard to imagine he will vote with the unions. Since joining the court last April, Justice Gorsuch has voted nearly all of the time with the other most conservative justice, Clarence Thomas. Had the seat he occupies been filled by Merrick Garland, it’s unlikely the case would have been brought at all. Whatever the justices decide in Mr. Janus’s case, the drama that preceded it is another reminder of the importance of every Supreme Court appointment, and of the degree to which Mr. McConnell may have altered the course of history with his cynical ploy. After all, President Trump will be in power until 2025 at the latest, but Justice Gorsuch could easily be issuing opinions four decades from now.",6464

The president and Republican lawmakers quickly held up these news releases as vindication for their argument that cutting the top federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent, would boost workers’ incomes even as it added $1.5 trillion to the debt that future generations would have to pay off. Now corporate announcements and analyst reports confirm what honest observers always said — this claim is pure fantasy. As executives tell investors what they intend to do with their tax savings and their spending plans are tabulated into neat charts and graphs, the reports jibe with what most experts said would happen: Companies are rewarding their stockholders. Businesses are buying back shares, which creates demand for the stocks, boosts share prices and benefits investors. Some of the cash is going to increase dividends. And a chunk will go to acquiring other businesses, creating larger corporations that face less competition. In addition to benefiting investors, these maneuvers will end up boosting the pay of top executives because their compensation packages are often tied to the price of their companies’ stock. Finally, a small sliver of the money will find its way into paychecks of rank-and-file employees, but it won’t be a big boost and will probably come in the form of a temporary bonus, rather than a lasting raise. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated that 43 percent of corporate tax savings would go to buybacks and dividends and nearly 19 percent would help pay for mergers and acquisitions. Just 17 percent would be used for capital investment, and even a smaller share, 13 percent, would go toward bonuses and raises. Other Wall Street analysts have issued similar reports. If more evidence was needed, Axios reported that just nine pharmaceutical companies have announced $50 billion in buybacks since the tax law was passed. Mr. Trump might argue that it doesn’t much matter that the tax cuts will be a boon for investors because many Americans own stocks. The president has recently touted the rising value of 401(k) accounts as a benefit of the tax law. But roughly half of all families own no stock, and most people have holdings that are worth less than $5,000. Most stock holdings, a whopping 84 percent, are in the hands of people whose incomes put them in the top 10 percent of households. Republicans might further argue that none of this matters because the tax law is becoming more popular as people learn more about it. Indeed, a recent poll for The Times found that the law now has more supporters than opponents. But this swing in public sentiment might be less important than it appears. Consider the results of a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll that shows that just 25 percent of registered voters said they had noticed an increase in their paycheck because of lower tax withholding while 51 percent had not. The poll also found that high-income people were more likely to notice that their take-home pay had gone up. That’s because Republicans designed the law to principally benefit wealthy families while offering crumbs to low-income and middle class families. Those crumbs, by the way, disappear after a few years. Further, many taxpayers in states like California, New Jersey and New York will be hit with higher tax bills when they file their 2018 tax returns and realize that they can now only deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes. There was a legitimate argument for reforming the tax code in a way that reduced the corporate tax rate, closed loopholes and made the economy fairer and more productive. But Republicans chose a plan that rewards the rich at the expense of workers. They had to lie to make this scheme seem legitimate. Now the true effects are coming to fruition.",3954

Yet that could happen if the United States mishandles Saudi Arabia’s plans to enter the nuclear power business and erect as many as 16 nuclear reactors for electricity generation over 25 years. The Saudis aren’t saying they want to become the second country, after Israel, to have a nuclear arsenal in the increasingly unstable region. They insist the reactors would be used only to generate energy for domestic purposes, so they can rely on their huge reserves of oil to generate income from overseas. Still, there are growing signs that the Saudis want the option of building nuclear weapons to hedge against their archrival, Iran, which had a robust nuclear program before accepting severe curbs under a 2015 deal with the United States and other major powers. Obama administration efforts to negotiate an agreement on transferring civil nuclear technology — required before a country can buy American nuclear technology — faltered over the Saudis’ refusal to make a legally binding commitment to forgo uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, which could be used to produce fuel for nuclear weapons. The United Arab Emirates made a commitment like that in its 2009 agreement, setting the nonproliferation “gold standard” for civil nuclear cooperation deals. Now new negotiations are being pursued under a president who caters to the needs of American business and aggressively courts Saudi leaders. In theory, Mr. Trump is well-placed to cajole the Saudis to accept the gold standard. He can argue that it makes more sense for Riyadh to buy enriched fuels for the reactors from relatively low-cost foreign suppliers than to produce it in Saudi Arabia. Such an agreement will further cement ties with the United States, which has promised to protect the kingdom from its enemies. But there are questions about what limits the Trump administration would require, and the Saudis would accept, as part of the agreement the two sides are about to start negotiating. Insisting on strict conditions could force the Saudis to buy instead from Russia or China, which don’t impose such nonproliferation rules, or from France and South Korea, thus penalizing a moribund American nuclear industry eager for the lucrative new business. Westinghouse and other American-based companies are discussing a consortium to bid on the multibillion-dollar project. However, a failure to incorporate crucial restrictions in any deal would leave the Saudis free to repurpose the technology for nuclear weapons. That would undercut decades of American-led efforts to prevent the spread of these arms. The United States has long been a leader in nuclear technology with its sales to other countries governed by bilateral civil nuclear agreements that require adherence to nine nonproliferation criteria. They include guarantees that none of the nuclear materials provided by the United States will be used for nuclear explosives, that none of the technology or classified data will be transferred to third parties without American consent, and that the country involved in the agreement will not enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium. But Saudi officials are still insisting that they have a right to enrichment and reprocessing under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which guaranteed nations access to such technologies if they forsake nuclear weapons. If these disagreements stalemate negotiations, the United States could lose the opportunity to impose any nonproliferation, nuclear security and nuclear safety conditions on the Saudi program at all. That is why a compromise proposed by Robert Einhorn, a former American nuclear negotiator, may be worth considering, but only if efforts to set stricter standards fail. It would require the Saudis to make a legally binding commitment to forgo enrichment and reprocessing for 15 years, not indefinitely, thus kicking tough questions down the road. Ultimately, Congress must assert its right to have the final say on a deal, and set strict conditions if the administration does not. Those should include intrusive inspections of Saudi nuclear facilities, similar to those Iran has accepted. Given Mr. Trump’s flip attitude toward nuclear weapons, Congress’s responsibility affects the nuclear future of not just Saudi Arabia, but the decisions that Turkey, Egypt and other countries make about acquiring nuclear power. Lawmakers need to put protections in place so more countries don’t edge closer to having nuclear weapons.",4564
5a91c31a410cf7000162dc9d,2018-02-24T19:55:01+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/opinion/sunday/drugs-safe-injection-sites.html,Editorial,"An overdose is often a lonely way to die. Overdoses happen when a toxic amount of a drug, or a combination of drugs, overwhelms the body’s basic functions, first slowing and eventually stopping the brain’s drive to breathe. If someone notices the signs of an overdose — lips turning blue, restricted pupils, unresponsiveness, a loss of consciousness, among others — it can generally be reversed with drugs like naloxone, which saves thousands of lives a year. But someone must be there to notice. Yet one of the most consistent patterns in the more than 64,000 deaths attributed to opioid and other drug overdoses in 2016 was that the victims’ last moments went unobserved. Last year, the number of deaths was most likely even higher. In the face of this emergency, dedicated public health officials and policymakers have suggested some vital solutions. One important, rigorously tested harm-reduction method, however, is still rarely discussed in the United States: supervised drug consumption sites, also known as safe injection sites. This must change. All evidence so far shows these facilities have proved incredibly effective at slashing overdose deaths in every country that has welcomed them. If lawmakers are serious about ending the opioid crisis, American cities and states should follow their lead. At safe injection sites, trained staffs provide clean needles, administer naloxone when there are overdoses and offer long-term treatment options. People bring their own drugs — most often heroin. It may seem counterintuitive: Give drug users space and support to inject themselves with potentially deadly substances, even while encouraging them to stop. But dozens of studies suggest that these sites curtail overdose deaths and increase participation in drug treatment. Despite millions of injections that have occurred at more than 90 facilities internationally over the past three decades, not a single overdose death has been recorded. The Trump administration has threatened to prosecute safe injection sites under federal law. But just as cities and states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, they could also pass laws authorizing these sites, preventing the local police from intervening. Federal law enforcement could then either turn a blind eye, as it’s largely done with marijuana, or bring states to court. People are dying at a staggering rate from overdoses — more in one year than the number of American soldiers who died during the entire Vietnam War. So some cities are already, rightly, taking the risk. Seattle and San Francisco are both on track to open sites, and Philadelphia recently approved the idea as well. Boston, Ithaca and New York City are considering their own facilities. At the first supervised site in North America, which opened in Vancouver in 2003, there was a 35 percent reduction in overdose deaths in the immediate vicinity, compared with a nine percent reduction in the rest of the city, according to a study published in The Lancet. And four separate studies have shown a positive association between using a safe injection site and starting addiction treatment. Neighbors and city officials sometimes challenge sites like these because they fear they will promote drug use and increase crime. Research instead suggests that they lead to increases in public order, with fewer discarded needles on the street and less drug use on the sidewalk, and have no impact on drug-related crimes. Such sites certainly don’t solve the problem of drug overdoses — Vancouver has had a recent spike in fentanyl-related overdose deaths, for instance. But they’re effective as part of a larger harm-reduction movement, which assumes that no matter how many well-intentioned programs exist to prevent people from starting or continuing to use drugs, there will always be people who shoot up. It’s better for everyone, the thinking goes, if they do that as safely as possible, with clean needles that are discarded properly. If the goal is to get drug users into treatment, the first step is to make sure they don’t die. So far, President Trump has advocated the opposite approach, focusing on law enforcement instead of harm reduction and promising to be “really, really tough” on people who deal drugs — an old idea that hasn’t worked to save lives. The administration’s 2019 budget plan proposed $13 billion over two years to address the opioid crisis, but it didn’t include much detail about what, exactly, that money would fund. In December, the attorney general’s office made its position on safe injection sites clear in response to a proposed facility in Vermont: “It is a crime, not only to use illicit narcotics, but to manage and maintain sites on which such drugs are used and distributed.” “In short, opiate addicts need treatment, not a place to continue using,” the office wrote. Advocates agree on the need for evidence-based treatment and services to help homeless drug users find housing or mental health care, but that’s not a reason to prosecute people trying to save lives at safe injection sites. There is at least one unauthorized, invitation-only site in the United States that a small nonprofit has been secretly running, in an unadvertised location, for more than three years. Staff members have been able to reverse all eight overdoses that have occurred on-site. Critics of such sites raise legitimate concerns about normalizing drug use that could be fatal. But so far, the wealth of available evidence shows two things: Most of America’s past policies have failed catastrophically, and the regions that have tried these sites have saved people. States and other cities should follow the lead of Seattle and Philadelphia to open safe injection sites. One of the most meaningful things the Trump administration could do to help drug users and their families is to stay out of the way.",5863

Mr. Dery coined the term “Afrofuturism” to describe the work of artists who used the tools of science fiction to imagine possible futures. The list of practitioners was relatively short at the time: It included black science fiction writers like Samuel Delany and Octavia Butler and the fantastical orchestra leader Sun Ra, who carried the name of the ancient Egyptian sun god and offered an allegory of salvation in which African-Americans were urged to escape tribulation by emigrating to the stars. The ranks of the Afrofuturist creators have grown considerably over the last 25 years. They expanded in dramatic fashion with the release of the wildly successful film “Black Panther,” the  first major superhero movie to feature a black director and writers and a majority black cast. The film’s most important distinction is that it is told from an Afrocentric point of view; it breaks with the spirit of derision that has always saturated Hollywood films about Africans. The movie takes its title from a 50-year-old Marvel comic superhero who might easily have passed out of existence had he not crossed paths with the African-American comic book writer Christopher Priest, who broke into this white industry during the 1980s and achieved influence in time to keep Marvel from hollowing out the character that has now become one of its most lucrative properties. “Black Panther” made his first appearance in a “Fantastic Four” comic in 1966, just as the traditional civil rights movement was giving way to black power. The comic has been inescapably identified with black radicalism, but it was clearly finished and ready for distribution before the now famous voting rights organizers in Lowndes County, Ala., adopted a snarling black panther as the ballot symbol for their new political party. And the issue reached stores months before Huey Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party in Oakland, Calif. — which originally was conceived of as a vehicle to protect black citizens from police brutality but evolved into a Marxist revolutionary group. The comic, as first introduced, was not the least bit radical in the political sense — and not even self-consciously black — but it had a genuinely radical subtext. The Black Panther’s alter ego was T’Challa, a highly educated king of the mythical African kingdom of Wakanda, which had never been colonized by foreign powers and was the most technologically sophisticated country in the world. (To underscore the country’s prowess, King T’Challa introduces himself to the Fantastic Four by giving them a vehicle that runs on magnetic levitation.) This portrait begs to be read as a critique of both the western slave trade and the prevailing attitudes of superiority through which Westerners have long viewed Africans. The public understandably conflated the comic book character with the radical political party that carried the same name. This association created ambivalence inside Marvel — which periodically tried to change the character’s name — and clearly played a role in keeping “Black Panther” a second-tier comic that often teetered on the verge of cancellation. Things stood thus in 1998 when Marvel, in the midst of financial meltdown, approached a brash African-American man named Christopher Priest with the prospect of revitalizing the withering “Black Panther” brand. Abraham Riesman wrote last month in Vulture that Mr. Priest was horrified by the offer because nobody read the comic, but he agreed to do it when the company insisted. Elsewhere, he spoke of being put off when colleagues suggested he make the character more “street.” Mr. Priest was known for a combustible temper, and he eventually stalked away from Marvel. But the resounding success of the new film, which draws heavily on his characterization, underscores the value of the contribution he made when he decided to treat T’Challa as more of a king than a superhero and gave him the internal life of a military and diplomatic strategist. The decision to immerse readers more deeply in Wakandan mythology also paid creative dividends. Other African-American writers have followed in Mr. Priest’s footsteps. The filmmaker Reginald Hudlin had a successful run at the helm.  Ta-Nehisi Coates, who is currently writing the series, has brought the books to a higher level of public notice. Nevertheless, the sinews of the film reflect the continuing influence of the pioneering man named Priest. This legacy bears out the argument Mr. Dery made a quarter century ago, when he observed that black artists could use the tools of futurism to change how the world sees itself.",4986

Such behavior by a mission in a precarious, troubled nation, where aid organizations may have the power of life and death over desperate populations, can only be called predatory. Oxfam International, the charity’s umbrella group, has ordered a broad range of actions to ensure that such behavior is not repeated, a move the group should have made years ago. The person in charge of that Haiti mission had been in charge of one in Chad 12 years ago when similar behavior occurred. The moral imperative is obvious, but for organizations that subsist largely on charitable donations, it is also existential. Oxfam’s donations have taken a serious tumble. The scandal has forced the entire humanitarian aid profession to undergo some deep soul-searching. The Guardian newspaper reported that senior officials who had worked at agencies around the globe told stories about colleagues using prostitutes or possibly exploiting vulnerable women, and about the reluctance of the organization to fully confront the problem despite warnings going back many years. Since the Oxfam scandal became public, the international aid group Doctors Without Borders has reported 24 cases of abuse or sexual harassment over the past year. There is no suggestion that humanitarian agencies have behaved anywhere near as foully as United Nations military peacekeepers, who have been accused for years of large-scale sexual abuse of populations they were sent to defend. Peacekeepers also brought cholera to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake there. But the Oxfam revelations have focused attention on the instinct of charities to keep quiet about episodes that might undermine their image, mission and morale. Oxfam learned of sexual abuse in Haiti in 2011 and fired those responsible, but never publicly explained why staff members were dismissed. The reason, explains Oxfam Great Britain’s current director, Mark Goldring, was to try to balance being transparent and protecting Oxfam’s work. That’s no excuse. Major humanitarian organizations have greatly expanded in recent decades and control millions in desperately needed aid when disaster strikes. The temptations for abuse in places where the imbalance of power is extreme and law and order has collapsed are huge, and, as Oxfam has said, they require “real and deep change in the way we handle accusations and cases of sexual harassment, exploitation and abuse.” Anyone who has witnessed the work done by this and other humanitarian agencies around the globe knows that the vast majority of their people work ardently and selflessly in some of the most daunting conditions imaginable. In many places, including Haiti, they are simply indispensable. But the Oxfam scandal has sounded an alarm across the entire nongovernmental aid profession that it must heed if it is to retain the public trust on which it depends. There must be zero tolerance for misuse of power by staff members in the field and swift and transparent action against any appearance of abuse.",3103

The recommendation, reported by The Washington Post, would afford Mr. Trump, who has often spoken about how he values the advice of his generals, a chance to reverse his earlier cruel decision against transgender enlistees and potential recruits. In the interest of fairness, justice and a military that represents American diversity, he should seize it. It was only a year after transgender Americans secured the right to defend their nation as equals in the military that Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets last July, summarily said he would banish them from serving. The president, who dodged the Vietnam War with five deferments, seemed to disparage the transgender enlistees as unsuited for battle by gratuitously asserting that the military “must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.” Since then, many have rallied to the defense of the transgender troops, including two senior Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, who is a former P.O.W., and Orrin Hatch of Utah, plus a group of 56 retired generals and admirals. Last fall, Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr. of the Marines, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that transgender troops have served with honor. “I believe any individual who meets the physical and mental standards and is worldwide deployable and is currently serving should be afforded the opportunity to continue to serve,” he said. Of course, none of that might matter in the end to Mr. Trump, whose crackdown against this minority group — there are only about 2,450 transgender troops among 1.3 million active-duty members of the military — has so far reflected obvious pandering to regressive generals and right-wing zealots, as well as knee-jerk opposition to many of the enlightened policies that his predecessor put in place. President Obama made gender identity a protected category in the Pentagon’s equal opportunity policy, ended the ban on gay recruits, opened all combat roles to women and named the first openly gay Army secretary. Mr. Trump claimed he reimposed the transgender ban “after consultation with my generals and military experts.” But General Dunford told the country’s top commanders that he was not consulted and that Mr. Trump’s decision to declare transgender people no longer welcome “in any capacity” was “unexpected,” according to emails reported this week by BuzzFeed News. The president, who has advocated treating transgender identity as a “disqualifying psychological and physical” condition, contrary to the views of scientific and human rights experts, has added immeasurably to the suffering of transgender people just yearning to be treated as human beings — including by being allowed to volunteer to serve their country, as only a small portion of Americans do. Top defense officials responded to Mr. Trump’s ban by slow-walking it. And after lawsuits were filed challenging the move, two federal judges late last year blocked it from taking effect, with one judge calling it most likely unconstitutional. Her decision, in October, not only halted a plan to discharge all transgender troops, it also allowed current transgender troops to re-enlist and permitted transgender recruits to join the military starting in January, a process the Pentagon has begun to implement. While these are positive signs, a lot of uncertainty remains, including what Mr. Mattis proposes to do with transgender recruits and whether Mr. Trump is capable of changing course on this issue. Now that Mr. Mattis’s recommendation has arrived at the White House, it will be up to Mr. Trump to make a final decision. It will be tragic if he clings to his prejudice, forcing transgender people out of the military and back into the shadows.",3999
5a8f64ec410cf7000162d766,2018-02-23T00:48:40+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/opinion/teachers-guns-classrooms.html,Editorial,"President Trump on Thursday repeated his call for “highly trained” schoolteachers to pack heat in their classrooms. If they were armed, the president said, they could fire back immediately at school shooters like the young man with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle who took 17 lives in Parkland, Fla. Beyond that, he tweeted, the knowledge that teachers have guns of their own would deter “the sicko” from heading to a school in the first place. With his usual fondness for capital letters, he added, “ATTACKS WOULD END!” Thus did Mr. Trump parrot a tired shibboleth repeated once again on Thursday by Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. “To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun,” Mr. LaPierre told a gathering of conservative activists. Actually, it’s hard to tell who was parroting whom. The president said much the same in a morning tweetstorm that said “a ‘gun free’ school is a magnet for bad people.” Let’s ask someone who’s in the trenches every day what he thinks of arming teachers. “It’s hard to begin to count the number of ways this is a bad idea,” said Chris Magnus, police chief of Tucson. For starters, the number of gunslinging educators would be huge. In the United States, there are about 3.5 million elementary and secondary school teachers in public and private institutions. Arming 20 percent of them, as Mr. Trump suggested, would mean 700,000 or so teachers with Glocks and the like on their hips — an armed force half as large as America’s real armed forces on active duty. One can envision parents with the means to do so swiftly yanking their children out of that sort of environment. More to the point, many deranged mass murderers expect to die themselves during their killing sprees. It’s almost laughable to believe that the president’s proposal would deter them. “Why would we think someone who has those kinds of problems is going to make rational decisions based on the fact that someone in the school might be armed?” Chief Magnus said. And then there’s this inescapable reality: Teachers are human. It means they would most likely react to stress-induced fear the same as anyone else, with unintended consequences that could put even more people in peril. You want people highly trained in the use of firearms? The New York Police Department has about 36,000 of them. Generally, despite an impression held by some people, they are restrained in firing their weapons. But in high-stress situations, they’re human, too. “Police officers miss a lot in combat situations,” said John Cerar, a former commanding officer of the department’s firearms and tactics section. Nationwide statistics on police shooting accuracy are not to be found. But if New York is typical, analyses show that its officers hit their targets only one-third of the time. And during gunfights, when the adrenaline is really pumping, that accuracy can drop to as low as 13 percent. While Mr. Cerar thinks armed teachers could provide some deterrence, he said that experience shows, “Whatever you do, there’s going to be a problem associated with it.” One problem is shooting bystanders. It isn’t routine, but it does happen. To cite just one example, from 2012, two New York officers shot and killed a gunman on a busy street outside the Empire State Building. But they also wounded nine other people who were hit directly or struck by shrapnel from ricochets. It takes little imagination to foresee a situation in which a frightened teacher, thrown into a combat situation — in a crowded space like a school hallway or classroom — wounds students in the process of trying to take out a gunman. The best way to prevent the threat of a bad guy with a gun is to keep him from getting the sort of battlefield weapon the Parkland killer used, by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and by tightening background checks. In his remarks, the mendacious Mr. LaPierre said gun restriction advocates seek to “eradicate all individual freedoms.” In fact, sensible gun laws would give people, especially children, a better chance to enjoy the first of the inalienable rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence: life.",4195

President Vladimir Putin has long believed that such interference is an effective way to assert the Kremlin’s might. And President Trump’s characteristically egocentric reaction, focusing exclusively on how it affects him, is likewise, sadly, in character. What may be most disconcerting in the entire affair is what it says about the state of democracy in the country that is supposed to be the model for the world. Whether the Russian web brigades actually affected the outcome of the presidential election, or any other, is impossible to tell. The fake news, false identities, cyberattacks and other tactics outlined in the Justice Department indictment last week seemed aimed at people who probably already got that sort of ranting from plenty of zany, homegrown sources. But therein lies the true danger: that the polarization in American politics, society and life has become so yawning that people on the far right, and to some degree on the left, are prepared to accept the most appalling and transparent lies to bolster their beliefs. As Amanda Taub and Max Fisher wrote in “The Interpreter” column in The Times on Sunday, “The false information and political advertisements that the Russians are accused of spreading could ring true only to those already predisposed to suspect the worst.” Not so many years ago, fake quotes like one in which Hillary Clinton praises Shariah law, or reports suggesting that Black Lives Matter activists are killing police officers, would have been dismissed as the rants of sick extremists. That they evidently find credence in at least a part of the population says far more about the state of public discourse than about Russia. We have become almost accustomed to Mr. Trump’s outrageous references to “Crooked Hillary” and all the other innumerable ways he constantly stokes partisan flames. Whether he knowingly colluded with the Russian web campaign is almost beside the point, since he is directly colluding with Russia’s efforts to discredit democracy when he treats the Kremlin’s brazen cybermeddling as a partisan issue and absurdly pins the blame on Barack Obama or Mrs. Clinton. It’s getting worse. Freedom House, an independent democracy watchdog, concluded in its annual report that “democracy faced its most serious crisis in decades in 2017 as its basic tenets — including guarantees of free and fair elections, the rights of minorities, freedom of the press and the rule of law — came under attack around the world.” The United States, it added, “retreated from its traditional role as both a champion and an exemplar of democracy amid an accelerating decline in American political rights and civil liberties.” Mr. Putin and his operatives no doubt take credit for this. Fear and suspicion of liberal democracy runs deep in Russia and in other countries slouching toward authoritarianism. They have a vested interest in making Western democracies appear as flawed, ugly and messy as possible. The Kremlin is not likely to abandon what looks to it like a winning strategy. But blaming Russia for America’s polarization makes as little sense as blaming Latin America for America’s opioid epidemic. We have created the market and the mess, and the Russian troll factory, however mendacious, should be seen not as a cause, but as a loud warning that democracy as we know it, as we have celebrated it for so long, is in peril.",3535

Instead, the country’s vicious president, Bashar al-Assad, and his enablers in Russia and Iran have exploited the battlefield successes against ISIS to unleash a new round of carnage on civilians, as the leaders of the United States and other world powers largely stand by, unwilling or unable to do anything to stop it. Shame on them all. The Assad-led bombardment of eastern Ghouta, a Damascus suburb of about 400,000 people and one of the last rebel-held areas, is being called one of the most violent episodes of the seven-year war. Since Sunday at least 310 people, many of them children, have been killed. That’s in addition to nearly 500,000 Syrians killed countrywide since 2011. Ghouta has been under siege for years, although it’s technically part of a negotiated de-escalation zone, leaving the district facing chronic shortages of food, medicine, medical personnel and other necessities. This week’s massive attack — which has involved rocket fire, shelling, airstrikes and helicopter-dropped barrel bombs that struck hospitals and other civilian infrastructure — intensified the misery. It seems intended to force rebels to surrender so the government can reclaim the territory. Most of the civilian casualties resulted from airstrikes on residential areas, the United Nations’ human rights office said. There have been signs that a government ground assault may soon follow. Photos posted on social media are excruciating. Terrified children, faces and bodies covered in blood. Shrouded corpses lined up on dirty concrete floors. Wounded patients on gurneys writhing in agony, lacking medical attention or even drugs to ease their pain. António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, called Ghouta a “hell on Earth.” If there was any doubt about the barbarity of the pro-Assad forces, it was dispelled by Brig. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan, leader of the government’s Tiger Force. “I promise, I will teach them a lesson, in combat and in fire,” he said in a video shared by pro-government social media accounts. “You won’t find a rescuer. And if you do, you will be rescued with water like boiling oil. You’ll be rescued with blood.” That’s the kind of evidence that must be used — sooner rather than later — to build a legal case to try Mr. Assad for war crimes. The same should be done for Russian leaders, who help keep Mr. Assad in power with political support and military air assets, and Iranian leaders, who provide tactical advice and ground troops. The United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, called what is going on in Ghouta a “monstrous campaign of annihilation” on Wednesday. The United States and other governments have even accused Mr. Assad of using chemical weapons — banned under international law — in Ghouta and elsewhere in Syria. But world powers have done nothing, beyond an American airstrike last April ordered by President Trump under questionable authority. Russia bears special responsibility because it guaranteed Mr. Assad would give up his chemical weapons as part of a 2013 deal with the United States, which the Syrian leader obviously did not do. The United Nations Security Council has been particularly impotent at ending the killing between Mr. Assad, a member of a Shiite sect, and the Syrian opposition, made up mostly of Sunnis. Some 11 Syria-related Security Council resolutions have failed to pass because of Russian vetoes. A new Swedish-Kuwaiti resolution, demanding a 30-day cease-fire in Syria so civilians can be resupplied or flee the war zone, seems destined for the same fate. Russia dismissed the resolution as “not realistic” — a reaction that highlights how protections for civilians in wartime, long a central tenet of international law, are being rapidly eroded. Complicating things even more, the civil war between Mr. Assad and the opposition, once seen as the core of Syria’s instability, is now understood as just one element in a web of conflicts tearing Syria apart. In addition to Russia and Iran, Turkey, the United States and Israel all have a presence in Syria, and their competing interests are raising the specter of wider war, which must be avoided. What of diplomatic solutions? Russia, after feigning to lead such an effort, lost credibility by siding with Mr. Assad and his route to more carnage. And while the State Department condemned the regime’s violence and named Russia as holding a “unique responsibility” for the suffering, Mr. Trump has effectively abandoned America’s international leadership role in the matter. This week, as reports of new Syrian casualties rolled in, aid groups and political leaders once again condemned, lamented and called for action. Unicef, the United Nations children’s agency, may have been more honest. Unable to muster more bromides, it issued a statement saying only, “No words will do justice to the children killed, their mothers, their fathers and their loved ones.”",5025

The latest move in that demolition derby came this week, when officials proposed giving insurance companies more leeway to sell junk health plans. The Department of Health and Human Services wants to let companies sell temporary health insurance policies that last up to 364 days, up from 90 days now. Officials say that would benefit people who are struggling with rising health insurance costs, because the plans tend to be cheaper than those on the insurance exchanges created by the A.C.A., or Obamacare. Not mentioned in the department’s talking points is the fact that these policies often do not cover things like mental health services, substance abuse treatment, cancer drugs and maternity care. As a result, people who buy such skimpy plans could end up being hit with exorbitant bills if they actually need medical care. The Obama administration limited these short-term plans to three months because they are meant to be a stopgap for people between jobs or in other temporary situations. The Trump administration would effectively encourage younger and healthier people to stop buying comprehensive policies on the Obamacare exchanges. As a result, insurers selling A.C.A. plans would be left covering an older and sicker population, forcing them to increase premiums. This would not be devastating to most of the people who use exchanges, because they receive federal subsidies that limit how much they have to pay. But it could really hurt middle-class families who earn too much to qualify for government assistance (about $82,000 for a family of three) and are already facing big premium increases. People in this group would have the terrible predicament of spending a lot of money buying health insurance or taking a chance by buying a skimpy temporary plan, hoping that nobody in the family gets sick or injured. This proposal is the latest in a series of steps the administration has taken to weaken the A.C.A. and the health care system. In January, it proposed allowing employers and sole proprietorships to form associations for the purpose of buying insurance policies that do not have to comply with the protections of the A.C.A. And it recently began allowing states like Kentucky to take Medicaid benefits away from people who are not employed, creating a system of red tape intended to hurt poor people who have lost their jobs or are unable to work. If the administration were actually serious about reducing health care costs, it would try to improve the A.C.A., not dismantle it. For example, President Trump could work with Congress to offer subsidies to middle-class families who do not qualify for help under Obamacare. Or he could push for the creation of a national reinsurance program that would encourage insurers to offer policies in more parts of the country at lower costs by protecting them against steep losses from very sick patients. But Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress seem unwilling to pursue constructive health care policies because they are obsessed with undoing Obamacare. Regrettably, the cost for their rage will be the health care of millions of low-income and middle-class families.",3328

We may be witness to such a moment now with the protests by American teenagers sickened — and terrified — by the latest mass murder at the hands of someone with easy access to a weapon fit for a battlefield, not a school. These kids have had enough. They’ve had enough of empty expressions of sympathy in the wake of the sort of atrocities they’ve grown up with, like last week’s mass shooting that took 17 lives at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Enough of the ritualistic mouthing of thoughts and prayers for the victims. Enough of living in fear that they could be next in the cross hairs of a well-armed deranged killer, even with all the active shooter drills and lockdowns they’ve gone through. Enough of craven politicians who kneel before the National Rifle Association and its cynically fundamentalist approach to the Second Amendment. They are asking in what kind of country are children sent off to school with bulletproof book bags strapped to their backs — capable, one manufacturer, Bullet Blocker, says, of “stopping a .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, 9mm, .45 caliber hollow point ammunition and more.” “I was born 13 months after Columbine,” a 12th grader named Faith Ward said on Monday, referring to the school massacre in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, the dawn of the modern wave of school shootings. Ms. Ward spoke to a television reporter at an anti-gun demonstration outside her school in Plantation, Fla. “This is all I have ever known,” she said, “this culture of being gunned down for no reason, and this culture of people saying, ‘Oh, let’s send thoughts and prayers’ for three days, and then moving on. And I’m tired of it.” So are we all. It is too soon to tell if this righteous anger augurs a sustained youth movement for gun sanity, going beyond the occasional protest. We hope it does. It’s time, once again, for America to listen to its children. Who among us have more at stake than they? Sensible young people have it in their power to make their senseless elders take heed — and act. We saw it happen during the Vietnam War half a century ago. Young people, initially reviled by establishment forces as unwashed, longhaired traitors, energized an antiwar movement that swept the country and, even if it took years, ultimately ended America’s misguided adventure in Southeast Asia. To be effective, any movement needs a realistic program, not mere emotion. Otherwise, it risks coming and going in a flash with little to show for itself. A tighter federal system of background checks is a start, to better monitor would-be gun buyers with mental illness, for example, or histories of gun violence. Such a program should also include reinstating a nationwide ban on assault weapons — a state measure died in the Florida Legislature Tuesday — and ending an absurd prohibition against using federal public health funds to study gun violence. Even President Trump, who told an N.R.A. convention last April that “you have a true friend and champion in the White House,” has signaled he might be willing to improve the system. The Washington Post reported that after Mr. Trump saw the coverage of the student protesters, he asked Mar-a-Lago guests whether he should do more about gun control. On Tuesday, he ordered that regulations be written to ban bump stocks, devices that can make an automatic weapon out of a semiautomatic. Beyond that, though, it’s hard to tell if he means business when he says he’s open to more thorough background checks. Steadfastness is not a Trump hallmark. However, if young people channeling this angry moment remain steadfast, they might not only force his hand but also stiffen the resolve of other elected officials and candidates. Horrific school shootings aside, they are vulnerable every day to gun mayhem at a stomach-churning rate. The journal Pediatrics reported last June that gunfire, each week, kills an average of 25 children ages 17 and under. A 2016 study in The American Journal of Medicine calculated that among two dozen of the world’s wealthiest nations, this country alone accounted for 91 percent of firearms deaths among children 14 and under. What the young protesters are saying now is: Put down the guns. We’re your children. How can anyone not heed their pained voices?",4476

The commission also threatened to shut the complex itself if Mayor Bill de Blasio fails to move expeditiously. The report was clearly a response to what state officials see as a lack of urgency on the city’s part. But if the state truly wants to expedite this closing, it needs to do all it can to make it easier for New York City to transfer inmates to newer, smaller jails built elsewhere in the city that would be safer for both inmates and guards. Beyond that, city and state officials need to move away from the counterproductive language of mutual recrimination that will hinder this effort. The barbaric nature of life at Rikers Island came into horrifying focus four years ago, when Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, issued a report documenting a “culture of violence” at the complex, where teenagers in particular were battered and beaten by guards who acted with impunity, without any fear of punishment by city officials. In 2015, the city ended a long-running legal battle over the conditions at Rikers, signing a court-enforceable agreement that called for sweeping changes there. The city subsequently decided to cut its losses and close the facility, which is too large and poorly designed to be safely used as a jail. The new report from the New York State Commission of Correction said that Rikers was one of the worst jails in the state, with more violent incidents, sex offenses and disturbances than could be explained by its size, and that violent incidents actually increased between 2016 and 2017. Most tellingly, the report said that the city’s Department of Correction has been unwilling and unable to take the needed remedial steps. In a clear slap at the de Blasio administration, the commission accused the city of dragging its feet on the 10-year proposal, saying that, even if the city had been moving expeditiously, a decade was too long to tolerate a “spiraling year to year increase of violent incidents and degrading conditions facing both inmates and staff.” The governor’s office released the report just hours before Mr. de Blasio held a news conference to announce plans to build a new jail in the Bronx and to renovate three other facilities elsewhere in the city as part of a strategy to empty Rikers. The Cuomo administration slammed the city for adopting the 10-year plan in the first place and called the building announcement the de Blasio administration’s “first positive step” toward closing the complex. The city argues that the timeline could be shortened by years if the Legislature expedited changes that would make the process easier. These include: changes that would speed up construction and legislation that would ensure speedier trials, reform the bail system and allow the city to give inmates who showed good behavior the opportunity for earlier release. The city also would be helped if state parole violators were held in state prisons — as opposed to mainly in local jails — and if the state adopted a system of graduated sanctions and rewards, instead of automatically consigning parolees to jail for minor rule-breaking. The governor and legislative leaders who want to see Rikers closed quickly need to put their energies behind these proposals.",3516
5a8b7863410cf7000162ccf8,2018-02-20T01:22:34+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/opinion/republican-environment-policy.html,Editorial,"Here’s a warning to the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and other environmentally inclined Senate Democrats, like Sheldon Whitehouse and Ed Markey: A legislative minefield lies dead ahead, pocked with destructive amendments of Republican origin hostile to clean air, clean water, endangered species and fragile landscapes. And here’s a plea: Stop these measures from becoming law. Following its approval of the big budget deal on Feb. 9, Congress began writing the dozen appropriations bills that direct federal dollars to specific agencies. These bills are likely to be incorporated in one giant omnibus spending measure to be negotiated over the next few weeks by House and Senate leaders in advance of the March 23 expiration of the continuing budget resolution that has kept the government going. Given its urgency, the bill is fertile ground for the kind of mischief the Republicans in particular have been notorious for over the years — loading up must-pass bills like this one with provisions, known as riders, that in most cases could not survive on their own and thus need protective cover. In years past, such riders were usually inserted at the last minute on the House or Senate floor. Here they are in plain sight, having been approved in earlier votes or endorsed by powerful committee chairmen or chairwomen who will do their level best to make sure they are included in the final bill. Mr. Schumer can prevent that from happening. The Democrats are effectively 49 in number, the Republicans 51. By holding his party together, he can deny the Republicans the 60 votes they need to overcome a filibuster — ensuring a clean bill, and a cleaner environment. Public interest groups have counted nearly 90 of these riders, but here are several of the worst: Clean water In 2015, the Obama administration adopted a landmark rule intended to clarify and broaden protections for smaller streams and wetlands vital to the country’s drinking water and wildlife. Although the bill simply reaffirmed the reach of the original 1972 Clean Water Act, developers and big farmers complained to Scott Pruitt, the industry-friendly head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has begun the lengthy process of replacing the rule with something more favorable to commercial interests. That’s not fast enough for the leaders of three separate appropriations panels — in the House, the interior and environment subcommittee and the energy and water development subcommittee; and in the Senate, the interior and environment subcommittee — who are pushing nearly identical riders that would kill the rule right away, without consulting the public or conducting the scientific analysis required by law. Methane emissions As part of its larger strategy to combat climate change, the Obama administration approved two rules to minimize emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The E.P.A. would regulate emissions from new oil and gas wells; the Interior Department would require oil and gas companies to control venting and flaring from existing wells on public lands. Efforts to delay (and ultimately rewrite) both rules have been thwarted by the courts. Here again, Congress comes to the rescue with two riders (both approved in earlier House floor votes) that would kill both rules, at great cost to the climate and to clean air. Sage grouse Of a handful of riders aimed at removing safeguards for endangered species, the most infuriating are roughly identical riders in the House and the Senate that would deny endangered species protections to a Western bird called the sage grouse, whose numbers are declining. The Obama administration worked long and hard with various stakeholders — state governments, ranchers, even the oil and gas companies — to give the bird a chance, and keep it off the endangered species list, by banning commercial activities on hundreds of thousands of acres of prime sage grouse habitat; it was a remarkable achievement in the annals of conservation. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke thinks the plan is much too nice to the bird and much too mean to the oil and gas companies, and he wants to roll it back. If he does, the bird’s last line of defense would be the Endangered Species Act, whose protections would, under this rider, no longer be available to it. Alaska wild lands Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska and chairwoman of the Senate interior and environment appropriations subcommittee, managed to sneak a hugely controversial amendment into last year’s big tax bill opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling. Her amendment would never have passed as a stand-alone measure. Now she wants more. One amendment she seeks would weaken protections against the clear-cutting of old growth trees in the Tongass National Forest. Another would exempt forests throughout Alaska from one of the most significant forest conservation measures of the last century, the Clinton-era “roadless rule” forbidding road building and, by extension, logging, mining and other commercial activity on roughly 50 million acres of wild national forests. The idea was to preserve undeveloped public lands and protect water supplies, wildlife and other natural values. Mr. Schumer should draw a firm line against both her amendments. Anything President Barack Obama did to preserve natural resources is fair game for this administration, as well as among the administration’s allies in Congress. In the wheeling and dealing now underway, Mr. Schumer and his fellow Democrats cannot bargain away the environment.",5552

The argument that Baltimore might be able to remake its grotesquely corrupt Police Department without federal help was blown apart last Monday, when a federal jury convicted two detectives of robbery and racketeering charges in a trial that has exposed pervasive corruption in the department. The city’s elite Gun Trace Task Force has been gripped by a conspiracy in which officers covered for one another as they stole property, narcotics and money from people, some of whom had committed no crimes and had earned the money lawfully. In addition, the officers filed false reports that allowed some to pilfer vast amounts of overtime, doubling their salaries, and those who were convicted testified to seizing weapons that were subsequently sold on the street — a cardinal outrage in a city wracked by gun violence. Monday’s convictions follow guilty pleas by six other officers in connection with the case, and as The Baltimore Sun reported last week, the officers and other witnesses have now implicated a dozen additional colleagues, so more charges could be in the offing. What makes the guilty officers’ conduct particularly brazen is that much of it occurred during a separate federal investigation into police practices, an inquiry begun in the wake of the protests and rioting that followed the death of Freddie Gray, a young African-American man who died of a broken spine suffered in police custody in 2015. That investigation revealed an abusive form of policing, vindicating black Baltimoreans who had complained for years that they were being stopped, frisked and even arrested without cause. These practices destroyed public confidence in law enforcement, paving the way for the fiery outrage that followed Mr. Gray’s death. Congress had cases like this one in mind in 1994 when it gave the Justice Department the authority to restructure troubled police departments that were clearly unable of root out corruption and brutality on their own. Using this authority, the Obama Justice Department negotiated a sweeping agreement that requires Baltimore to undertake a wide range of reforms, including better training and technology, community oversight and transparency measures. A federal judge last year rejected the Trump Justice Department’s attempt to delay court approval of the agreement, known as a consent decree, which the city’s civic leaders say is absolutely essential to overhauling a police department that has a longstanding reputation for abusing the people it is meant to protect — and that has failed, at every level, to contain lawlessness in the ranks that should have been visible to everyone in charge. The monitor who was appointed by the court to determine if and when Baltimore has fulfilled the terms of the consent decree needs to keep those failures foremost in mind.",3131

Where to begin? Trump officials have been accused of wasting taxpayer dollars when they travel for work — or, in the case of one cabinet secretary, when they travel for a work trip-cum-European vacation. Others have appeared to misuse their positions to benefit special interests and political allies. Then there are those who have conscripted family members to help them do their jobs, possibly under the mistaken belief that it takes a village of people with the same last name to run a government department. Perhaps we should not be surprised by these ethical lapses, given that the president himself has little interest in ethical niceties. He has refused to disclose his tax returns or divest businesses that may create conflicts of interest between Mr. Trump the executive and Mr. Trump the president. And he has given his daughter and son-in-law, who have no government experience, plum White House jobs. Here are some of the recent scandals in Trumpland that deserve greater public scrutiny, or even congressional hearings and investigations. MR. FIRST CLASS  Scott Pruitt, the champion of fossil fuel interests who is busily trying to destroy the Environmental Protection Agency, and his aides have made the ludicrous argument in recent days that he must fly first class because he is not safe in economy. This has elicited howls of laughter from aviation experts. Mr. Pruitt and his staff have racked up a tab totaling many thousands of dollars for domestic and international trips, including $1,641 for a brief flight from Washington to New York. Mr. Pruitt told The New Hampshire Union Leader that he has to travel in the front of the cabin because people in coach are mean to him. “We’ve reached the point where there’s not much civility in the marketplace, and it’s created, you know, it’s created some issues,” he said. EUROPEAN IDYLL In other travel news, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, last week struggled to explain why the government spent $4,000 to fly his wife to Europe so she could accompany him for what was supposed to be a trip to attend a conference on veterans’ issues. Turns out, the happy couple spent nearly half the trip checking out sites like Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen and Buckingham Palace in London. Oh, and they also improperly accepted free tickets to watch a tennis match at Wimbledon, according to the V.A.’s inspector general. Dr. Shulkin said he was repaying the Treasury for the cost of his wife’s ticket, though not before producing an unusual 28-page rebuttal to the inspector general’s report. FAVORITISM AT THE F.C.C. At the Federal Communications Commission, Chairman Ajit Pai is under fire from Democrats in Congress for relaxing rules that restrict how many local TV stations a business can own in one market, weeks before a large conservative broadcaster, Sinclair, announced it was acquiring more stations by buying Tribune Media. The commission denies any wrongdoing, but has refused to respond to members of Congress who have sought information about Mr. Pai’s contacts with Sinclair executives. The Times reported in August that the chairman and his staff met and corresponded with Sinclair several times. Earlier, The New York Post reported that Mr. Trump had met with Sinclair officials and discussed the F.C.C. rules. Clearly, there is nothing to see here. FAMILIAL SUPPORT It is hard to get good help when unemployment is at 4.1 percent. Perhaps that’s why Ben Carson, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, saw fit to let his son, Ben Carson Jr., organize a “listening tour” for the secretary in Baltimore, despite warnings from department lawyers that doing so could violate ethics rules. One lawyer wrote in a memo that the son’s involvement could give “the appearance that the secretary may be using his position for his son’s private gain” because his son and his son’s wife might be doing or seeking business with people invited to attend events on the tour, according to The Washington Post. Mr. Carson says that he and his family did nothing wrong and that they were “under attack by the media.” This is hardly a complete list. We haven’t even gotten to the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, his wife, Louise Linton, and their penchant for traveling on military planes when far cheaper options are available. And there are Trump appointees like Tom Price, the former health and human services secretary, and Brenda Fitzgerald, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who have had to bail out of the administration because of scrutiny they were under for expensive air travel (Mr. Price) and dubious investments (Dr. Fitzgerald). During the election, Mr. Trump said he would stock his administration with “the best people in the world.” That is working out about as well as his promise to turn Trump University students into successful real estate investors.",5180

Red and blue states were putting in place smart, sensible reforms like reducing harsh sentencing laws, slashing prison populations and crime rates, and providing more resources for the thousands of people who are released every week. President Obama’s record on the issue was far from perfect, but he and his first attorney general, Eric Holder Jr., took several key steps: weakening racially discriminatory sentencing laws, shortening thousands of absurdly long drug sentences, and pulling back on the prosecution of low-level drug offenders and of federal marijuana offenses in states that have legalized it. This approach reflected state-level efforts and sent a message of encouragement to those still leery of reform. Within minutes of taking office, Mr. Trump turned back the dial, warning darkly in his Inaugural Address of “American carnage,” of cities and towns gutted by crime — even though crime rates are at their lowest in decades. Things only got worse with the confirmation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who, along with Mr. Trump, appears to be stuck in the 1980s, when politicians exploited the public’s fear of rising crime to sell absurdly harsh laws and win themselves re-election. Perhaps that’s why both men seem happy to distort, if not outright lie about, crime statistics that no longer support their narrative. Last February, Mr. Trump claimed that “the murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years.” Wrong: The national rate remains at an all-time low. It’s true that the 10.8 percent increase in murders between 2014 and 2015 was the largest one-year rise in more than four decades, but the total number of murders is still far below what it was in the early 1990s. For his part, Mr. Sessions has repeatedly hawked a nationwide crime wave that doesn’t exist, and he has called crime spikes in certain areas a “dangerous, permanent trend that places the health and safety of the American people at risk” — despite the lack of any evidence that recent upticks will last. To the contrary, in 2017 the crime rate in the nation’s 30 biggest cities actually went down. As bad as the dishonesty is the fact that Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions have managed to engineer their backward worldview largely under the public’s radar, as a new report from the Brennan Center for Justice documents. Last May, Mr. Sessions ordered federal prosecutors to charge as aggressively as possible in every case — reversing a policy of Mr. Holder’s that had eased up on nonviolent drug offenders and others who fill the nation’s federal prisons. In January, Mr. Sessions rescinded another Obama-era policy that discouraged federal marijuana prosecutions in states where its sale and use are legal. (Mr. Sessions has long insisted, contrary to all available evidence, that marijuana is “a dangerous drug” and “only slightly less awful” than heroin.) These sorts of moves don’t get much attention, but as the report notes, they could end up increasing the federal prison population, which began to fall for the first time in decades under Mr. Obama. The reversal of sensible criminal justice reform doesn’t stop there. Under Mr. Trump, the Justice Department has pulled back from his predecessor’s investigations of police abuse and misconduct; resumed the use of private, for-profit prisons; and stopped granting commutations to low-level drug offenders who have spent years or decades behind bars. Meanwhile, Mr. Sessions, who as a senator was one of the most reliable roadblocks to long-overdue federal sentencing reform, is still throwing wrenches into the works as Congress inches toward a bipartisan deal. Mr. Sessions called the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, a sweeping bill that would reduce some mandatory-minimum sentences, and that cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, a “grave error.” That earned him a rebuke from the committee’s chairman, Senator Charles Grassley, who pointed out that the attorney general is tasked with enforcing the laws, not writing them. “If General Sessions wanted to be involved in marking up this legislation, maybe he should have quit his job and run for the Republican Senate seat in Alabama,” Mr. Grassley said. Mr. Grassley is no one’s idea of a justice reformer, but he supports the bill because, he said, it “strikes the right balance of improving public safety and ensuring fairness in the criminal justice system.” So what has this administration done right? The list is short and uninspiring. In October, Mr. Trump declared the epidemic of opioid abuse a national emergency, which could be a good step toward addressing it — but he’s since done almost nothing to combat a crisis that killed more than 64,000 Americans in 2016. In his State of the Union address last month, Mr. Trump promised to “embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.” It’s great if he really means that, but it’s hard to square his assurance with his own attorney general’s opposition to a bill that includes recidivism-reduction programs intended to achieve precisely this goal. Perhaps the most insidious part of the Trump administration’s approach to criminal justice lies in its efforts to link crime to its broader crackdown on immigration. In a speech last month, Mr. Sessions said undocumented immigrants are far more likely than American citizens to commit crimes, a claim he found in a paper by John Lott, the disreputable economist best known for misusing statistics to suit his own ideological ends. In this case, it appears Mr. Lott misread his own data, which came from Arizona and in fact showed the opposite of what he claimed: Undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than citizens, as the vast majority of research on the topic has found. But no matter; Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions don’t need facts to run their anti-immigrant agenda, which has already resulted in more than double the number of arrests of immigrants with no criminal convictions as in 2016, as the Brennan Center report noted. Soon after taking office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order cutting off federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials. A federal judge blocked the order in November for violating the Constitution. The rhetoric from the White House and the Justice Department has emboldened some state and local officials to talk tougher, even if just as ignorantly, about crime. The good news is that it’s not working as well anymore. In Virginia’s race for governor last fall, the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, attacked his opponent, Ralph Northam, with ads blaming him for violence by the MS-13 gang. It was a despicable stunt, its fearmongering recalling the racist but effective Willie Horton ad that George H. W. Bush ran on in his successful 1988 presidential campaign. Thankfully, Virginia’s voters overwhelmingly rejected Mr. Gillespie, another sign that criminal justice reform is an issue with strong support across the political spectrum. In the era of Donald Trump, candidates of both parties should be proud to run as reformers — but particularly Democrats, who can cast the issue not only as a central component of a broader progressive agenda, but as yet another example of just how out of touch with the country Mr. Trump and his administration are.",7620

For the past year, Donald Trump has repeatedly denied the existence of a profound national security threat: Russia’s attempt to interfere in the 2016 election on his behalf. He dismissed the Russian subversion effort as a hoax by his opponents and the media despite voluminous evidence to the contrary — including the consensus of the American intelligence community — that it did in fact happen, and is sure to happen again. Now come the indictments. On Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia’s role in the 2016 election, filed criminal charges of fraud and identity theft against 13 Russian citizens and three Russian organizations, all alleged to have operated a sophisticated influence campaign intended to “sow discord in the U.S. political system.” One organization, the Internet Research Agency — which the indictment says is funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the “go-to oligarch” of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin — began its efforts as early as 2014, according to the indictment. Its staffers, known as “specialists,” posed as Americans and created false identities to set up social media pages and groups aimed at attracting American audiences. The broad outlines of this interference have been known publicly for a while, but the sheer scope of the deception detailed in Friday’s indictments is breathtaking. By the spring of 2016, the operation had zeroed in on supporting Mr. Trump and disparaging Hillary Clinton. The Internet Research Agency alone had a staff of 80 and a monthly budget of $1.25 million. On the advice of a real, unnamed grass-roots activist from Texas, it had focused its efforts on swing states like Colorado, Virginia and Florida. Staffers bought ads with messages like “Hillary is a Satan,” “Ohio Wants Hillary 4 Prison” and “Vote Republican, Vote Trump, and support the Second Amendment!” They created hundreds of social media accounts on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other sites to confuse and anger people about sensitive issues like immigration, religion and the Black Lives Matter movement — in some cases gaining hundreds of thousands of followers. They staged rallies while pretending to be American grass-roots organizations. A poster at one “pro-Clinton” rally in July 2016 read “Support Hillary. Save American Muslims,” along with a fabricated quote attributed to Mrs. Clinton: “I think Sharia Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.” As the election drew nearer, they tried to suppress minority turnout and promoted false allegations of Democratic voter fraud. The specialist running one of the organization’s Facebook accounts, called “Secured Borders,” was criticized for not publishing enough posts and was told that “it is imperative to intensify criticizing Hillary Clinton.” After the election, they continued to spread confusion and chaos, staging rallies both for and against Mr. Trump, in one case on the same day and in the same city. All along, they took steps to cover their tracks by stealing the identities of real Americans, opening accounts on American-based servers and lying about what their money was being used for. Last September, after Facebook turned over information about Russian ad purchases to the special counsel, a specialist named Irina Kaverzina emailed a family member: “We had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke). So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues.” Ms. Kaverzina continued, “I created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.” Fake news, indeed. Mr. Trump’s defenders, desperate to exculpate him, seized on a single word — “unwitting” — that the indictment used to describe certain “members, volunteers and supporters of the Trump campaign involved in local community outreach” who had interacted with the Russians. In other words, as the White House subtly put it in a statement on Friday, “NO COLLUSION.” The president repeated the claim himself in a tweet, grudgingly acknowledging Russia’s “anti-US campaign,” but emphasizing that it had started “long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong — no collusion!” It’s true that, as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in an announcement, these particular indictments do not allege that any American knew about the influence campaign, nor that the campaign had changed the outcome of the election. But that’s quite different from saying that there was no collusion or impact on the election. As Mr. Rosenstein also said, the special counsel’s investigation is continuing, and there are many strands the public still knows little or nothing about. Remember, Mr. Mueller has already secured two guilty pleas, one from Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser and another from a former campaign adviser, for lying to federal authorities about their connections to Russian government officials. He has also charged Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his top aide, Rick Gates, with crimes including money laundering. Mr. Gates appears to be nearing a plea deal himself. Then there were Russian cyberattacks on the elections systems of at least 39 states. And the hacking of emails sent among members of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign — which Mr. Trump openly encouraged. This is all going to happen again. Intelligence and law enforcement authorities have made that clear. The question is whether Mr. Trump will at last accept the fact of Russian interference and take aggressive measures to protect American democracy. For starters, he could impose the sanctions on Russia that Congress overwhelmingly passed, and that he signed into law, last summer. Of course, this would require him to overcome his mysterious resistance to acting against Russia and to focus on protecting his own country.",6013

The terror that has gripped their elected officials, however, is fear of the wealthy gun lobby, to which they have let themselves be held hostage for decades. But standing up to gun rights extremists and industry lobbyists can no longer be seen as an act of heroism that could lead to political suicide. It is an act of common sense that would bring our government under the control of its citizens. Hundreds have been killed in mass shootings at a high school in Littleton, Colo., a church in Charleston, S.C., an office party in San Bernardino, Calif., a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., and elsewhere in the past 20 years. After 20 first graders and a half-dozen adults were slaughtered in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, it seemed that a line would be drawn in the sand. Enough was enough, people said. But nothing was done. People have been injured or killed in eight school shootings in the first seven weeks of 2018 alone. Though many Americans, and some elected officials, have taken a stand to stanch the epidemic of gun violence, the National Rifle Association and its congressional servants have been an unyielding obstacle to sensible reform. But the gun lobby’s stranglehold on our elected officials does not need to continue, if candidates stand up to the lobby and voters demand that they commit themselves to the sorts of changes that a vast majority of Americans want. With midterm elections coming up this fall, America has a chance to get that message across. Candidates must realize that reducing gun violence is a winning and moral issue. Aggressive turnout by voters who believe this can defeat the N.R.A. at the polls. Until then, the bloodshed will continue.",1936

Alas, they both fell before the anti-immigration furor of the Trump administration. But then President Trump’s own hard-line immigration bill fell much harder, leaving the fate of the so-called Dreamers in limbo. The compromise measures would have resolved the fate of the Dreamers, the 1.8 million immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children and whose plight has generated broad sympathy. One bill written by a bipartisan group of senators calling itself the Common Sense Coalition would also have given Mr. Trump money for his much-ballyhooed wall along the Mexican border, though over a 10-year period, while putting off more contentious questions about immigration. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump is not interested in resolving a difficult problem if he can exploit it for political gain. After threatening to veto any measure that didn’t include his tough demands, and getting Department of Homeland Security officials to bad-mouth the compromise measures, the president succeeded in getting most Republicans to vote against them, leaving both short of the 60 votes they needed, one by eight votes and one by six. Minutes later, the Senate even more decisively beat the White House’s own proposal, which would have provided a path to citizenship for the Dreamers while also severely limiting family-based immigration and ending the diversity visa lottery program. The bill fell 21 votes short of the needed 60. It is not clear what lies ahead for the Dreamers or for the congressional effort to find a solution. It’s hard to imagine that this legislative stalemate concerns the president much. Given the passions around immigration and rising tensions over midterm elections, he and conservative Republicans might be just as happy to beat their chests about Democratic obstruction to immigration reform. They could also try to blame the Democrats for the Dreamers’ loss, even though it was Mr. Trump who ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which gave the Dreamers temporary protection from deportation. Even though a moderate compromise would be a Band-Aid solution, as Mr. Trump said, leaving fundamental questions unresolved, it is about the best that can be achieved given the yawning divide over immigration. The president himself at one point expressed sympathy for the young immigrants and said he might make a deal with Democrats to protect them. At another point he said he would sign any immigration bill put on his desk. As Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, noted, most Americans would applaud a deal that takes care of the Dreamers, enhances border security and lets Mr. Trump claim victory for his wall. Now that the senators have witnessed a decisive bipartisan rejection of Mr. Trump’s get-tough approach, they might see their way to reconsider a more modest measure that takes the Dreamers out of limbo and enhances security. A deal, in other words, that actually does something about the system beyond cruelly using immigrants as pawns in political games and forever blaming the other side.",3345

The Trump administration wants to cut the budget of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, popularly known as food stamps, by nearly 30 percent over a decade. It plans to accomplish this, in large part, by giving low-income families boxes of pasta, cereal and other nonperishable foods, rather than giving them the full amount of their benefit on electronic cards, as the SNAP program works today. Those cards can be used at about 260,000 retail stores and farmers’ markets nationwide to buy a wide range of fresh and packaged food, allowing recipients to shop with their families’ preferences and dietary needs in mind. The administration argues that its proposal, which also would make it harder for adults living without children or other dependents to benefit from the program if they aren’t employed, is “designed to improve nutrition and target benefits to those who need them, while ensuring careful stewardship of taxpayers’ money.” If Mr. Trump and his aides actually cared about improving nutrition and the lives of low-income Americans, they would be trying to put more money into SNAP, not less. The program has done a heroic job of reducing poverty and improving the lives of millions of people. Studies have found that the program’s beneficiaries are less likely to report not having enough to eat. They are also less likely to take sick days and are shown to spend less on health care compared with similar people who do not benefit from the program. Further, children who grow up in families enrolled in SNAP are more likely to graduate from high school and be economically self-sufficient as adults. Right-wing ideologues in the Trump administration seem to consider SNAP a wasteful welfare program that needs to be brought to heel. In reality, the program is a relative bargain that provides fairly modest benefits to some of the poorest people in the country. The government spent about $70 billion on SNAP in 2017, less than 2 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget. The average beneficiary gets $126 a month. The people who are helped by the program tend to have very low incomes, are retired or have disabilities. A family of three generally has to earn less than $26,600 a year to qualify. Anybody who has spent time in grocery stores or at farmers’ markets knows that $126 does not go a long way, and advocates for low-income families note that many people run out of their benefits before the month is out. It is no surprise, then, that one study published in the journal Health Affairs in 2014 found that the risk of hospital admissions for low blood sugar levels among low-income people in California jumped sharply in the last week of the month, compared with the first week. There was no comparable spike among high-income people. Conversely, experts have found that increasing the value of food stamps and making them available to more people can do good things. When Congress temporarily bolstered the program as a part of the 2009 economic stimulus bill, low-income people bought more food and were less likely to report not having enough to eat, according to a report by the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Trump’s proposal for slashing SNAP and introducing food boxes comes just as Congress is working on a new Farm Bill, which lawmakers have to pass before the end of September, when authorizations for food stamps and other agricultural programs are scheduled to end. Several Republican lawmakers have said they are unlikely to get on board with the administration’s retrograde ideas. That’s good. But given how far members of Congress have gone to do Mr. Trump’s bidding in the last year, it won’t be a complete relief until lawmakers vote to keep the program going without cuts.",4012

If put to canvas, his State of the City speech setting forth an agenda for his second term might well be colored in 50 shades of charcoal gray. He spoke about “the decline of democracy,” about a country at risk of becoming “a pseudo-democracy,” about how “we are so far from what the norm should be of an active and inclusive democracy,” about how “I have never felt our democracy as imperiled as I do today.” The grim litany was almost enough to make one reach for the bottle. We’re in sync with him on the perils of social and economic inequality and on the need for vigilance in the face of this White House’s routine flouting of democratic norms. But it’s hard to escape the sense that Mr. de Blasio is an imperfect messenger for some of the reforms he advocated to “redemocratize a society that is losing its way.” His call for broader public financing of local elections and “getting big money out of politics” sounded good. But it might have resonated more had it come from someone who did not rely on big money in his campaigns, and was criticized by federal prosecutors for blurring pay-to-play ethics — and has no doubt run his last race for local office. The mayor pledged to create a commission to revise City Charter provisions on campaign financing. Every New York mayor in the last quarter-century has favored this sort of panel to achieve a specific goal, usually stocking it with loyalists. Why bother with a process that may well run a tortuous course? Nothing stops Mr. de Blasio from immediately drafting legislation to get the same result, and persuading the City Council to pass it. Like his sparring partner, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the mayor urged that the state free itself from stifling election procedures, in particular constraints that make it one of only 13 states without early voting. It remains unclear if the State Legislature, notably the Republican-controlled Senate, will go along with the idea. But Mr. Cuomo at least gave it a helpful lift this week when he heeded a call here to show he means business by adding necessary money — $7 million in his proposed budget — to make early voting happen. Mr. de Blasio also said he wanted to register 1.5 million city voters over the next four years. Roughly 4.6 million are on the rolls now. Sounds like a plan. Only it’s unclear how expanding the electorate will solve what he called “the problem of shrinking voter participation.” Turnout in the city is abysmal. It was less than 25 percent in November’s general election and 14 percent in the September primaries. A dearth of engaging races has led to widespread apathy. A strong system of public financing might encourage more candidates, hopefully well qualified, to run. Absent that, increasing the voter rolls may simply mean listing more people who stay home on Election Day. To deal with this issue, the mayor said he would appoint a “chief democracy officer.” Who knew that democracy needed an officer in charge of it, let alone a chief?",3074

No one knows more about the threats to the United States than these six officials, so when they all agree, it would be derelict to ignore their concerns. Yet President Trump continues to refuse to even acknowledge the malevolent Russian role. It’s particularly striking that four of the men who gave this warning to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday — the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo; the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats; the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray; and the Defense Intelligence Agency director, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley — were all appointed by Mr. Trump. They testified that the president has never asked them to take measures to combat Russian interference and protect democratic processes. Mr. Trump isn’t completely oblivious about Russia, of course. He fired Mr. Wray’s predecessor, James Comey, to derail the F.B.I.’s investigation of possible Trump campaign involvement with the election hacking, and reportedly asked Mr. Coats and Mr. Pompeo to help end the investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Mr. Flynn’s contacts with Russians. With the midterm elections only nine months away, the federal government is taking some defensive measures. It is trying to get at least one election official in each state a security clearance to make them aware of threats, and is providing states with enhanced online security to ensure that Americans’ votes will not be manipulated. Nevertheless, absent Mr. Trump’s commitment, there can be no robust mobilization to take all measures needed to confront an insidious problem that strikes at the heart of the democratic system. These would include a comprehensive and well-funded plan for protecting critical infrastructure, countering cyberattacks and mitigating propaganda. The president should not only be strengthening electoral defenses, but also pushing back against Russia, instead of ignoring a law Congress adopted overwhelmingly to impose sanctions for election meddling and aggression against Ukraine. The list of potential activities meriting sanctions covers weapons deals, human rights abuses and Russian cyberattacks against the United States and other democracies. Although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assured Congress on Wednesday that sanctions “are coming,” there’s little reason to believe him. The State Department recently argued that it didn’t impose sanctions against companies doing weapons deals with Russia because the threat of sanctions was enough to deter some of those deals. But there is no excuse for not acting against Russia for cyberattacks — Mr. Trump’s own intelligence chiefs say such activity has increased, not diminished. So why is Mr. Trump still ignoring such conclusions? Some have said he is giving Russia a green light to tamper with the 2018 elections. That would have once been an absurd suggestion. It can no longer be dismissed out of hand.",3188

Once a hero of the resistance to apartheid, Mr. Zuma became increasingly embroiled in sordid corruption scandals, prompting the A.N.C. to elect another leader and to effectively force Mr. Zuma out of office. That done, the question now is whether the A.N.C., the party of Nelson Mandela, which has had a near-monopoly on South African politics since the end of minority rule, can cleanse and revive itself under Cyril Ramaphosa, its new leader, who is now all but certain of being elected the nation’s president by Parliament. Mr. Ramaphosa, a onetime labor leader and protégé of Mr. Mandela who made a fortune in business and leads the party’s reformist wing, was elected president of the A.N.C. in a hotly contested election in December. Since Parliament chooses the president in South Africa and the A.N.C. controls Parliament, the expectation was that Mr. Zuma would step down. But he refused, until the party this week threatened a vote of no confidence to force him out. There is nothing to regret in Mr. Zuma’s fall. Though he spent time in prison with Mr. Mandela and in exile, on coming to power he succumbed to the sordid lure of power’s perks and now faces multiple accusations of corruption and other unethical behavior. He also came to be identified with a nation economically adrift and unable to achieve the economic equality promised at the end of white rule. But the A.N.C. continued to prop up Mr. Zuma, at least until the party itself began losing its once unassailable popularity and Mr. Zuma became a liability ahead of national elections in 2019. On winning the leadership of the A.N.C. in December, Mr. Ramaphosa vowed to “act fearlessly against alleged corruption and abuse of office within our ranks.” Yet his victory over Mr. Zuma’s ally (and former wife) in the A.N.C. race was slim, and many Zuma loyalists retain senior posts. That leaves an uphill battle as Mr. Ramaphosa takes on a deeply divided party in which too many years of unchallenged power have nurtured lethargy and a culture of corruption. He will need to act quickly and decisively to convince dubious voters that the A.N.C. can clean its soiled house and deserves another chance.",2312

Chief among them: Can the new opening between the two Koreas, begun amid the feel-good spirit of the Winter Games, be nudged and nurtured into serious dialogue over North Korea’s nuclear program? While still a long shot, there’s a somewhat better chance of engagement now owing to two developments since President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Vice President Mike Pence, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and the North Korean delegation, including Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, attended the Olympic opening ceremony. First was Mr. Kim’s surprise decision to dispatch his sister, his most trusted envoy, to carry his personal invitation for Mr. Moon to join him in a summit meeting in the North. Mr. Moon and Ms. Kim met four times during the Olympics, the highest-level contact between the two Koreas in years. Mr. Moon’s visit would be an even rarer event, since the reclusive Mr. Kim has never met another foreign leader. While many officials fear that North Korea’s primary goal is to drive a wedge between South Korea, which has been eager to engage the North, and the United States, which has resisted engagement, close coordination between Washington and Seoul would keep the alliance strong. At the very least, the North-South contacts provide a communications channel for Seoul to directly explain to Pyongyang what it and the United States are doing and saying and why, thus hopefully avoiding any miscalculation that could lead to military confrontations in this fraught period. The other seemingly positive development was Mr. Pence’s telling The Washington Post that the Trump administration was willing to hold preliminary talks with North Korea even as Washington continues to toughen sanctions and apply other pressures. Only days earlier Mr. Pence insisted there would be no talks until the North made concessions, including taking steps to give up its nuclear weapons. The new iteration would align Mr. Pence with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. President Trump, who has dismissed engagement with North Korea as “appeasement,” hasn’t repudiated Mr. Pence’s comments. The administration has long been hostile to the North and critical of its participation in the Games. In recent days, Mr. Pence used increasingly hostile language, calling the North the most tyrannical regime on the planet. Mr. Pence did not shake hands with, or even smile at, Ms. Kim, as he sat in front of her at the opening ceremony. He could have at least stood when South Korean and North Korean athletes marched in together. North Korea is a reprehensible regime and the world must never forget that. Still, leaders seeking solutions to major problems like North Korea’s nuclear program don’t have the luxury of picking their adversaries. Mr. Pence might have used the occasion to raise American concerns with Ms. Kim directly, although the South Koreans say she didn’t seem to want to speak with him, either. All of which leaves unresolved the question of whether North Korea is exploiting South Korea’s desire for peace in order to secure economic or other benefits and break the alliance with the United States, or it wants to resolve the nuclear crisis and other disputed issues. Neither does anyone know whether Mr. Trump, who has been effective at winning international support for tougher sanctions against North Korea, is serious about pursuing negotiations. Both are wild cards. Much will depend on how the North-South dialogue evolves. But a special burden rests with North Korea, whose nuclear program violates United Nations Security Council resolutions and is a real threat. If Mr. Kim is serious about resolving the crisis, he could send an early signal by releasing the three Americans still held in North Korean prisons or announcing a pause in his nuclear and missiles testing.

This revelation is interesting on several levels, including a question of what that minority of nearly 9 percent is thinking. Surely those people are aware that the chance of their kicking the bucket is 100 percent. Are we to believe that nothing in their basket of wishes is unrealized? The research, published last week in The Journal of Palliative Medicine, was based on a survey of 3,056 people across the United States. Perhaps not surprisingly, those who put stock in religion and spirituality were more likely to compile such a list than those of little faith. The aspiration they listed most commonly is also unsurprising: a desire to travel. Make what you will of the finding that much farther down the scale was a desire to spend quality time with friends and family. There is more to bucket lists than mere wishes. There’s a practical side. The study said that doctors might be better able to figure out the best courses of action for seriously ill patients. One of the researchers, Dr.  Vyjeyanthi Periyakoil of Stanford University, cited the example of a patient who had inoperable cancer of the gallbladder yet would benefit from radiation treatments and chemotherapy. But he also wanted to fulfill a dream of taking his family to Maui. Go to Hawaii while you still can, Dr. Periyakoil told him. It worked out well, she said. This man went to Maui and came back glowing. Had he first had radiation and chemo, his fantasy would have remained just that, a fantasy. Makes sense. Still, it’s not hard to imagine many people having a different reaction — maybe one of near-panic? — on hearing from a physician to not pass Go and to waste no time getting on a plane for that long-sought exotic vacation. Pessimism in the face of one’s mortality is probably more common than sunny carpe diem. Even when they are in reasonably good health, some people of a certain age are inclined to question the wisdom of buying green bananas. These are cosmic issues. A friend, Michael Neill, approaches them by preparing “a reverse bucket list” — activities he never wants to pursue and places he never wants to visit, no matter how long he lives. For what it’s worth, his reverse list includes not climbing Mount Everest, not visiting Las Vegas, not reading Proust and not meeting the Dalai Lama. For some people, a bucket list might bear a degree of pressure. They may think it has to be ambitious, perhaps touched with grandeur. What’s wrong with settling for something simple? Thinking here of Bontshe the Silent. In a classic story written more than a century ago by the Yiddish writer I. L. Peretz, Bontshe has already kicked the bucket. In life, he endured no end of miseries. But he suffered them in silence, never complaining, never cursing God or his fellow man. Now, as he is admitted to Paradise, he is told he can have anything he wants. Anything. At long last, Bontshe speaks. What he would like, this modest man says, is to have a hot roll with fresh butter for breakfast every morning. Not much imagination there. But one could do a lot worse for a bucket list.",3182

Gadi Eisenkot, chief of staff of the Israeli Army, has warned the cabinet that it is on the verge of collapse and there is a real threat of another uprising. In an agonizing picture of life in one of the world’s most crowded enclaves, David M. Halbfinger reported in The Times that daily life there was “unraveling before people’s eyes.” The flow of basic food and supplies entering Gaza from Israel has shrunk, jails are filling with debtors, burglaries are rampant, medical supplies dwindle, water is almost undrinkable and electricity sporadic. Israel has enforced a devastating blockade for more than a decade, since Hamas, the militant Islamist group, came to power there and expelled the Palestinian Authority. Israel, the United States and Europe ordered sanctions against the enclave. The border with Egypt provided a lifeline until it was choked off by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who saw Hamas as an ally of the Muslim Brotherhood. Little has been done to repair the damage of three hugely destructive wars in the last decade. Last year, the Palestinian Authority, seeking to win back control over Gaza, slashed the salaries of thousands of workers still on its payroll and halted payments to Israel for Gaza’s fuel and electricity. That pushed Hamas into a much-heralded agreement with the Palestinian Authority in October, but nothing has come of it. Most recently the Trump administration waded in with a vindictive decision to cut funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which supports Palestinian refugees, including 1.2 million in Gaza. While the blockade and Israeli military attacks have ruined Gaza, there is no defending Hamas, which regularly fires rockets across the border into Israel. Money that should have gone to hospitals and medicine has been spent on futile confrontation with Israel and digging tunnels that the Israelis are now spending a small fortune to block. But holding two million people hostage is not the way to fight Hamas, and the suffering only nurtures more rage and militancy. A majority of Gaza’s two million people are simply trying to survive against lengthening odds and can do little to alleviate their plight. If, as General Eisenkot warned, another uprising lies in the future, that would likely prove futile. It would cause great suffering and destruction again, and might not even rouse the world to Gaza’s plight. The Palestinians no longer seem to be a serious concern even for Arab nations. Israel recently called on donor countries to fund $1 billion in desperately needed water and energy projects in Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, Israel, the United States and international donors must quickly find ways to meet immediate needs. But the only real solution is a peace deal with Israel, which seems more unlikely every day.",2861

As evidence that he was a different kind of Republican, he promised not to cut Medicare, Medicaid and other programs that benefit poor and middle-class families. On Monday, President Trump proposed a budget that would slash spending on Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, transportation and other essential government services, all while increasing the federal deficit. Mr. Trump’s 2019 budget, combined with the tax cuts Republicans passed last year, would amount to one of the greatest transfers of wealth from the poor to the rich in generations. It would also charge trillions of dollars in new debt to the account of future Americans. It’s a plan that could please only far-right ideologues who want to dissolve nearly every part of the federal government, save the military. The proposal would raise military spending by 14.1 percent while cutting funding for the State Department — the agency that has a mandate to resolve problems without going to war — by 26.9 percent. It would cut the Department of Health and Human Services by 20.3 percent and the Department of Education by 10.5 percent. It calls for (yet again) the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and proposes cutting food stamps by $213 billion, or around 30 percent, over 10 years. Medicare and Medicaid, which benefit one-third of Americans, are targeted for cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars. If Congress adopted Mr. Trump’s proposal, millions of people would stand to lose health insurance, subsidized food, low-cost housing and other benefits. The result would be to greatly increase poverty and hunger in America. This is surely not what most of Mr. Trump’s working-class supporters imagined during the primary and general election campaigns. In May 2015, Candidate Trump tweeted, “I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.” And in an April 2016 ad that ran in Pennsylvania he promised to “save Social Security and Medicare without cuts.” But wait, there’s more. Another of Mr. Trump’s promises was to build the “gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways all across our land,” a promise that he referred to as recently as his State of the Union address in January. Yet his budget recommends slashing funding for Amtrak and grant programs that help local and state governments pay for highway and transit projects. Over all, the administration wants to reduce the Department of Transportation’s budget by nearly a fifth. The budget would also effectively cut the Highway Trust Fund by $122 billion over a decade. No doubt Mr. Trump will claim he is still serious about infrastructure by pointing to a separate infrastructure proposal he announced on Monday. In that document, the administration says it will bolster investment by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. But the math simply doesn’t add up. The White House suggests that the federal government would put up only $200 billion, which would be enough to get state and local governments and the private sector to supply the rest of the money. But where would most cities and states find those funds? Already strapped, many will struggle to raise new tax revenue, because the Republican tax law limited the deductibility of state and local taxes. The private sector might be interested, but only in projects like toll roads that produce a steady and rich source of income. It will be tempting for some to dismiss Mr. Trump’s budget as a marketing stunt by his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who was earlier a Tea Party zealot in Congress. After all, Congress last week passed, and Mr. Trump signed, a two-year bipartisan budget that authorizes a significant increase in domestic, as well as military, spending. But presidential budgets are statements of principles. They tend to reveal how administrations will try to change policy and funding levels when Congress comes up with detailed appropriations bills for individual departments. With this budget, the Trump administration is giving notice that it will do everything it can to torpedo the bipartisan budget deal, regardless of the needs of millions of Americans.",4268

The facts of the case are bad enough, but they also underscore another outrage: Vaguely written statutes in many states, including New York, permit police officers to escape sexual assault charges by claiming that the victims consented to the act. The New York State Assembly last week passed legislation to close that odious loophole — and the State Senate, which is considering the same bill, needs to swiftly follow suit. States across the country that may be letting police officers get away with rape need to revisit their statutes as well. The New York City case was particularly disturbing. According to a 50-count indictment unsealed by the Brooklyn district attorney in the fall, two veteran plainclothes detectives took the young woman into custody for having marijuana in her car, and they drove her away from the scene in their police van. Prosecutors say the detectives, who have both pleaded not guilty, raped the woman as she cried and pleaded for them to stop. Lawyers for the detectives subsequently implied that the sex could not be viewed as assault because it was consensual. Elected officials were rightly outraged to find that the state statute prohibiting sexual contact between corrections officers and parole officers and those in their custody does not expressly rule out sexual contact between police officers and people they detain or arrest. After learning that, New York City Council member Mark Treyger introduced a resolution calling on the State Legislature to remedy this problem. The bill that passed the Assembly, and that is pending in the State Senate, would rightly bring police officers under the sexual contact restriction and reinforce the common-sense principle that people whom the police have placed under arrest are legally incapable of consenting to sexual acts with officers, who hold enormous power over them. Much of the country has yet to grasp that fundamental point. An analysis of state statutes by the BuzzFeed News reporter Albert Samaha found that laws in 35 states may be letting officers get away with sexual assault by claiming that the encounters are consensual. Based on a review of a Buffalo News database, including the cases of more than 700 law enforcement officers from across the country accused of sexual misconduct, Mr. Samaha concluded that at least 158 officers had been charged with unlawful sexual conduct with people under their control since 2006 and that at least 26 had been acquitted or had charges dropped as a result of the consent defense. Even officers who were convicted have gotten off with outrageously light sentences. In 2008, a Birmingham, Ala., officer convicted of sodomizing a woman in his custody was sentenced to only 18 months in prison. According to the database, an Arizona tribal officer who pleaded guilty in 2008 to forcing a woman to have sex with him after he arrested her for a traffic offense and lying to the F.B.I., was sentenced to only two years. States clearly need to strengthen laws that are letting officers get off lightly — or even go free — for sexual assault. Only then will predators with badges begin to think twice about how they behave toward the citizens they are meant to protect. Advertisement",3421

Still, President Trump persuaded Congress to increase spending for the program to $14 billion, from $10 billion, in the 2018 budget, claiming in his national security strategy that plans to push the system “will include the ability to defeat missile threats prior to launch.” Mr. Trump is overselling the program, an interlocking network of interceptors, radars, sensors and so-called kill vehicles. He has boasted that the system is 97 percent effective in preventing limited-scale attacks; the truth is more like 50 percent. So its defense against North Korean weapons is hardly a sure thing. The program’s failings were on display as recently as last month, when, during a test off the Hawaiian coast, an interceptor missile launched from a test site in Kauai failed to hit its target, an incoming dummy missile. That was the second failure in three tests of the interceptor, the SM-3, which is intended to be a mainstay of American regional missile defense systems being deployed in Romania, Poland and Japan to guard against medium-range missiles. The Pentagon has not disclosed what went wrong. The problem isn’t just the latest test, though. Since 1999, the program at the heart of the multilayered missile defense system, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, designed to protect the United States by tracking and destroying intercontinental ballistic missiles from a non-superpower adversary, has failed eight of 18 tests. A 2016 Pentagon report faulted the system as demonstrating “a limited capability to defend the U.S. homeland from small numbers” of medium- and long-range missiles “launched from North Korea or Iran.” Experts say the tests are not conducted under realistic conditions, and the test record has not shown sufficient improvement. Meanwhile, in November, North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile that flew higher and longer than previous launches — with a potential range of 8,000 miles — thus increasing the risk that it could soon hit the United States mainland. Analysts attribute many of the problems with the system to the George W. Bush administration’s decision to accelerate it, rushing components into the field prematurely, without proper engineering and testing. Today, the pressures to show success are intensifying as the North Korean threat becomes more acute and Mr. Trump and Congress, desperate to be seen as protecting the American public, throw more money at the program. But like the Reagan-era Star Wars initiative, it will never provide a foolproof, comprehensive shield against a nuclear adversary. There are real questions about whether the program is sustainable, especially if its managers cannot produce better results. A new Pentagon study of the program is expected shortly. Missile defense needs to be part of the United States’ strategy, but it alone will not save the country from a North Korean nuclear attack. Is Mr. Trump, who threatened to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea, aware of this? He would make a serious error if faith in missile defense led him to take military action against North Korea on the ground that the system could save the United States from retaliation. The president would be better off making sure that major powers keep enforcing tough sanctions on North Korea, that South Korea and Japan are prepared for any military action, that North Korea’s avenues for exporting nuclear technology are blocked and that America is ready to test any opening to engage North Korea in negotiations.",3692

Significant progress has been made on both fronts. Yet New York, a national leader in reducing its prison population, could do much more to reform its parole and probation systems. These systems were established across in the United States in the 19th century. The premise was that steering people who commit minor offenses to probation, rather than prison, and shortening prison sentences with parole in exchange for good conduct further the goal of rehabilitation. But that notion fell out of favor after the country embraced mass incarceration in the late 20th century, driving up the prison population from about 200,000 at the start of the 1970s to a peak of 1.6 million at the end of the 2000s. The woefully underfunded parole system fell in line with the jail-first agenda. Parole officers, who were buried under massive caseloads, sent parolees back inside for technical violations, like failing drug tests, missing curfew or socializing with friends they had been forbidden to see. With nearly five million people in the nation under supervision — more than twice the number housed in prisons and jails — the parole and probation systems have become what corrections researchers now describe as a significant driver of recidivism. Even law-and-order states have grasped the need to refashion so-called hair-trigger community supervision systems that reflexively and unnecessarily send people to prison for minor infractions that have no bearing on public safety. Some have hired additional case workers to make their systems more effective, have given newly released inmates better access to drug treatment or mental health care, or have developed community sanctions that send only the most troubled or repeat-prone offenders back to prison. A recent analysis by the reform-focused Council of State Governments Justice Center found that states like Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas have seen dramatic reductions over the last decade in recidivism connected to probation or parole. Then there is New York. The state, which has closed more than a dozen prisons over the last decade alone, is a national standout when it comes to sentencing reform. But a new study from Columbia University’s Justice Lab calls on state lawmakers to do significantly more to address the problems with the community supervision system, which come at a considerable cost to the local jails where most of the people locked up for state parole violations are held. At a time when the number of people being detained in New York City jails is shrinking, state parole violators represent the only subgroup of offenders that is growing. Between 2014 and 2018, for example, the percentage of people held on technical violations of parole increased by 15 percent, even as the overall jail population declined by 21 percent. A November 2017 snapshot count of city inmates found 1,460 people in New York City’s jails for state parole violations. If this were a stand-alone group, the report’s authors note, it would be larger than the population of any jail in the state, with the exception of New York City’s sprawling Rikers Island complex. Among other things, this population is an obstacle to the city’s goal of closing that historically troubled complex altogether. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called on the State Legislature to make changes that would help those in custody for parole violations, such as abolishing money bail for people accused of misdemeanors, eliminating state supervision fees for people on parole and reviewing how child support is calculated for people incarcerated for more than six months. But the Columbia study calls on the Legislature to do a lot more. It recommends that the state adopt several common-sense reforms, most of which have already shown promise in other states. These include: adopting a system of graduated sanctions and rewards, instead of automatically dumping people into jail for minor infractions; capping jail terms for minor parole violations; requiring a judicial hearing before parole officers can jail people accused of technical violations; shortening parole terms for people who stay out of trouble for specified periods of time; and using the savings reaped from cutting the prison population to expand education, substance abuse and housing opportunities for parolees, who need considerably more help than they’re getting to forge stable lives in their communities. These proposals would be a heavy lift in the conservative New York State Senate. But they make good policy and economic sense, and would bring the state to the forefront of the parole reform movement.",5005

These could reach a dangerous new level if the political crisis that erupted last week is allowed to embroil India and China. The current mess started as February began when the country’s Supreme Court unexpectedly decided to nullify sentences against nine of the many opposition figures thrown into prison or forced into exile by President Abdulla Yameen. Among those cleared was Mohamed Nasheed, a former president who won the only fair election the country has had, but was replaced by the corrupt and authoritarian Mr. Yameen. President Yameen refused the court’s ruling, declared a state of emergency and ordered the arrest of two of the court’s five judges, several opposition members and his 80-year-old half-brother, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had earlier ruled the Maldives for 30 years. The remaining judges then nullified the court’s ruling. In a nation of about 430,000 people dispersed over an archipelago in the Indian Ocean — which could well vanish as climate change raises sea levels — that might not seem to pose a clear and present danger for the world. Years ago a coup attempt was snuffed when India, then the country with the greatest influence there, sent in paratroopers. But in recent years, Mr. Yameen has cozied up to China and Saudi Arabia, raising concerns in India that its influence in the Indian Ocean is being challenged. As the crisis ramped up, Mr. Nasheed asked India to intervene, while Mr. Yameen sent envoys to China, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The United Nations and the United States assailed the state of emergency, effectively taking sides against Mr. Yameen. There is no easy way out. Mr. Gayoom still commands loyalty in the security forces; Mr. Nasheed has his following, and having imprisoned his foes, Mr. Yameen knows where he’d end up were he to fall. But turning the islands’ turmoil into a proxy struggle would only make matters far more dangerous. Elections scheduled for later this year offer the best way to restore legitimacy to the government. Mr. Yameen has little incentive in a fair election, but that is where international pressure must be focused.",2278

So he launches a counterattack against the credibility of the investigators and their chief, and assails media reports as “fake news.” Sound familiar? In this case, though, it’s Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, who is bracing for police investigators to conclude two long corruption investigations as early as next week by presenting their recommendations to the attorney general. What they will recommend is not publicly known, though it is known that one case under investigation involves gifts from benefactors, and the other allegations that Mr. Netanyahu tried to get favorable coverage from a newspaper in exchange for curtailing a competitor. The attorney general could choose to indict; or he could do nothing, or just issue a reprimand, which would legally allow Mr. Netanyahu to stay in the office he has occupied for a total of 12 years now. Mr. Netanyahu, who has been called Mr. Teflon for his ability to weather earlier police inquiries, has repeatedly insisted that the current investigations “will come to nothing, because there is nothing.” Still, he is taking no chances. (His predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced out of office over police accusations of corruption and ended up serving 16 months of a 27-month prison term for bribery and obstruction of justice.) Things got nasty on Wednesday when the police commissioner, Roni Alsheich, appointed to his current post by Mr. Netanyahu, gave a television interview in which he reiterated earlier allegations that powerful people had hired private detectives to gather information about officers working on the Netanyahu case. Mr. Netanyahu called the allegations “delusional and mendacious” and questioned whether people who make such charges can be impartial in their investigation. In fact, Mr. Alsheich is not directly in charge of the investigation, which is being handled by a special anticorruption unit. And the investigations have been conducted with the oversight of the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, who was also appointed to his position by Mr. Netanyahu and who has strongly defended the police against those who would “weaken the public trust in the rule of law.” Mr. Netanyahu will have plenty of opportunity to defend himself, politically, legally, publicly and morally, against whatever he might stand accused of. There is no defense for self-serving efforts to undermine the institutions and rule of law he’s sworn to uphold.",2511
5a7f485a47de81a901208ec0,2018-02-10T19:30:26+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/opinion/sunday/republicans-deficit-debt.html,Editorial,"So much for all that sanctimony about fiscal responsibility. Forever and always, it can now be said that Republican lawmakers care about the federal deficit only when they want to use it to bash Democratic presidents. After embracing $1.5 trillion in debt by slashing taxes on corporations and wealthy families in December, the Republican leaders in Congress pushed through a two-year budget deal on Friday that will increase spending by nearly $400 billion. While a lot of that money will be spent on important priorities like disaster relief, infrastructure and education, a big chunk of it will go to an excessive and unnecessary military buildup. Contrast this with the parsimony Republican lawmakers displayed in 2011 when they refused to raise the federal debt limit until President Barack Obama agreed to deep cuts to government programs. “If you were against President Obama’s deficits, and now you’re for the Republican deficits, isn’t that the very definition of hypocrisy?” Senator Rand Paul said as he held up passage of the budget bill for a few hours — perhaps until he realized that the definition fit him, too, since he had voted for the tax cuts that will blow up the deficit. Deficit spending can be an indispensable tool — to revive an ailing economy, invest in productive infrastructure, rebuild after natural disasters and pay for unavoidable wars. And it was vital for the government to run large deficits after the financial crisis, when the country was tumbling into the worst recession since the Depression. But the Republican leaders who opposed stimulus spending in 2011 and 2012, when many Americans were struggling to find jobs and the economy was in the doldrums, are now making the absurd argument that the government ought to do more to fuel the economy at a time when the unemployment rate is about half what it was back then and corporate profits have soared. Even with the economy growing at a decent clip, the government should raise spending on domestic programs that were slashed when Republicans demanded deep cuts. Nondefense spending relative to the economy is the lowest it has been since 1961 — 3.1 percent of gross domestic product, far below the long-term average of 3.8 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dilapidated roads, bridges, railways and water systems need to be upgraded and repaired. Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida still need help recovering from last year’s hurricanes and making themselves more resilient to future storms. Lawmakers also must spend more to end the opioid epidemic and increase access to substance abuse treatment. The budget bill only partly addresses many of these and other needs. But the deal Mr. Trump approved on Friday also includes a $165 billion increase in military spending over two years, more than the Trump administration had even requested. Military spending will jump to $716 billion in 2019, from $634 billion in 2017. In inflation-adjusted terms, that would put the Pentagon’s budget well above the Reagan buildup of the 1980s and nearly as high as in 2010 — the peak of military spending since World War II — when more than 200,000 troops were deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Even before this latest increase, the Pentagon’s budget exceeded the combined military spending of the next eight biggest defense spenders globally — a list that includes Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and India. Some of the defense increases are understandable. The cost per active service member grew by 61 percent from 2001 to 2012, after adjusting for inflation, because of new and expanded benefits such as incentive bonuses, raises and increased health care expenses. But other increases arose from a dysfunctional budget process manipulated by a defense industry that woos Congress with unneeded or extravagant weapons. These include the F-35 fighter jet, missile defense programs that are plagued with problems, and a plan to modernize the nuclear arsenal over a period of 30 years at a cost of more than $1 trillion. Democrats went along with this budget. They’re the minority party and have limited leverage, and at the moment they are not deploying it very effectively, as has been demonstrated by their failure thus far to clarify their priorities or win protection from deportation for the Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. The true culprits are the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Both are self-proclaimed deficit hawks. “In this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time,” Mr. Ryan declared in 2012. But recent actions have revealed that the real game is to cut taxes on businesses and the wealthy, and use the resulting deficits as a pretext for cutting programs like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security that benefit the poor and the middle class. President Trump has been a bystander in this whole process. He signed the bill, though it ignores many of the administration’s requests by, for example, increasing spending on the National Institutes of Health rather than cutting it. All told, the Republican tax cuts and the budget deal will nearly double the federal deficit to $1.19 trillion in 2019. While no credible analyst doubts that the federal government, which spends about $4 trillion a year, can make its debt payments, the growing deficit will make it harder for the government to respond to future recessions or to make responsible spending decisions. It’s a sure bet that, were the economy to tank, Mr. Ryan and his ilk would argue that the country couldn’t afford to increase government spending to get it going again because the deficit was already too large.",5760

Andrew Cuomo says New York must at long last bring its elections into the 21st century by, among other things, joining the large majority of states that permit early voting. He’s right. Mr. Cuomo, however, has so far set aside no state funds to carry out this change, which means New York’s 62 counties would have to pick up the tab. This is regrettable. But it’s also fixable. To show he means business in this matter, the governor has until Thursday to add the necessary money before he hits a deadline in this stage of the budget process. We’re not talking about vast amounts of cash. Quite the contrary. Some officials have estimated it would cost as little as $6.4 million to enable New Yorkers to vote across a stretch of days instead of solely on Election Day, Nov. 6 this year. With a budget weighing in at $168 billion, the state spends at a rate of about $320,000 a minute. Early voting would thus be a mere 20-minute expense. If this burden is foisted on the counties, some might wheeze under the strain. Localities in New York have long complained, justifiably, about a pattern of “unfunded mandates” — requirements that come from Albany without so much as a nickel to make them happen. If ever there was an issue of statewide concern, and fiscal obligation, voting is it. Mr. Cuomo’s aides argue that keeping money out of the discussion is a sensible tactic at this point. Don’t let hand-wringing over dollars, no matter how few, get in the way of the principle of electoral reform, they say. But a counterargument can be made that covering the cost now in his budget would demonstrate that the governor is dead serious about this issue. There’s no guarantee that the Legislature will go along with any request for change, which in Mr. Cuomo’s formulation would also permit automatic voter registration, Election Day registration, and absentee voting without having to offer an excuse. These ideas have died in the past in Albany, typically at the hands of Republicans, who control the State Senate and worry that anything that enhances voter turnout could work to their disadvantage. Some of the proposed changes require amending the State Constitution. Early voting is not one of them. All that’s needed is for lawmakers to say yes. Keeping polling stations open across a stretch of days is hardly a radical system. It exists in varying forms in 37 states of both the red and the blue variety. It is also popular among New Yorkers; a Siena College poll last month showed a support rate of 65 percent. For a state that fancies itself a bastion of progressivism, New York remains frozen in electoral practices that amount to an incumbent-protection racket. Take the restrictions on changing party affiliations. As races develop, some registered voters may realize they want to switch allegiances ahead of primaries in June (for federal offices) and September (for state offices). They’re already too late. The deadline expired four months ago — ridiculously early. Early voting is an easy test for both lawmakers and the governor to prove their seriousness of purpose in shoring up democracy in the state. All it would take is 20 minutes’ worth of money.",3216

President Trump was “very saddened” by the reports, a spokesman, Raj Shah, said at Thursday’s news briefing. Mr. Shah added that the White House does “take violence against women and these types of allegations very seriously.” Those are the sorts of sentiments you’d want to hear from the president and his staff after such revelations. Of course, it’d be easier to take them at face value if his chief of staff, John Kelly, hadn’t reportedly known about the allegations against Mr. Porter since the fall, and if Mr. Trump’s first wife hadn’t accused him of rape and if more than a dozen women hadn’t said he sexually molested, assaulted and harassed them. That’s not to mention his own taped admission of grabbing women by the genitals. It would be even easier to take seriously the official White House line about Mr. Porter if officials there had shown any appetite to fight violence against women. If they become interested in doing more than talk, here are some ideas: Name a White House adviser on violence against women, a position created during the Obama administration that has gone unfilled for the past year. Likewise, the Trump administration has not appointed anyone to head the Department of Justice’s Office of Violence Against Women, nor to be the State Department’s ambassador at large for global women’s issues. Advocate full funding of the Violence Against Women Act, which is the principal tool for focusing federal attention on domestic abuse. The law, passed in 1994, has directed billions of dollars toward policing and prosecuting offenders as well as providing legal and other services to victims. Cases of domestic violence in the United States have dropped precipitously as a result. And yet, since Mr. Trump was elected, its proponents have lived in constant fear of funding cuts. Beyond declaring it a funding priority, the Justice Department should be directed to make enforcing the law a priority, too. Push for more federal research dollars toward preventing domestic violence. Family abuse is a massive public health problem in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four women and one in nine men are the victims of intimate partner violence in their lifetime. Yet significantly more research is needed on what drives batterers to abuse their partners and how best to prevent this particular form of domestic terror. Urge Congress to close loopholes in gun prohibitions for domestic abusers. Nearly half of women and girls killed in the United States are the victims of a current or former romantic partner, and in most cases, the weapon is a gun. Congress, in 1996, passed legislation to keep guns out of the hands of people who commit domestic violence, but over time, clear loopholes have emerged. Addressing those gaps could save thousands of lives every year. For example, a 20-year-old law prohibits those convicted in the assault of a spouse or a child from owning or buying guns. But it doesn’t apply to boyfriends, girlfriends, other family members or stalkers. That must change. But first and foremost, the White House needs to find out, and tell the public, which administration officials knew about the allegations against Mr. Porter and when they learned that information. A president who really wants to signal that he is serious about respecting women would fire every official who protected or defended Mr. Porter after they learned of the abuse allegations.",3583

After months in which President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, have escalated their angry words and the risk of nuclear war, the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, is using the Olympics to reopen long-dormant contacts with the North and possibly establish a formal channel of communication with Mr. Kim. Athletes are participating in this diplomatic pas de deux; the South Koreans and North Koreans will be marching side by side in the opening festivities on Friday and playing jointly for the first time on the women’s ice hockey team. Top Trump administration officials, and many experts, doubt that anything serious will come of the South Korean initiative. They think it will just help North Korea engage in a charm offensive while it presses against sanctions and refuses to give up its nuclear program. But the outreach is necessary and courageous. Mr. Moon, elected last year on a promise to improve ties with North Korea, will deserve credit if his efforts help reduce the North Korean threat. One good sign is that Mr. Moon has persuaded key foreign officials to attend the Olympics opening ceremony and thus be in proximity in case diplomatic fairy dust creates an opportunity for interaction. Not only are Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and Vice President Mike Pence expected to show up, but also two senior North Korean officials: Mr. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, the first immediate member of the North’s ruling family ever to set foot in the South, and Kim Yong-nam, the country’s nominal head of state. On Saturday, Mr. Moon plans to host the North Korean delegation for lunch with the goal of restoring a high-level dialogue between the two countries after a hiatus of more than two years and of opening the door, maybe later this year, to a meeting between himself and Mr. Kim. At a minimum, the lunch provides an opportunity for Mr. Moon to make clear directly to the North Korean leaders the risks and costs of failing to ease tensions, fueled mainly by the North’s accelerated push to develop its arsenal of nuclear warheads and the missiles with which to deliver them. North Korean officials have a hard time reading political signals from Washington, so frank discussions are crucial. Whether Mr. Pence or Mr. Abe are open to even a brief discussion with the North Koreans is unclear. They have taken a much tougher stance against North Korea than Mr. Moon, creating a dangerous gap among the allies. En route to South Korea, Mr. Pence sent mixed signals, suggesting on Monday that he might be open to a meeting, then on Wednesday announcing plans to impose the toughest sanctions yet on the North over its nuclear and missile programs. He told The Washington Post that “when the Olympics are long a distant memory,” the administration hoped “to continue to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically.” Mr. Pence will attend the Games with the father of Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who was imprisoned by North Korea, then died suddenly when he was returned to his family last year. Any contacts would be complicated by the fact that Ms. Kim is under American sanctions for her role in North Korea’s human rights abuses. No matter how difficult it will be to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis, the United States and its allies need to exhaust all diplomatic options. The administration must do more to coordinate with South Korea and treat this vital ally with respect. This is at last a moment of sanity in what has been a problem hurtling toward a military confrontation. If nothing comes of South Korea’s initiative, the United States is likely to resume military exercises and the North is likely to resume nuclear and missile testing, touching off another escalatory spiral. Nothing good can come of that, given Mr. Trump’s threat to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea, and Mr. Kim’s threat to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. Mr. Trump can continue to apply “maximum pressure” against the North and still help Mr. Kim’s pursuit of engagement.",4209

Even as this behavior, known as partisan gerrymandering, has gotten out of control in recent decades, the court has refused to rein it in because, the claim goes, any possible fix lies with the political branches and not the courts. That’s bunk. The justices will see why if they look at what’s happening in several states where lawmakers have been holding clinics in self-interested mapmaking. Both Democrats and Republicans draw biased maps, of course — the two cases before the Supreme Court this term make that clear — but modern partisan gerrymandering is mostly the work of Republicans, who control a majority of governorships, as well as the legislative chambers in 32 states. Their efforts to lock in this advantage by any means necessary — including by kneecapping any institutions, including the courts, that try to stop them — are the work of a party that has become, as the political scientists Norm Ornstein and Thomas Mann put it in 2012, “dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.” At stake are not just hundreds of state legislative seats, but also control of the House of Representatives, which Republicans currently hold by a 45-seat margin. The most shocking case is playing out right now in Pennsylvania, where Republican lawmakers in 2011 created maps so skewed that when Democrats won a majority of the popular vote the following year, it translated into only five of the state’s 18 congressional seats. Indefensible, right? That’s how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court saw it last month, striking down the maps for “clearly, plainly and palpably” violating the state’s Constitution, and ordering lawmakers to submit new, fairer maps to the governor by Friday. If they don’t, the court will substitute its own nonpartisan maps by Feb. 19, in time for the state’s primary elections in May. Pennsylvania Republicans are furious. The president pro tempore of the State Senate, Joe Scarnati, refused to comply with the court’s order to turn over data concerning the state’s current district lines, arguing that the justices overstepped their authority. G.O.P. leaders appealed to the United States Supreme Court to block the order, but their request was denied on Monday by Justice Samuel Alito Jr. When the Supreme Court speaks, that’s usually the end of the matter. Not this time. A Republican legislator this week moved to impeach the five Pennsylvania justices who voted to strike down the maps, on the grounds that they “engaged in misbehavior in office.” Pennsylvania’s judges are elected in partisan campaigns, and all five in the majority are Democrats. The two dissenters are Republicans. Electing judges, as a practice, is a bad idea that should be done away with nationwide. Still, forcibly removing a judge for making decisions that offend the governing party is, to put it gently, not tolerable in a democracy. It’s a profound threat to the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. And yet, thanks to the turbocharged gerrymandering the state’s Republicans managed to pull off seven years ago, they have a large enough majority to do it. Worse, they are far from alone in their efforts to rig the electoral process. In North Carolina, G.O.P. legislators in 2011 drew such biased districts — one election-law scholar called them the “most brazen and egregious” maps in the country — that they managed to win nine of 13 House seats, despite getting just 49 percent of the statewide popular vote. Republicans now hold 10 of those 13 seats, but even that wasn’t enough for them, especially after 2016, when voters elected a Democrat, Roy Cooper, as governor and gave liberals a 4-to-3 edge on the State Supreme Court. Almost immediately, Republicans struck back, stripping the new governor of many powers, attempting to redraw judicial districts, requiring judges to identify their party affiliation on ballots and reducing the size of the state’s Court of Appeals, in order to keep Mr. Cooper from replacing retiring Republicans. In other words, if you can’t win the game under the existing rules, change the rules. State and federal courts have ruled against many of these moves, and have invalidated Republican-created district maps and voting laws that were created to thwart black political power in the state. Most significantly, in January a three-judge panel of a federal court struck down North Carolina’s district maps for being “motivated by invidious partisan intent,” and violating the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. But the Supreme Court put that ruling on hold, which means the current Republican-friendly maps will almost certainly be in use for the 2018 midterms. So this is where we are: Increasingly partisan actors, mainly on the right, are wielding high-end mapmaking tools to lock in their party’s majority for years or longer, then hobbling another branch of government that is trying to rein them in. And the Supreme Court still thinks gerrymandering can be fixed through the political process?",5266

But do we really want to spike the ball at a time when the country is embroiled in two wars, with no end in sight? The president seems to think so. President Trump, apparently taken by the Bastille Day parade in Paris, which he attended last summer, has instructed Pentagon brass to organize an even bigger show of military strength, down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington — tanks, missiles, jets and rows of uniformed troops marching in precision. “We’re going to have to try to top” the French procession, he told reporters. No date has been set, but the planning is underway. It’s all a bit silly. But leaving aside, for the moment, Mr. Trump’s insecurities and his desire to do everything bigger than anyone else, there are some serious reasons to reject his idea. Mr. Trump’s parade would further militarize America’s image. And it would be expensive, costing millions of dollars and most likely tearing up Washington’s streets. Does that make sense when the Pentagon is complaining that its $700 billion annual budget is inadequate, Congress is cutting vital programs, the State Department is being eviscerated and a Republican tax cut for the wealthy has added billions of dollars to the deficit? The United States used to regularly hold national military parades, generally to mark military victories. They took place after the Civil War, World War I and World War II. Most recently, the first President George Bush presided as 8,800 troops, with weapons, marched through Washington after the 1991 Persian Gulf war ended. But after American combat troops were withdrawn from Iraq in 2011, the Pentagon declined a ticker-tape parade in New York for gulf war veterans, saying it would not be proper while Americans were still fighting in Afghanistan. So what would be the purpose of organizing such a parade today, with Americans still fighting in Afghanistan and again in Iraq? The White House says Mr. Trump wants to support “America’s great service members who risk their lives every day.” Yet, especially since 9/11, most Americans have been acutely aware of, and overtly appreciative of, the service of military troops and emergency medical workers, who are regularly recognized at public events and in public speeches. Mr. Trump, who dodged the Vietnam War with five deferments, has developed an unusual reliance on the military. His defense secretary and chief of staff are retired generals, and his national security adviser, another general, is still on active duty. The president is doing everything he can to make the Pentagon his prime instrument of national security policy by promising “one of the greatest military buildups in history,” expanding the nation’s nuclear arsenal and issuing threats to use military force. Mr. Trump is trying to exploit the armed forces as a political prop, even as he daily undermines the country’s other real and enduring strengths, including an independent judiciary and a free press. During the Cold War, such military spectacles were a hallmark of the Soviets. Today, North Korea regularly stages its own robotic displays of military power in an effort to intimidate adversaries. To defend itself and its allies, the United States must have a strong military. Yet what Americans and the world need from Mr. Trump is not martial pageantry, but a demonstration that he understands that national strength relies on much more than military power.",3461
5a7ba5e0d4211f00015bfe67,2018-02-08T01:20:28+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/opinion/trump-backward-immigration.html,Editorial,"Congress now appears likely to reach a budget deal to keep the government functioning without treating as bargaining chips hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were children. It also appears, though, that President Trump will consider undoing his threat of deportation for these young “Dreamers” only if Congress considers the first deep cuts to legal immigration since the 1920s. The changes the president is demanding stem from a nativist, zero-sum view that what’s good for immigrants is bad for America. That view runs counter not just to the best of American tradition and principles, but to evidence of what’s best for the country. The programs targeted by Mr. Trump are designed to make legal immigration more diverse and humane. One is the lottery system that offers the chance for visas to people from countries that are underrepresented as sources of American immigrants; the other is family-based immigration, which offers visas to close relatives of citizens and legal residents. Mr. Trump, who has regularly smeared immigrants as terrorists and criminals, has lately been focusing his fear-mongering on the diversity visa program. Last month, his Department of Homeland Security released a report that dishonestly claimed that those who entered the country via the lottery were more likely to be tied to terrorist attacks. The Cato Institute found that lottery visa holders actually killed only eight of 3,037 Americans murdered by foreign-born terrorists since 1975. The immigrants chosen in the lottery, moreover, are not chosen “without any regard for skill, merit or the safety of our people,” as Mr. Trump said in his State of the Union address. They must have at least a high school education or two years of experience in skilled work, and they must also undergo criminal, national security and medical checks. The 50,000 recipients of the visas are not guaranteed permanent residence, only a chance at getting through the rest of the immigration process. Mr. Trump has said that the family reunification program — which he and other immigration opponents prefer to call “chain migration” — opens the floodgates to “virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.” In fact, relatives other than spouses, parents and minor children are subject to annual caps and country quotas, so that, today, the backlog is almost four million applicants, most of them facing many years of waiting to get a visa. Mr. Trump would allow no new applicants other than immediate family members, and even these would no longer include parents. Imposing these restrictions and ending the diversity visa lottery would cut in half the number of legal immigrants. It is hard to gauge how much of what Mr. Trump says is meant as a scare tactic and how much he really will demand. The one notion that runs through all he says or tweets about immigration is that it is a door for criminals and terrorists to enter the United States. Yet data studied by the Cato Institute indicates that diversity-visa holders and illegal immigrants, the groups most maligned by Mr. Trump, are far less prone to crime than native-born Americans. Politicians have wrestled for decades with how to deal with immigrants who are in the United States illegally — now around 11 million people. But immigration in itself has been widely regarded as good for America and for the American dream. The preponderance of evidence shows that immigrants help the economy grow. They are more likely to own businesses or to start businesses than the native-born; of the 87 privately held companies currently valued at more than $1 billion, 51 percent had immigrant founders. There are questions worth examining and debating about whether the United States ought to admit more skilled immigrants and what criteria it uses to screen applicants. But such a debate can’t unfold in the shadow of Mr. Trump’s threat to imminently expel the Dreamers. So what is Mr. Trump really after? A Gallup poll last June found 62 percent of Americans support maintaining current levels of immigration or even increasing them. And since the country is at nearly full employment, the timing of these anti-immigrant demands might seem odd. Yet it’s no more odd than the president’s tough-on-crime talk at a time when crime is lower than it’s ever been, or his obsession with Islamist terrorists, even though the Government Accountability Office found that right-wing extremists have committed far more domestic attacks against Americans since 2001. Mr. Trump’s approach seems intended less to rationalize the immigration system than to inflame his core supporters by demonizing nonwhite people, as he did when he disparaged immigrants from nations like Haiti and Mexico while praising Norwegians. Members of Congress know better, and they are aware that there are sensible measures that would clear the immediate hurdle and produce a bipartisan deal. Senators John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, have offered a stopgap bill that would end the threat to the Dreamers while strengthening border security. Nothing about diversity visas or family-based migration, nothing for the wasteful wall. That makes sense. The way we deal with legal immigration should not be changed without a thorough, honest debate.",5340

There was even some hope that Mr. Namazi, an 81-year-old former diplomat for Unicef, might be granted parole. On Tuesday, those hopes were dashed as the authorities ordered the ailing Mr. Namazi to return to jail, a decision so lacking in compassion that the Trump administration must intervene. “The powers that be have directed me to return to prison today despite the strong recommendation of Iran’s medical examiner and my physicians that my health cannot withstand further incarceration,” Mr. Namazi said in a note released by his American lawyer, Jared Genser. Mr. Namazi was rushed to the hospital on Jan. 15 after suffering a severe drop in blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. It was the fourth time he’d been hospitalized in the past year, including for emergency heart surgery in September to install a pacemaker. His doctors recommended a further three-month medical leave. Mr. Namazi’s family members are understandably concerned that returning to prison will jeopardize his life even more. “How can the Iranian authorities knowingly risk my father’s life, knowing it will end in a tragedy?” said Babak Namazi, one of Baquer’s sons. Another son, Siamak, 46, a businessman and dual citizen who had been an advocate for improved American-Iranian relations, remains imprisoned as well. Babak said his brother had been abused while in prison, including through electric shock. In a secretive October 2016 trial, the two men were convicted of collaborating with a hostile power — the United States. Their convictions and 10-year sentences were upheld last November on appeal. The details of the charges against them have never been fully explained. At least two other American citizens are known to be imprisoned in Iran: Xiyue Wang, a Princeton graduate student who was seized while working on his doctoral thesis, and Karan Vafadari, a Tehran art gallery owner. Another American, Robert Levinson, has been missing in Iran for more than 10 years. Other foreign citizens have also been detained, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a Briton of Iranian descent employed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, who was sentenced to five years. These detentions have worsened tensions between Iran and the West following the 2015 deal under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for a lifting of economic sanctions. The result is that some Westerners, especially those with dual Iranian citizenship, are now more cautious about visiting Iran, fearing arbitrary arrest. Iranian officials say that the United States or its allies have unfairly imprisoned or prosecuted at least 14 Iranians, mostly for what the officials call unfounded charges of sanctions violations. Granting Mr. Namazi a short-term medical leave and then extending it seemed like one possible way to break the logjam. The Trump administration has reportedly asked Iran to set up a private channel to discuss such humanitarian issues, but there has been no response from Tehran. The speculation is that the hard-liners who control Iran’s judiciary and intelligence services are refusing to budge. Mr. Trump and his State Department should continue trying to engage Iran. It’s not in the interest of either country for Mr. Namazi, or any other political prisoner, to die in jail.",3457

Though some pundits stoked panic with their coverage of several days of market plunges before Tuesday’s leap, stock prices are still near their record highs, the economy is creating jobs and many workers are finally getting decent raises after years of stagnant wages. Which doesn’t mean that there’s nothing to worry about. In recent months, time after time, both the current administration and its allies in Congress have called into question their credibility and competence to manage the economy or handle a financial crisis if one were to occur. President Trump has repeatedly patted himself on the back for a surging stock market, seemingly unaware that stocks can go down, not just up. His Treasury Department in December released a one-page analysis that made outlandish economic assumptions to justify giant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy families. Republican lawmakers in Congress went even further, attacking the Congressional Budget Office and Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, both nonpartisan, because those analysts had the temerity to warn that the tax law would add to the federal deficit. Mr. Trump wants everyone to know that his election delivered a booster shot to the economy and stocks. “The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,” he told reporters in November. Truth is, the president was just lucky enough to have inherited a growing economy and a rising stock market. Though his tax cuts were an expensive gift to investors, he has not been in office long enough to have fundamentally changed that trajectory. But his erratic behavior and poor policy choices are clearly worrying the majority of Americans who disapprove of the president. One reason some investors have become nervous recently is they fear that the tax cuts, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers sold as a way to stimulate the economy, could end up hurting the economy in the not so distant future. The tax law and a push by the Trump administration to increase military spending will reduce federal revenue and force the Treasury to borrow more money when the economy is close to full employment. This could stoke inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. That, in turn, would slow the economy. The prospect of a recession or financial crisis on Mr. Trump’s watch is unnerving, because he is as confident in his own abilities as he is lacking in knowledge and sound judgment. When confronted with criticism, he lashes out like an intemperate child. On Monday, he said Democrats who did not applaud during his State of the Union address were un-American and treasonous. If the stock market falls further, will the president try to reassure the public, or will he launch a Twitter fusillade blaming the drop on, say, a conspiracy hatched by the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge fund manager who wants Mr. Trump impeached? Many people would have been more sanguine about the Trump presidency had he surrounded himself with competent aides and advisers. Instead, he has stacked his administration with incompetent yes men, right-wing ideologues and Washington swamp dwellers. Consider the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a former investment banker, who unnerved the currency market last month by suggesting that the United States was trying to weaken the dollar. His statement broke with the longstanding practice followed by Treasury secretaries from both parties to avoid making careless public pronouncements about American currency. Mr. Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the White House’s chief economic adviser, also debased their credibility last year by arguing with no evidence whatsoever that the Republican tax cut would pay for itself. Over in Congress, the Republican House speaker, Paul Ryan, tried to pass off as good economic news that a public school secretary would take home an extra $1.50 a week as a result of the tax law. Then there is the harm wrought by the tax law. By greatly expanding the deficit, it will limit the federal government’s ability to stimulate the economy in the future when it actually needs a jump-start. In many ways the tax law is already having a perverse effect. Mr. Ryan, for one, is citing the deficit to make the case that the government needs to slash Medicaid, Medicare and other important government programs. Other members of his party are using the deficits to argue that the government cannot afford to repair and upgrade the country’s dilapidated infrastructure. A big drop in stock prices focuses minds, especially when it comes after years of relatively steady gains. But the real crisis is in Washington, not on Wall Street.",4723

They also live by pasta, meatballs, rice balls, jam, tea and wine, among other comestibles. Food and drink as code words for bribes are hard-wired into the language of many cultures, and several criminal cases of late offer a spicy taste. A federal corruption trial is underway in New York for Joseph Percoco, a close ally and family friend of Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Among the allegations is that Mr. Percoco, with all the eloquence of Tony Soprano and his associates, referred to bribe money as boxes of “ziti.” In Pennsylvania, the mayor of Allentown, Ed Pawlowski, is fending off bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges. His federal case turns in part on whether recorded conversations about picking up “meatballs” meant collecting payoffs or actually getting ready to eat. Then there’s the approaching trial of a Maryland state senator, Nathaniel Oaks, who federal prosecutors say used “lollipops” as code for illicit cash in $1,000 bundles. Sounds almost like a meal with a few basic food groups: carbohydrates, protein, fats. It’s the sort of menu that Harendra Singh might have considered for the restaurant he operated on city property in Long Island City, Queens. Recently unsealed court papers show that Mr. Singh secretly pleaded guilty to bribery and told federal authorities that he had made campaign contributions to Mayor Bill de Blasio — referred to in the documents as “Official #2” — to buy favorable lease terms for himself. Mr. de Blasio has denied any wrongdoing, and, indeed, no charges have been brought against him. Still, at the start of his second term, the mayor seems unable to shake fully free of questions about his ethical compass. In effect, the authorities said Mr. Singh was guilty of handing a bribe to a political leader who was not charged with accepting it. Voters may be forgiven if they are a bit confused and, perhaps, puzzled over this immaculate reception. Around the world, some politicians require graft for sustenance; gustatory metaphors and euphemisms are not uniquely American. In France, a bribe is a “pot of wine.” It’s “something for a soft drink” in Portugal, “a cup of coffee” in Syria, “tea money” in China. Corrupt payments in Germany are described as “saftig,” or juicy. Italians have “pizzo” for extortion, derived not from pizza but from a Sicilian expression for “letting someone wet his beak.” In Japan, onigiri, a rice ball, may refer to bribe money stuffed inside that dish. A wad of cash in Russia is a “cutlet.” Payoffs in Colombia may be described as “mermelada,” Spanish for jam. “Mordida,” meaning bite, is Mexico’s food-related term. In parts of the Arab world, it is said of a group new to power that “it’s their turn to eat now.” And in Israel, words like “Champagne” and “meal ordering” are being used in a corruption scandal involving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara. Hang on, that’s not quite right. For a change, this isn’t food as metaphor. It’s the real thing. The Netanyahus are the targets of investigations into whether she wrongly sneaked in catered meals at taxpayer expense and whether he illegally accepted gifts of Champagne and expensive cigars. Beats ziti and meatballs, some would say.",3315

Instead, China is creating its own institutions, or reshaping existing institutions and norms, to suit its own needs. Leaders in many of these countries are watching warily as China encourages the notion that the Chinese model of central economic and political direction could eventually supplant Western democracy and its capitalist system. The Pentagon is so concerned that it named China, along with Russia, America’s top security threats for seeking to “shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model — gaining veto authority over other nations’ economic, diplomatic and security decisions.” It makes perfect sense that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, wants to see his country play a greater international role. China enjoys a growing economy, substantial military strength and very stable leadership. But that does not give it license to unilaterally reorder the Indo-Pacific region to its advantage, as the Pentagon asserted. A focused and forward-looking American president would work to counter such moves. President Trump, blinded by Mr. Xi’s flattery and blind to history, does nothing except cede more power to Beijing. Mr. Xi, a powerful authoritarian leader, has the advantage of seeming to know where he is leading his country. Mr. Trump, politically weakened and under investigation by the special counsel, vacillates between declaring economic war on China and wanting to be Mr. Xi’s friend. In Beijing in November, for instance, Mr. Trump lavished praise on Mr. Xi and declared that he did not blame China for the out-of-balance trade relationship. Weeks later, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he seemed to forecast a trade war, saying, “The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies and pervasive state-led economic planning.” Last month, he slapped tariffs on the solar panel industry, a move that will hurt businesses in China and other countries but is unlikely to make American manufacturers competitive with dominant Chinese ones. It was alarming to watch Mr. Trump cede diplomatic ground to China early in his presidency, because America is the natural counterweight. He withdrew from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate agreement, called into question the North American Free Trade Agreement and rejected the Iran nuclear deal, alienating allies. Meanwhile, China is exercising influence in others ways, like creating an Asian infrastructure bank and building artificial islands in the South China Sea for military bases. It has eclipsed the United States as the leading trading partner for Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru, prompting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to warn countries against this trend before a trip to the region this weekend. China’s biggest play could be a plan to spend more than $1 trillion on roads, power plants, bridges, cyber networks and other projects in countries across Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America to expand markets and political influence. Despite concerns that this “One Belt, One Road” initiative could burden participating countries with debt, many countries are already involved or intend to become involved. By contrast, Mr. Trump is cutting back on America’s already modest foreign aid budget. Beijing even took aim at democracy via a state newspaper, saying that while the American system is supposed to be politically superior, the recent federal government shutdown showed it was rived by chaos and “chronic flaws.” The critics may have a point. In the past year, public faith in America’s major institutions collapsed, according to a survey by the Edelman communications firm. Whereas faith in China’s government jumped eight points, to 84 percent, in the United States it fell 14 points, to 33 percent, the steepest decline ever measured among Americans and the biggest decline of all 28 countries polled. That’s a warning for democracies to resolve their internal conflicts, though, not an argument for authoritarian rule. To an extent, Mr. Trump is pushing back. American ships have stepped up patrols in the South China Sea to assert freedom of navigation. The White House persuaded China to support tighter sanctions on North Korea. So far, though, it’s not clear that Mr. Trump has a real strategy to manage these complex policy strands effectively. Most Asian countries want the United States to lead both in cooperating with and counterbalancing Beijing, and no one wants to have to choose between the two behemoths. The Chinese-American relationship has become more competitive and fraught, and will remain so. It will be up to both powers to prevent competition from sliding into confrontation.",4892

With a Super Bowl commercial on Sunday that used as its soundtrack a sermon delivered by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 50 years earlier to the day, they got the notice they wanted. Much of the reaction, though, amounted to a richly deserved thumbs-down. The sermon was Dr. King’s “Drum Major Instinct” speech, given in Atlanta in 1968 two months before his assassination. Everybody, he said, had this instinct — “a desire to be out front, a desire to lead the parade, a desire to be first.” But it had to be harnessed, he said as he went on to equate greatness with service to others. Ostensibly, the Ram commercial was an appeal for people to serve. But who’s kidding whom? The goal was to sell trucks, with Dr. King’s voice as pitchman. The sheer crassness led to instant condemnation on social media, including speculation about what might be next — maybe trotting out James Baldwin to hawk “The Firestone Next Time”? Critics were hardly mollified by word that Ram had the blessing of Intellectual Properties Management, the licenser of Dr. King’s estate. The estate has not always been his staunchest guardian against posthumous commercialization. It might serve history a tad more faithfully to note other appeals that Dr. King made in that Feb. 4, 1968, sermon. For one thing, he was appalled by the way many people went into hock to buy vehicles they couldn’t possibly afford: “So often, haven’t you seen people making $5,000 a year and driving a car that cost 6,000? And they wonder why their ends never meet.” While we’re at it, he also didn’t think highly of advertising gurus — “you know, those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion.” He continued: “They have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you into buying. In order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car. In order to be lovely to love, you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume. And you know, before you know it, you’re just buying that stuff.” For that matter, Dr. King might well have been talking about a president a half-century in the future when he expounded on the need to rein in the drum major instinct, for otherwise it becomes “very dangerous” and “pernicious.” “Have you ever heard people that, you know — and I’m sure you’ve met them — that really become sickening because they just sit up all the time talking about themselves?” he said. “And they just boast and boast and boast. And that’s the person who has not harnessed the drum major instinct.” In the sermon’s finale, Dr. King said that he thought about his own death and funeral. It led to these ringing words: “If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter.” He did not ask to be a huckster for a line of trucks.",3167

We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world.” Those two sentences were about all Mr. Trump devoted to his energy policy in his message. Brief as they were, they encapsulated nearly everything that is shallow, dishonest and just plain wrong with that policy, as well as his approach to environmental issues generally. Here’s what’s deceptive: There has been no war on energy. American oil, gas and renewables like wind and solar flourished under President Obama. Coal was the exception, but Mr. Obama was not its enemy; the market was. “Beautiful, clean coal,” meanwhile, remains a mirage, at least for now; the affordable technology isn’t there. And the United States has always exported energy. In recent years — the Obama years — the amount of energy the country has sent abroad has begun to catch up with the energy it brings in. Mr. Trump’s false narrative on coal is particularly cruel, since it offers empty promises to Appalachian coal miners who are suffering grievous job losses and myriad health and economic ills. It’s true that the last two Democratic presidents — Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama — cracked down on power plant emissions like soot and mercury with rules that imposed real costs on producers; and Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan, aimed at cutting the carbon emissions that fuel global warming, would have pressured the industry more. But these regulations did not kill coal-fired plants, and rolling them back, as Mr. Trump is doing, will not stop the unforgiving forces of the market, chiefly the switch to cheaper natural gas, and renewables’ increasing competitiveness. These are the forces that have been largely responsible for the decline in mining jobs and the closing, or conversion to natural gas, of hundreds of coal-fired plants. What miners need are real programs to help transition them to new jobs, not promises of “beautiful, clean coal.” That, incidentally, is not a new promise. Clean coal technology involves turning coal into a gas, then stripping out the carbon dioxide and burying it so it cannot pollute the atmosphere. Many environmental groups (and this board) hoped it would work. It hasn’t. In 2015, the Obama administration finally pulled the plug on a clean coal experiment called FutureGen; then the Southern Company gave up on a clean coal venture in Mississippi after spending billions of dollars. America’s leverage in world markets has indeed improved, due largely to a spectacular surge in domestic oil and gas production from big shale deposits in Texas and North Dakota. Domestic production recently hit 10 million barrels of crude oil a day, a figure not seen since 1970. Oil imports have steadily dropped. This has helped change the old dynamic in which the United States was forced to rely too heavily on unstable parts of the world for its oil supply. All this production, however, has a dark side, rarely mentioned in the huzzahs about the 10-million-barrel milestone: the continued carbon-loading of the atmosphere as global temperatures rise, as one extreme weather event follows another, as almost all mainstream scientists say that to avoid a climate catastrophe, the world must leave a big chunk of its fossil fuels in the ground and spend heavily on more benign forms of energy. That is one reason Mr. Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, did not approve the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada’s oil sands. Such concerns are nowhere to be found in the playbook of a man who says that climate change is a hoax. Hence, full speed ahead, at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, with Mr. Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda, and with the overturning of rules that seek to balance conservation and commercial exploitation, and the opening up of nearly all of America’s offshore waters to drilling — whatever the risk, and however small the need.",4012

When Hitler’s Germany imperiled Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union set aside mutual hostility to defeat the Nazis. So is it too much to ask the mayor of New York City and the governor of New York State to work together in the face of a crisis bordering on the existential for their citizens? This is about fixing the doddering subways. Should they collapse, which on any given day does not seem a preposterous thought, the city would come treacherously close to having to put up a “going out of business” sign. The state might as well then summon the clergy to perform last rites on its own economy. But instead of desperately needed unity, we have two leaders and their surrogates engaged in a fruitless back and forth over who is historically responsible, who owes how much money, and who got us into this mess. Warring between mayors and governors is as natural in New York as jaywalking. But the tough-guy act performed, each in his own way, by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio is singularly corrosive because the welfare of nearly six million daily subway riders is at stake. It is shocking how little progress on bridging differences has been made since the governor declared a state of emergency seven months ago. It feels like “Groundhog Day,” only far less entertaining, with the same points made over and over. Each side seeks to bolster its case by hauling out documents so old and long-ignored that they are about as relevant to this emergency as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Each also has a knack for getting under the other’s skin, needlessly so. Mr. de Blasio’s representatives stopped the M.T.A. board from approving, for now, a billion-dollar plan to spruce up 33 subway stations with countdown clocks, better lighting and other amenities. Frills, the mayor implied. Spoken like someone who doesn’t appreciate how tired riders are of stations that look like the ruins of Stalingrad. For his part, Mr. Cuomo has elbows sharper than Freddy Krueger fingers, and he keeps swinging them. He proposed creating special tax districts in neighborhoods where property values go up because of new transit projects like the Second Avenue subway. The goal would be to “capture” increased property tax revenue to benefit the M.T.A. The concept is not without merit: If real estate is worth more because a subway is nearby, why not peel off some of the wealth to keep the rails in shape? But in typical fashion, the governor went off on his own, suggesting this without first clueing in the mayor and his aides, who need that same revenue for their own budget. Naturally, they pushed back. Ultimately, it is the governor who bears responsibility for the transit system and its governing board, which for too long sat by while money dribbled wastefully away. That was underlined by a recent Times series showing, for example, how a single mile of new track cost seven times the global average. How do we know Mr. Cuomo is where the buck stops? Because he said so himself, pointing to No. 1 when he asked, “You know who runs the M.T.A.?” That was at the end of 2016, when he basked in the limelight as the man officially opening brand-new Second Avenue subway stations. But Mr. de Blasio has an important role to play as well. It is past time for the two of them, governor and mayor, to get it together on transit. They managed a united front in reassuring New Yorkers after a truck attack in October killed eight people in Manhattan. Really, gentlemen, will nothing short of a terrorist act get you to find common ground?",3725

Mr. Trump promised to address these vexing issues last year, too, but made almost no progress. Perhaps this year he will take them seriously because he and his party want to impress voters ahead of the November elections. If so, there are many good ideas the White House and Congress ought to consider. The Opioid Crisis This is a daunting epidemic that has steadily gotten worse. Drug overdose deaths nearly doubled in 10 years, to more than 64,000 in 2016, a large majority of them from heroin and other opioids. “My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt,” Mr. Trump said in his State of the Union address. “The struggle will be long, and it will be difficult — but, as Americans always do, in the end, we will succeed, we will prevail.” Mr. Trump doesn’t have to look far to figure out what has to be done. His Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis released a detailed report in November on this very issue. One recommendation was for the government to increase access to substance abuse treatment. The administration could do so by demanding that health insurance companies cover such care. Federal law already requires insurers to cover addiction treatment and other mental health services, but many do not include those services in their networks of doctors and hospitals, according to a recent report. The commission said the administration and Congress should give the Department of Labor the authority to penalize insurance companies that do not adequately cover addiction treatment. The president should also ask Congress to dedicate more money for treatment. But that’s unlikely since the White House is reportedly considering slashing the budget of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which coordinates the federal government’s activities in this area. The commission also called on the government and insurers to encourage greater use of opioid alternatives like physical therapy and nonaddictive painkillers. Some doctors and hospitals have been moving in this direction. But experts say many health care providers are still prescribing opioids when they ought to be using alternative treatments. That’s because government programs and private insurers do not cover these alternative services and drugs. Other areas the government ought to focus on include cracking down on drug trafficking and the delivery of potent opioids, like fentanyl, through the postal system. But will Mr. Trump pursue any of these ideas? His record gives little cause for optimism. One indication of how seriously the White House has taken this issue was its appointment last month of a 24-year-old campaign volunteer with no experience in drug policy as the deputy chief of staff of the drug policy office. Outrage followed, and his tenure was cut mercifully short. Fixing Infrastructure Most Americans agree that the United States needs to substantially increase investments in transportation, energy, water and other public works. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the country needs to increase infrastructure spending by $2 trillion to be globally competitive. In his State of the Union speech, Mr. Trump said he wanted to increase investment by $1.5 trillion. But leaked copies of the administration’s infrastructure proposal show that it will include only $200 billion in federal spending. And White House officials have said that this money could come from cutting existing infrastructure spending on things like public transit and Amtrak. There is no dearth of important public works projects that could benefit from federal investment. At the top of the list is the plan to build new rail tunnels under the Hudson River. Known as the Gateway Program, this project would greatly expand capacity for commuter and long-distance trains on the East Coast. Highways, bridges and transit systems across the country desperately require repairs and upgrades to meet current and future needs. The lead crisis in Flint, Mich., has highlighted the sad state of water utilities. Some Republican lawmakers are already arguing that the government cannot afford a big infrastructure package. It’s strange to hear them say that after they just passed a huge tax cut that will raise the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over a decade. Congress could easily come up with money for transportation. Here are two suggestions: Raise the federal gas tax, which lawmakers last increased in 1993. Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports raising this tax. Or Congress could enact a carbon tax, which would have the added benefit of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Administration officials appear to think they can fix America’s infrastructure by giving developers tax incentives, moving some money around and eliminating environmental regulations, a favorite target for Mr. Trump and his cronies. These changes, they argue, will be enough to encourage the private sector and state and local governments to do what needs to be done. This is not credible because many states and cities will find it impossible to raise revenue after the Republican tax cuts reduce the deductibility of state and local taxes on federal tax returns. As for the private sector, it’s only likely to invest in projects that come with a lucrative stream of revenue, like toll roads, which have not proved as successful as their promoters had hoped. Mr. Trump has an opportunity to save and improve the lives of millions of people if he puts in place plans to end the opioid epidemic and upgrade the country’s infrastructure. He needs to start taking action, instead of talking about it.",5887
5a760dbed4211f00015bf252,2018-02-03T19:30:01+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/americas-last-slave-ship-and-slaverys-stain.html,Editorial,"The crime of importing enslaved people into the United States had been a federal offense for more than 50 years and was punishable by death when, on the eve of the Civil War, the Alabama businessman Timothy Meaher bragged that he could sail “a shipful of niggers right into Mobile Bay under the officers’ noses.” This threat reflected the Southern aristocracy’s fervent belief that it had a divine right to enslaved African labor. Meaher made good on his word in July 1860, when the schooner Clotilda — widely thought to be the last ship to bring human cargo into this country — stole into the bay after dark carrying 110 captive Africans in its filthy, disease-ridden hold. The men, women and children were removed from the ship and concealed until many of them could be sold. But even empty, the pestilent, waste-fouled enclosure where the Africans had spent the Atlantic crossing offered clear evidence that the Clotilda had been used in a capital offense — the crime of slave trading. Meaher planned to expunge this guilty evidence by giving the schooner a new name and refitting it. When that plan fell through, he and his confederates settled for burning the Clotilda in the waters of the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta, a few miles north of Mobile. Explorers have searched for the wreckage off and on for years. Finally, last month, Ben Raines — a reporter for the website AL.com — exploited a period of abnormally low tides to search out the charred remains of a schooner whose dimensions and design match those constructed in the mid-19th century, when the Clotilda was built. The wreckage — yet to be excavated and formally verified — has galvanized historians and reawakened the pain of enslavement among African-American descendants of the Clotilda captives, some of whom still live in what is called Africatown, a community not far from downtown Mobile that was founded by their forebears. This sudden rush of emotion underscores yet again the continuing impact of slavery on contemporary American life. To find the wreckage, Mr. Raines relied partly on new information gleaned from a local man who had seen it as a child, but also acknowledges a debt to the historian Sylviane Diouf, whose book “Dreams of Africa in Alabama: The Slave Ship Clotilda and the Story of the Last Africans Brought to America” offered clues as to the whereabouts of the wreckage as it documented the lives of the Clotilda Africans during enslavement and after Emancipation. The Clotilda captives had come from an area in West Africa where enslaved people could rise to influential positions in society once they became free. That experience would have left them utterly unprepared for a life in which slave status was inherited, based on ethnicity and punishingly cruel. The captives clung to African identities in the face of a system that was intended to erase them. They became a force to be reckoned with in plantation life by remaining united and showing that they would use violence to protect themselves. In one particularly vivid instance, they pounced on an overseer who tried to whip an African woman, lashing him instead, bringing such predations to an end. After Emancipation, the Clotilda Africans wanted more than anything to return home. But once they realized that they would probably live out their days in the United States, they took the brave step of petitioning Meaher for land, arguing that he owed them compensation for the free labor they had provided during bondage. Not surprisingly, Meaher refused. But the fact that the Africans pursued redress at all is remarkable, given that black men and women in the 19th century could be killed for even talking back to whites. Denied passage home, the Clotilda captives recreated Africa adjacent to the delta, scrimping and saving to buy property in the community they proudly named “African Town.” This refuge — from both white and black Americans — made it easier for them to embrace the West African culture and African languages that families continued to speak into 20th century. As they related the story of their captivity to their children, the Africans would no doubt have pointed to the charred hull of the Clotilda; it remained visible at low tide for several decades until the parts of the ship exposed to weather rotted away. If the newly discovered wreck is indeed America’s last slave ship, artifacts from the site could well open a window onto horrors the captives suffered during the crossing. But even in the absence of new information, the intense emotion that has welled up around this story underscores the extent to which the United States is still haunted by its original sin.",4653

But the damage to the federal tax credit program that finances nearly all affordable housing built in America is already painfully evident. Unless Congress rescues this crucial program, a quarter million fewer affordable units will be built over the next 10 years, deepening an already serious crisis. The federal low-income housing tax credit, created in 1986, allows companies to reduce their tax liabilities by investing in housing for some of the nation’s neediest families and individuals, many of them seniors, veterans and people with disabilities. The program has produced roughly three million rental units since its inception, but has fallen far short of the growing demand for affordable housing. For example, a 2017 report from Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies shows that about 11 million families — or about a quarter of all renters in the United States — spend more than half of their incomes on housing. These families often have to choose between making rent and paying for essentials like food, child care and health care, and many are just one financial emergency away from eviction. The pressure on low-income renters has worsened for other reasons as well. In recent years, higher-income people who once would have bought homes have turned to renting, driving up housing costs for poor and working-class families. The declining value of low-income housing tax credits will make all of this worse. It started last year, when President Trump and congressional Republicans made clear that they intended to dramatically lower the corporate tax rate, giving companies less reason to worry about tax liabilities. The impact of lowering the corporate tax rate was especially evident in expensive housing markets like San Francisco. As The Times reported last month, city officials had to plug a financial hole left by the devaluation of tax credits, the decline of which has increased the costs of building affordable housing by about $50,000 per unit. This problem will only get worse if Congress fails to act. An analysis by the accounting firm Novogradac & Company shows that, without remedial action, the new tax law will cut affordable housing by 235,000 units over the next 10 years and cost the country 260,000 jobs. Bipartisan bills in the House and the Senate would bolster the tax credit program. But the Senate bill is the stronger of the two. By increasing the number of housing credits by half — and making several common-sense regulatory changes — the bill would create more than 400,000 affordable units than would otherwise be possible. The bill has broad support. But there is a clear danger of it falling through the cracks as Congress makes its way toward a messy budget agreement. That would be the wrong outcome for needy Americans and the country as a whole.",2908

The four-page memo that promised to reveal the biggest political scandal in a generation has finally been released. For all the pregame hype, the memo looks less like the next Watergate and more like the next “unmasking”-gate, the 2017 pseudo-scandal that alleged — wrongly — that Obama administration officials had mishandled classified information. That dust-up was orchestrated, coincidentally, by Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who heads the House Intelligence Committee and whose staff prepared the document released on Friday. The memo opens darkly, raising “concerns with the legitimacy and legality” of Justice Department and F.B.I. interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. What sort of illegality are they talking about? The memo doesn’t say. Its central assertion appears to be that investigators who sought and received a warrant from the intelligence court to surveil the Trump campaign adviser Carter Page misled the court by failing to reveal the biased evidence they were relying on. First, they included in their warrant application a dossier prepared by Christopher Steele, a former British spy, without telling the court that Mr. Steele’s research was partly funded by the Clinton campaign. Second, they did not reveal that Mr. Steele had told a Justice Department official that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.” The memo also notes that Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I. who stepped down this week, testified to the Intelligence Committee in December that investigators would not have sought the warrant without the information contained in the dossier. This is all potentially interesting information. How significant is it in context? For starters, what other evidence did the intelligence court rely on in finding probable cause to issue the warrant? The memo doesn’t say. What about the court’s rationale for issuing three separate extensions, each of which required investigators to present new evidence beyond the dossier? The memo doesn’t say. Was any significant piece of information in the dossier found to be inaccurate? The memo doesn’t say. Did the court assume bias on the part of Mr. Steele or the funders of his research, as courts regularly do when considering evidence supporting a request for a warrant? The memo doesn’t say. You know what would help to answer questions like these? Even more transparency. It would be useful, for instance, if we could see all of the supporting evidence in the warrant application — with necessary redactions, of course, to protect sources and methods. Also helpful would be the 10-page response memo prepared by Representative Adam Schiff, the committee’s ranking Democrat, who, unlike Mr. Nunes, has actually seen the intelligence underlying the application. (The response memo reportedly explains, among other things, that investigators did in fact tell the court that the dossier was politically motivated.) Surely Mr. Nunes, House Speaker Paul Ryan and the other Republicans who, in the days leading up to the memo’s release, expressed a newfound enthusiasm for transparency in government would support releasing this information, wouldn’t they? Transparency in government is the lifeblood of a democracy, after all — the bulwark against abuses of power by public officials. As Mr. Ryan said on Tuesday in defending the House’s decision to release the memo, “Transparency can reign supreme.” Since the Republicans are now on board with greater transparency, they will no doubt push President Trump to release his tax returns, as every other major-party presidential nominee has done for the past four decades, won’t they? How about the White House visitor logs, which the Trump administration started hiding from the public last year? Or, say, the names of all foreign governments and officials who have stayed — at their own or at American taxpayers’ expense — at Mr. Trump’s Washington hotel, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida or at his golf courses and his other businesses since he became president? Or the names of every foreign business with which the Trump Organization has a financial relationship, especially in countries where America has sensitive foreign policy interests, like China, India, Russia, Turkey or Saudi Arabia? And, of course, Americans should have complete confidence now that congressional Republicans will demand complete transparency from all members of the president’s campaign, transition team and administration in describing their dealings with representatives of a foreign power that tried to swing our election — as well as from the special counsel who is investigating those efforts. The party that demanded the release of Hillary Clinton’s emails as a central plank of the 2016 presidential campaign must support all of this and more, right?",4920

It’s hard to see what the opposition leader, Raila Odinga, hopes to achieve with his faux inauguration as the “people’s president,” or what President Uhuru Kenyatta plans to do next now that he has outlawed Mr. Odinga’s National Resistance Movement. The space for a democratic resolution of the crisis has grown mighty thin, but the alternative could be disastrous. The spiral began with a presidential election in August, which President Kenyatta seemed to win handily. Mr. Odinga challenged the vote, and to general surprise the seven-judge Supreme Court agreed and ordered another election within 60 days. It was not to be. The ruling party passed amendments to the election law that made it all but impossible to challenge future results. Then the same Supreme Court, asked this time to postpone the do-over vote, suddenly couldn’t round up more than two judges, short of a quorum. Mr. Odinga boycotted the vote and threatened to hold a swearing-in ceremony as “peoples’ president”; Mr. Kenyatta threatened to block it. The “inauguration,” in effect a giant opposition rally, finally did take place in Nairobi on Tuesday. But the government declared the National Resistance Movement, the name the opposition adopted after the boycotted second election, a criminal group. What intensifies the feud is the fact that elections in Kenya are a fierce struggle for power and spoils between parties often organized along ethnic lines. Mr. Kenyatta is Kikuyu, and his deputy, William Ruto, is Kalenjin; the two groups have held the presidency since independence in 1963. Mr. Odinga is Luo; when he was seemingly robbed of a victory in 2007, two months of lethal violence erupted, ending with the creation of a coalition government. That could happen again, but both sides need to step back before it’s too late. Business and civil society leaders and international diplomats must use whatever leverage they have to press both sides for restraint and some sign of a willingness to talk and compromise.",2138

In a demonstration of unbridled self-interest and bottomless bad faith, the Trump White House and its Republican minions in Congress are on the cusp of releasing a “memo” that purports to document the biggest political scandal since Watergate. To pull it off, they are undermining the credibility of the law enforcement community that Republicans once defended so ardently, on the noble-sounding claim that the American public must know the truth. Don’t fall for it. Reports suggest that the three-and-a-half-page document — produced by the staff of Representative Devin Nunes (R-White House), who somehow still leads the House Intelligence Committee despite his own record of shilling for President Trump, and who is supposed to be recused from these matters — has nothing to do with truth or accountability. Rather, it appears to be misleading propaganda from people who are terrified by the Russia investigation and determined to derail it by any means necessary. Mr. Nunes’s cut-and-paste job ostensibly shows that anti-Trump F.B.I. investigators conspired to trick a federal intelligence court into granting them a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, because of his Russian connections — in that way corrupting the entire Russia investigation from the start. How did the investigators manage this feat? By relying on a dossier prepared by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, but hiding from the court that Mr. Steele’s work was being funded by Democrats, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and thus was hopelessly biased. There’s so much deception and obfuscation going on here that it’s hard to know where to start. First, Mr. Nunes and his fellow Republicans have treated the dossier like the holy grail for the Russia investigation, but it didn’t reach the F.B.I. until the inquiry was already underway — prompted in mid-2016 by suspicious contacts between Russians and George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Mr. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying about those contacts and is now cooperating with the special counsel’s investigation. Second, the F.B.I. didn’t zero in on Mr. Page for the hell of it. He has been in the government’s sights since 2013, when investigators learned he was being targeted for recruitment by a Russian agent. To obtain a warrant to spy on someone like Mr. Page, an American citizen, investigators must show probable cause that he is working as a foreign intelligence agent. This would require reams of documentary and other evidence gathered over the years, of which the dossier would have been only one part. In addition, the 90-day warrant for Mr. Page has already been extended at least once, which means investigators had to show the intelligence court new information, beyond the dossier, justifying the basis of the original warrant. Third, even if Mr. Nunes shows that investigators did not tell the court who financed the dossier — which originated as a Republican-backed effort during the primaries — that is hardly a scandal. It’s not clear that the court, in Mr. Page’s case, relied on the dossier at all, but even if it did, courts rarely deny warrants on the grounds that an informant had some bias. They always assume some bias exists, as it frequently does, and then weigh the information in light of that assumption. Finally, the idea that investigators were out to fool a federal judge shows a profound ignorance of how the intelligence courts actually work, and of the degree of vetting that precedes every warrant application. As one former F.B.I. agent explained, a conspiracy to obtain a warrant based on bad information would have required the involvement of at least a dozen agents and prosecutors, a corrupt or incompetent federal judge and the director of the F.B.I. — all working in concert to undermine Donald Trump. You could call it all a wild-eyed conspiracy theory, only there’s no real theory behind it. Instead, there’s a mad scramble to set off this latest smoke bomb, despite pleas to not do so from, among other people, Mr. Trump’s handpicked F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray. After Mr. Wray and Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, failed to persuade the president’s chief of staff, John Kelly, to withhold the memo, the bureau released a highly unusual statement expressing “grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” That Mr. Nunes and the other Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee are happy to disregard this appeal shows how far down the rabbit hole they’ve gone. Mr. Nunes hasn’t even seen the classified documents underlying his memo, and has refused to show his work even to Republican senators. Is this the behavior of someone concerned with honesty, transparency and good government? None of this is to say the F.B.I. and the rest of the federal law enforcement apparatus should be immune from criticism or reform. They should be subject to regular oversight and searching scrutiny. But that isn’t why Mr. Nunes is pushing his dishonest memo. As Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday: “It’s not that the government is always right or always wrong about secrecy. It’s that Americans would be right to see this release as proof that selective classification is used more often to deceive them than to protect them.” It would be nice to treat Mr. Trump, Mr. Nunes and their cohort as the junior high school pranksters they resemble, but what they’re doing — cynically undermining the nation’s trust in law enforcement, fostering an environment of permanent suspicion and subterfuge — is far more dangerous. The question is whether there are any adults left in the G.O.P. The evidence so far is not encouraging, notwithstanding a sporadic furrowed brow in the Senate. At some level, one hopes, a sense of shame and responsibility to the republic will finally kick in. But that, too, is unlikely. Republicans from the top on down have made it clear, expressly or otherwise, that this is all about winning the political fight directly in front of them, the consequences — and the rest of America — be damned.",6233

The signs increasingly point to unilateral American military action. To which we say: Don’t. The references to North Korea in the address were worrying enough. Mr. Trump called the country’s leadership “depraved.” He trumpeted his “campaign of maximum pressure” to ensure that the North does not succeed in perfecting a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike the continental United States. He asserted that “past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.” He pledged, “I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.” Mr. Trump seemed to be building a case for war on emotional grounds, invoking the case of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who died last year after being detained by North Korea. “Tonight we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with total American resolve,” the president said. The Warmbier family was among the president’s guests in the gallery. To an extent, such words were in line with his history of bellicosity toward North Korea, whose nuclear program and brutal regime are indeed grave threats and demand an effective response. Last year he threatened to answer North Korean provocations with fire and fury “the likes of which this world has never seen before.” What made Mr. Trump’s latest comments most alarming was the context. They were delivered as South Korean efforts to dial down the tension with the North, through dialogue and joint participation in the Winter Olympics, appeared to be bearing fruit. And they came just after it was reported that the administration had abandoned a long-delayed plan to nominate a prominent Korea scholar, Victor Cha, as its ambassador to Seoul. Mr. Cha, a senior Asia adviser in the George W. Bush administration and now a Georgetown University professor, has the credentials and experience often lacking in administration nominees. He completed the vetting process required of potential senior government officials, and South Korea had agreed to his appointment. In the end, Mr. Cha was unceremoniously dumped because he voiced opposition to the administration’s threat to carry out a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea before it can build a nuclear-armed missile able to hit the United States. One can only read this as evidence that Mr. Trump and his inner circle don’t want people with contrary views to challenge them on the most consequential decision a president can make — sending Americans to war. Has Mr. Trump already made it? Mr. Cha took an extraordinary step by writing an opinion article for The Washington Post in which he described his objections to what’s being called the “bloody nose” strategy, a limited military strike on North Korean nuclear facilities that will supposedly persuade the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions. Mr. Cha noted the large number of Americans living in Japan and South Korea. He said a military strike on the North would be “putting at risk an American population the size of a medium-size U.S. city — Pittsburgh, say, or Cincinnati — on the assumption that a crazy and undeterrable dictator will be rationally cowed by a demonstration of U.S. kinetic power.” Such action would only delay, not end, North Korea’s program and would provoke Mr. Kim into a vengeful effort to sell nuclear technology to any “bad actors” who will buy it, Mr. Cha argued. Mr. Cha is no dove on North Korea. He supports tough sanctions; beefing up of missile defense systems, intelligence-sharing and strike capabilities with South Korea and Japan; and even a maritime coalition to intercept nuclear technology leaving North Korea. It’s also important to emphasize that neither he nor Mr. Trump mentioned diplomacy, despite assertions by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the administration is open to talks with North Korea, although under unrealistic preconditions. There are no easy or good options with North Korea. Enforcing economic sanctions and blocking deadly technology from entering or leaving North Korea are necessary parts of any reasonable strategy. But so is diplomacy, including negotiations. Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with military action and refusal to seriously pursue a diplomatic overture to North Korea are foolhardy, especially when South Korea is using North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics to defuse tensions and open up space for dialogue. The United States has been at war continuously since the attacks of Sept. 11 and now has just over 240,000 active-duty and reserve troops in at least 172 countries and territories. Enough.",4811

Now, American successes against the Islamic State are threatened by Turkish attacks on the Syrian Kurds. The clash, long feared, could provoke a wider war and a division of Syria into zones of influence. But stopping it would require a diplomatic commitment on all sides that has so far been lacking. The confrontation began last week when Turkish forces crossed the border into Syria and attacked Kurdish troops, who control the northwestern town of Afrin. Since then, events have escalated, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey threatening to take the fight to the Kurdish-controlled town of Manbij, where American Special Operations forces are based. He is also talking about expelling the Kurds and resettling the area with Syrian refugees. The Kurds, known as the People’s Protection Units, dominate the Syrian Democratic Forces, an umbrella organization that receives American training, weapons and air support. The Turks consider them terrorists, indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that has waged a separatist war in Turkey for more than 30 years. While the Syrian group plays down its ties to the organization in Turkey, and there are differences, links do exist. The two groups have common roots, but experts say the Syrian contingent has largely kept a 2012 promise not to provide material support to the Turkish Kurds, who are formally recognized as a terrorist group by the United States and Europe. Despite the complications of Americans working with one Kurdish group while another group waged an insurgency against a NATO ally, the decision made sense. Turkey was so focused on overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that it refused to help America fight ISIS. It left its border wide open, enabling foreign fighters to swell ISIS’ ranks. The Kurds, on the other hand, wanted to fight ISIS, which threatened their forces, and they were good at it. Still, the United States should have done more to prevent the two parties from going to war with each other even before the ISIS threat receded. Turkey had grown alarmed about American collaboration with Kurdish forces after 2012, when those forces created an autonomous semi-state in northeastern Syria. The Turks now want to prevent the Kurds from linking three enclaves along the border into a unified Kurdish region. They worry that such a consolidation will embolden Kurdish fighters in Syria to aid the Kurdish party within Turkey. Those fears are understandable, but Mr. Erdogan is making things worse by attacking the Kurds in Syria, which could provoke a surge of Kurdish nationalism in the region. The offensive is part of his long-planned strategy to rally domestic support ahead of the 2019 elections, which relies heavily on portraying the United States as an enemy. It began after the Pentagon revealed plans for a new American-backed, 30,000-member border force in Syria that Turkey views as an attempt to create an autonomous Kurdish enclave. When Turkey reacted angrily, the White House disavowed the plans and hinted it was easing support for the Kurds, but the Pentagon said a Kurdish-led force was still in the works. To placate Turkey, Washington gave a green light to its offensive against Afrin, claiming that the Kurds in that area were not American allies. But it warned against an incursion into Manbij, where the Turks could come into direct contact with American forces. Such mixed messages sow confusion and do little to prevent further conflict, reassure the Turks or support the Kurds. Under the authoritarian Mr. Erdogan, Turkey has become an unreliable ally that stokes anti-Americanism at home and draws closer to Russia. But, with a major economy, a large army and a vital military base at Incirlik, it needs to be drawn closer to the West, not jettisoned. Still, the administration needs the Kurds. Both the Trump and Obama administrations always assumed that if they gave Mr. Erdogan a free hand to wage war against the Kurds in Turkey, he would give America a free hand to work with the Kurds in Syria. That assumption was blindly optimistic, and it has left Washington with two allies at war — to the benefit of Mr. Assad and his enablers, Russia and Iran, as well as the remnants of the Islamic State. The United States and NATO need to push Mr. Erdogan to resume peace talks with Turkish Kurds that were suspended in 2015. The Turkish president needs to be assured that a semiautonomous region for Syrian Kurds, a long-marginalized minority, would not threaten his country and would not collude with the Turkish Kurds. Kurds need to agree to those terms, promise to observe human rights norms, allow non-Kurds to live in their region and accept that the region will not become an independent state. As the Turks and Kurds face off, Mr. Assad is pushing to reassert control over Syria, while Russia and Iran maneuver to ensure they will have a permanent presence and influence in the country. Meanwhile, despite its military commitment, the United States is shirking its responsibility for Syria’s political future. Syria’s long agony will never end as long as leaders who should see a value in fostering regional stability keep tearing the country apart.",5459

But the leaders of Michigan State University, where he worked, have yet to take full responsibility for their failures to protect those girls, or to even learn what went wrong and regain the trust of the public. To ensure real accountability, members of the university’s Board of Trustees, which picks the university’s president, oversees its administration and sets policy, should resign to make way for new leadership unencumbered by the Nassar scandal and the recent report by ESPN that the university concealed allegations of sexual violence by members of its prized football and basketball programs. If the trustees refuse to do so, Michigan’s governor, Rick Snyder, and its Legislature ought to remove them. For about two decades, university officials — administrators, coaches, trainers, even police officers — either dismissed or silenced Dr. Nassar’s victims, allowing him to abuse several generations of athletes at the university and U.S.A. Gymnastics. When one victim filed a complaint with M.S.U. in 2014, the inquiry said that the doctor’s action was medically appropriate. So officials continued to let him treat young women, even while the campus police followed up on the complaint. Separately, ESPN quoted a former sexual-assault counselor at Michigan State who described a pattern of disturbing behavior in which senior university officials hid information about sexual-assault complaints against student-athletes and protected them from punishment. What is particularly distressing about all of this is that Michigan State’s leaders seem to have learned little from the abysmal response by universities like Penn State and Baylor to reports of sexual abuse in sports programs. Its eight trustees stood behind its embattled president, Lou Anna Simon — who was aware of the 2014 complaint — until just before her resignation last week. She was embattled because she did not appear to take the Nassar scandal seriously and seemed callous toward the victims. Even her resignation letter struck a tone of defensiveness. “As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable,” she wrote. The board’s vice chairman, Joel Ferguson, defended Ms. Simon on a radio show last week by arguing, among other things, that she was a great fund-raiser and “there’s so many more things going on at the university than just this Nassar thing.” The university resisted commissioning an independent investigation and gave the public the impression that it had hired Patrick Fitzgerald, a respected former United States attorney, to run one. It turned out that Mr. Fitzgerald was representing, not investigating, the school. Belatedly, on Friday, the board said it would “bring in an independent third party to perform a top-to-bottom review of all our processes relating to health and safety.” But the term “health and safety” suggests that this inquiry may not be as comprehensive as the one Penn State commissioned from Louis Freeh, the former F.B.I. director, after the university failed to stop the abuse of boys by Jerry Sandusky, the assistant football coach. Michigan State’s board on Wednesday appointed John Engler, a former Republican governor, as interim president. Many faculty members and students, angered at not being consulted, opposed the move, and some disrupted a board meeting where the decision was made. The first thing the board ought to do is commission a thorough and impartial investigation by someone of Mr. Freeh’s stature. The university cannot outsource its responsibility to the state attorney general, the federal Department of Education and the National Collegiate Athletic Association — all of which have said they are investigating the university. While the state attorney general can bring criminal charges, and the Education Department and N.C.A.A. can demand policy changes, only Michigan State’s leaders can make far-reaching changes to the university’s culture and practices. University trustees, who are elected to staggered eight-year terms, have no credibility to help the university regain trust. Mr. Snyder could remove the trustees by conducting a public inquiry, while the Legislature could do so after impeachment proceedings. Both could take months. The two trustees who are up for re-election this year have said they will not run again, but all of them should leave. Many young Americans probably cannot remember a time when sports did not play an outsize role in campus life and university administration. But the federal and state governments created Michigan State, Penn State and other land grant universities more than a century ago to extend higher education to more Americans. Now more than ever, the leaders of these universities need to place that core mission at the top of their priority list, above winning championships and signing lucrative TV contracts.",4972
5a71f23dd4211f00015be5db,2018-01-30T23:45:32+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/opinion/editorials/trump-putin-trashing-democracy.html,Editorial,"On the same day it was reported that the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, had said he expected Russia to meddle in the 2018 midterm elections, the Trump administration failed to fulfill a congressional mandate to punish Russia for its meddling in the 2016 election. Both houses of Congress almost unanimously approved legislation last year requiring more sanctions against Russia, and those who do business with Russia, in response to the hacking and disinformation campaign with which American intelligence agencies say Moscow sought to swing the election to Donald Trump. But in an announcement Monday night, the administration ignored the law’s core intent. While the law has been in effect for six months, not one new sanction has been imposed even as Russia has continued to interfere in democratic institutions here and abroad. The law was forced on Mr. Trump because he not only refused to punish the Russians, he refused then and refuses now to even acknowledge the Russian role in this assault on the American democratic process. Heck, the head of Russian foreign intelligence met with administration officials outside Washington last week even though he is under sanctions, according to the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer. How does that happen? Under the law, Monday was the deadline for the administration to impose sanctions on companies doing business with Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors and produce a report on Russian oligarchs and senior political figures. In the case of sanctions that were supposed to be imposed for buying Russian weapons, the legislation does provide for exceptions, and the State Department said the administration would take no action because the law and the threat of sanctions itself had deterred countries from fulfilling billions of dollars worth of arms deals. But it gave no evidence that that was the case — except in a classified briefing for senators. So we are left wondering whether there is a valid reason for the decision or whether President Trump is brazenly refusing to carry out the law and is once again utterly disregarding the constitutional system. Not only would the president be sticking a thumb in Congress’s eye, it would be yet another pass to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, whose attempt to help elect Mr. Trump has been confirmed repeatedly by the intelligence community, even officials like Mr. Pompeo whom the president appointed. If the administration could not find reason for imposing those sanctions, the law provides other powers. In a letter last week to Mr. Trump, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland and other Democratic lawmakers urged the president to levy sanctions on Russia for cyberattacks in the United States and elsewhere. The oligarchs’ report was supposed to detail those people with close, and corrupt, ties to Mr. Putin. Instead, in a sign of how contemptuously it views the sanctions law, the administration made public a list of 96 Russian billionaires copied almost entirely from a 2017 Forbes article. But it did not punish any of them or the 114 political figures named. The list of oligarchs was intended to demonstrate the breadth of Mr. Putin’s crony network and the extent of their net worth, their assets and business relationships — information likely of keen interest to millions of Russians who are not part of the moneyed class. Some dissident Russians believe that exposing such corruption is one of the few ways in Mr. Putin’s autocratic country to fire up citizens and encourage them to lobby for political change. While Mr. Putin is the only viable candidate as he stands for re-election on March 18, there have been massive opposition rallies in recent days. The list names 96 oligarchs each worth more than $1 billion, as well as all 30 members of Mr. Putin’s cabinet and more than 40 of his other advisers. That the list is virtually identical to the one Forbes published is no coincidence. A State Department representative told BuzzFeed that was essentially where the names came from. So it lacks the carefully vetted details that would describe their corruption. In the weeks before the list was revealed, Russian tycoons, officials and their lawyers showed great anxiety over the contents. On Tuesday, while a Kremlin spokesman accused the Americans of putting together an enemies list, other powerful Russians scoffed at it. The bottom line: Mr. Trump has provided Mr. Putin with more reassurance that he has nothing to fear from the president of the United States as he undermines American democracy.",4532
5a71f17ed4211f00015be598,2018-01-30T22:02:36+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/opinion/editorials/donald-trump-sotu-boasting.html,Editorial,"There’s a level at which — when you consider that the president of the United States has cozied up to a foreign power that tampered with an American election, has repeatedly assaulted the country’s courts and its law enforcement and intelligence agencies, has defended neo-Nazis, has cried “fake news” while provably lying, and has been revealed so credibly to have paid off a porn star that it made news when his own wife chose to attend his biggest speech of the year — it’s hard to believe that the state of the union is strong. And yet it is indeed strong, as President Trump said Tuesday, if not for all the reasons or in all the ways he claimed. Every president has used the State of the Union address to tell his brand-building version of the national narrative, and Mr. Trump can’t be blamed for offering his own characteristically brazen interpretation. He declared “incredible progress” and “extraordinary success” and announced a “new American moment” in a speech that seemed to last an eternity. But he couldn’t sustain the optimistic tone promised in advance, lapsing back into dishonest invocations of a rising immigrant menace and internal terrorist threat in order to press his nativist ideas. Yet Mr. Trump was correct to take note of the continued strength of the American economic recovery. He was right to note that the unemployment rate has continued to drop, and that some big employers have been raising wages. That’s all good. It means that Mr. Trump has done nothing so far to derail the slow, steady recovery that began under Barack Obama nine years ago. If growth continues or accelerates under this president, he will eventually, like Mr. Obama and the Federal Reserve, deserve a lot of credit. Mr. Trump was also right to observe that stock indexes are at astonishing heights. Though that rally also began many years ago, he clearly deserves some credit. His administration, and the tax bill he signed (not a record cut, as he falsely claimed), have been great gifts to investors, albeit gifts charged to future generations in the form of debt. Mr. Trump deserved to take a bow for the degradation of the Islamic State — again, a result of wise continuity with the policy of the previous administration — and for tightening sanctions on North Korea. That’s progress, much as we might wish he’d refrain from bragging about the size of his nuclear button. Mr. Trump can’t be blamed for all the country’s woes. Yet after a year in office, he can now fairly be held accountable, together with the feckless and cynical congressional leadership, for making many of them worse. Despite promising a $1 trillion infrastructure plan a year ago, a phantom plan whose price tag he raised to $1.5 trillion on Tuesday, he has yet to do anything to fix rusting bridges and faltering rail lines. His tax plan will undermine local efforts to make improvements around the country. He has yet to take serious action to end the opioid crisis. (“We have to do something about it,” he said Tuesday night, rather pathetically.) He has rubbed raw the nation’s wounds of bigotry and sexism. Without study or discernment, he has stripped away regulations meant to restrain climate change and to protect consumers. He seems utterly indifferent to improving an education system that is the foundation of the global competitiveness he insists he cares so much about. He’s deepened America’s commitment to Afghanistan with no exit strategy, and he’s raised tensions in the Middle East to no clear end. By gratuitously alienating allies and upending trade deals, he has eased the way for China’s hegemony. On his watch, four months after a devastating hurricane, nearly half a million Puerto Ricans — American citizens — are still without electricity, a crisis that, before he mentioned it Tuesday night, Mr. Trump hadn’t addressed directly since November. America’s immigration system was a mess before Mr. Trump took office, but so far he has injected only poison and confusion into the work of rationalizing it. Many studies have shown that immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born Americans, and experts say the evidence doesn’t support any claim that undocumented immigrants commit a disproportionate amount of crime. But Mr. Trump again on Tuesday raised the specter of an immigrant crime rampage. He’s right that the gang MS-13 is a terrible scourge; he was deeply wrong to suggest it was somehow representative of immigration’s effects on the nation. Digging in on his maximalist demands for limiting legal immigration and dividing immigrant families, Mr. Trump said he would bring the immigration system into the 21st century. He’s actually trying to drag it back to a shameful, bigoted past. In the campaign, Mr. Trump promised a new kind of politics, a populist administration that would end corruption in the capital, crack down on Wall Street and deliver for Middle America. Instead, underneath distracting surface spectacles like his trolling on Twitter, he is delivering the most ruthless, conventionally conservative domestic policy in memory. Nowhere is this more evident than in the way he is packing the courts — including the Supreme Court — with far-right justices, taking advantage of the vacancies created by nihilistic Republican filibusters of Obama appointees. Washington is more paralyzed than ever by partisanship, and as for corruption — well, lobbyists can now do their deals in the bar of the Trump International Hotel. How, then, can we say with Donald Trump as president that the state of the union is strong? Here, Mr. Trump deserves much of the credit: So far, the reaction against his authoritarian impulses, assault on truth and cruelties great and petty has revealed abiding American strengths. Despite the strong economy, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of this presidency. Most Americans say immigrants strengthen the country, according to the Pew Research Center. A profound national reckoning is underway over the status and treatment of women. Voters have streamed to the polls in off-year elections, defying suppression efforts even in Alabama to register their revulsion at Trumpian politics. As a national party, the Democrats have yet to find a coherent, appealing voice with which to do more than rail against Mr. Trump and instead address the nation’s needs. But as Republican members of Congress, in disgust or despair, choose not to run again, first-time candidates, many of them women, are stepping forward at the grass roots across the United States. If not exactly “woke,” this country might certainly be described as awakening, with a shot at shedding the civic apathy that has afflicted it for far too long. It is with backhanded gratitude that we might all thank President Trump for that.",6767
5a71e9aad4211f00015be283,2018-01-30T01:09:42+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/opinion/jersey-murphy-climate-change.html,Editorial,"Given the Trump administration’s indifference to climate change, the task of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, has fallen largely to city and state governments. It is thus greatly encouraging that New Jersey, under its new governor, Phil Murphy, a Democrat, will join — more precisely, rejoin — the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a consortium of nine Eastern and New England states that has achieved substantial emissions reductions from large power plants since its start in 2009. Mr. Murphy chose Highlands, a borough on the Atlantic shore hit hard by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, to announce that he would sign an executive order renewing New Jersey’s participation in the consortium. His predecessor, Chris Christie, a Republican, pulled the state out of the agreement in 2011, claiming he was trying to protect New Jersey ratepayers. A more plausible explanation lay in his nascent presidential aspirations. Climate change had become an unpopular subject among Republicans, and big donors like the Koch brothers were threatening to pull the plug on any candidate who favored regulation of greenhouse gases. RGGI (pronounced “Reggie”) has, in fact, a Republican pedigree, dating back to 2003, when Gov. George Pataki of New York invited other Northeast governors to join a regional effort to reduce carbon emissions. What followed was a regionwide system that sets a declining cap on emissions from large power plants — about 170 in total — and requires individual power producers to buy permits from state governments to pollute. As the cap declines, the price of the permits rises, giving utilities an incentive to find cheaper ways to reduce emissions. According to various studies, power plant emissions have declined 40 percent since 2009, while the sale of the permits has raised $2.7 billion that’s been invested in efficiency measures and renewable energy. Some of these reductions would have occurred anyway as plants shifted from coal to cheaper, cleaner-burning natural gas, and the reductions are a small fraction of the total greenhouse gases generated in the nine-state region. Even so, it’s a well-designed program that will only get stronger; last August, the nine states agreed to reduce emissions a further 30 percent by 2030. A national program along similar lines passed the House in 2009 but never came to a vote in the Senate. There is one more thing Mr. Murphy can do to show that he’s bringing a new sensibility on energy and environmental matters to Trenton. That is to chart a sensible way forward for two New Jersey nuclear plants that keeps them alive for now but provides for the day when they become too old or costly. At issue are the Salem and Hope Creek generating stations. Their owner, Public Service Electric and Gas, is threatening to close them unless the Legislature provides a subsidy of $300 million a year. A bill to do exactly that came close to approval in the waning days of the Christie administration and is now in negotiations between the new governor and the State Senate. Nobody doubts the value of the two plants. Nuclear power is carbon-free, and thus vital to the fight against climate change. But simply throwing money at them is shortsighted. California, Illinois and New York have all faced the issue of aging, uneconomical nuclear plants and have devised creative solutions that would significantly ramp up investment in renewables like wind and solar so that when the plants do close, there are carbon-free sources to take their place — not to mention new jobs for the displaced workers. Mr. Murphy should insist on a similarly creative and comprehensive plan.",3656
5a71e9bcd4211f00015be289,2018-01-30T00:20:32+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/opinion/poland-holocaust-bill-parliament.html,Editorial,"It is baffling why Poland’s nationalist-controlled Parliament would mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day — the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi concentration camp on Polish soil — with a needless, foolish and insulting draft bill that would penalize any suggestion of complicity by the Polish state or the Polish nation in the Nazi death machine. Apart from raising the very questions about the role of the Poles in the Holocaust that the drafters apparently want to hide, are we not past such self-serving posturing over one of history’s greatest crimes? Whatever dubious motives are behind this measure, Poland would do well to erase it as quickly as possible. No doubt it pains Poles, whose country was overrun and occupied by Nazi Germany in World War II, when foreigners refer to Auschwitz and other extermination centers the Nazis set up in Poland as “Polish death camps.” They were Nazi death camps. Along with three million Polish Jews — about half of all Jews killed in the Holocaust — at least 1.9 million Polish gentiles were killed. Some Poles tried to help Jews and have been recognized as “righteous among nations.” Yet it is also undeniable that Poles were directly or indirectly complicit in the crimes committed on their land and that Poles were guilty of anti-Jewish pogroms during and after the war. These are the facts of that terrible history, and the Poles, like all other nations conquered by Germany that became embroiled in the Nazi atrocities, have an obligation to the victims and to the future to seek the full truth, however painful. Regardless how it is parsed, the Polish bill is a blatant and chilling effort by a nationalist government waging an offensive against the rule of law and freedom of expression to discourage that search. “Whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reich … shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years,” reads an article of the draft. But what constitutes an accusation? Who determines the facts? Who will risk three years in prison to seek the historical truth? The Polish government is not the first to try to shape the history to its advantage. The Soviet Union long preferred to refer broadly to “victims of fascism,” avoiding any specific reference to Jews, and Austria for years painted itself as the “Nazis’ first victim,” denying all responsibility for its crimes. Yet such thinking has largely been rejected for many years now. In a striking coincidence, the Polish bill was passed just as the leader of a major Muslim institution in Saudi Arabia, a sternly Islamic kingdom better known for its virulently anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli positions, publicly proclaimed the Holocaust “among the worst human atrocities ever.” “One would ask, who in his right mind would accept, sympathize or even diminish the extent of this brutal crime?” demanded Mohammad Alissa of the Muslim World League in a letter to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Indeed, that is the question Poland should be asking, and in fact many Poles have been asking and should be encouraged to keep asking.",3258

In pain, she rushed to a hospital near her house in Michigan. But because it was a Catholic health center, doctors there did not tell her that continuing her pregnancy could threaten her health and that abortion was her safest option. Instead they sent her home. They did so again when she returned the next day, bleeding, with painful contractions. They were preparing to send her home for a third time when she miscarried at the hospital. Cases like this, in which a provider’s religious beliefs take precedence over a patient’s needs, could become more common because of a series of recent White House decisions that please the anti-abortion movement. The decisions may make it more difficult for teenagers wanting to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases, for gay men looking  to prevent HIV and even for women seeking breast exams or pap smears. Earlier this month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced the creation of a “Conscience and Religious Freedom Division” to enforce laws protecting health care providers’ right to opt out of certain procedures, including post-abortion care or gender-affirming surgery, because of religious objections. (The website displays what appears to be a female Muslim doctor in a hijab smiling enthusiastically — a twist on the administration’s usual attitude toward Muslims.) The unveiling of the new office may simply be a signal to the conservative base, an elaborate way of saying, “We haven’t been able to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, but we still care.” But the administration also released a 216-page proposed rule detailing how the new division will double down on religious protections. Right now, state and federal laws already protect a nurse, for instance, who doesn’t want to assist with an abortion for religious reasons. But in a list of definitions, the administration would expand the meaning of “assisting” to include making referrals to a different provider, or even simply counseling a patient on her options. In the same list, the department broadly redefines “work force” so religious protections can apply not just to the nurse in the room, but also to the scheduler, the janitor and the security guard outside. “The definition of ‘to assist’ is unparalleled,” said Louise Melling, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It goes so far as to include someone objecting to checking you in, someone objecting to doing your insurance paperwork, someone objecting to even taking your temperature.” The regulations don’t recommend that doctors balance a patient’s needs with religious objections; religious objections are given top priority. The rule suggests that the office can investigate a health care entity not just based on actual complaints, but also based on “threatened” or “potential” ones. There could also be grim consequences from a one-page letter the administration sent to state Medicaid directors, suggesting that they may now block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood or other health centers that provide abortions. (Planned Parenthood says that more than half of its patients are covered by Medicaid.) The letter overturned a 2016 Obama-era directive that required states to distribute federal funds for family planning services, like contraception, prenatal care and testing for sexually transmitted diseases, to qualified health providers, regardless of whether those providers also perform abortions. Freedom of religion is essential — and so is access to health care. Current law tries to accommodate both, but the far right has stirred unfounded fears that religion (and Christianity in particular) is under assault, and that people of faith are in danger of being forced to do things they find morally objectionable. “Patient-centered care” is an important goal in clinical training today, but the administration is instead proposing provider-centered care. In recent conflicts between patient needs and religious freedom, patients have too often lost. The Trump administration wants to keep it that way.",4141

Mr. McConnell is set to hold a procedural vote this week on a bill that would ban abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy. The so-called Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, is part of a long-term legislative effort by the anti-abortion movement to gut Roe v. Wade and severely curtail abortion access nationwide. Twenty-week abortion bans, enacted in more than a dozen states and struck down in two, violate the Supreme Court’s standard that abortion can be restricted only when a fetus is viable outside the womb. Many, including the one being considered by the Senate, are based on claims not supported by most scientists about when a fetus feels pain. Only about 1 percent of women seeking abortions do so after 21 weeks, and they often make that decision because a fetal abnormality has been found or because their own health is in danger. Twenty-week bans particularly curb access for poor women, who often struggle to find the money and time for the procedure. The Senate bill contains exceptions for rape and incest if the women reported the abuse to law enforcement and sought counseling 48 hours before the abortion. But there is no exception to protect the health of the pregnant woman. Abortion providers, who already face harassment and threats to their lives and work, would face criminal penalties, with a sentence of up to five years, for performing abortions after 20 weeks. The locations of all such procedures would need to be reported to the federal government. Though President Trump urged Congress to “pass this important law and send it to my desk for signing” in his address to the anti-abortion March for Life this month, Republicans are almost certain to fall short of the 60 votes needed to formally take up the bill. Still, abortion rights advocates and medical professionals are taking the legislation seriously, since abortion foes are working hard for it. The prospects for such a ban considerably diminish if the Democrats take back either house of Congress after the 2018 midterm elections. And if they control the Senate, Mr. Trump will have virtually no chance of picking another anti-abortion Supreme Court justice. Since announcing his candidacy, Mr. Trump, at one time a supporter of abortion rights, has embraced anti-abortion politics with zeal. But that seems to be a matter of maintaining evangelical support. His concern for fetal life cannot be fairly measured, but his sensitivity to the needs of women, or lack of it, is well known. Some sponsors of the version of this bill that the House passed in October seem to share Mr. Trump’s attitude. One, Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, resigned his seat in December after it was reported that a female staff member had felt pressured to have sex with him as part of a surrogacy scheme. Another, Tim Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican, voted for the bill just hours after news broke that he was accused of pressuring his mistress to — get this — have an abortion. He later quit. Ultimately, the fate of the ban and other anti-abortion measures will be in the hands of voters. For supporters of abortion rights, the choice should be clear.",3402

A handful of prestigious law schools, for the first time this admissions cycle, are allowing applicants to submit GRE scores instead of LSAT scores. This issue's Pop Quiz: sample questions from both.
 Is the LSAT’s monopoly eroding? Last year, the University of Arizona law school became the first to allow applicants to submit general GRE scores as an alternative to taking the Law School Admission Test. Now, a handful of elite law schools — including Georgetown, Harvard, Columbia, Northwestern and Washington University in St. Louis — have announced they will do the same. A trickle, yes. But an elite one, and remember how the GRE began to encroach on the GMAT a decade ago? Now, 1,300 business schools accept it. “You’re going to see a few more schools announce, and then a blanket permission from the A.B.A., and then you’ll see a deluge,” predicted Mike Spivey, founding partner of the test prep company Spivey Consulting. “The GRE expands the applicant pool.” For one, it is offered far more often than the LSAT and can be used to apply to most graduate programs, not just law school, meaning only one test to prep for.  That broader access is what appeals. “We had been thinking for quite some time that the guardrails to get into the legal profession were a little narrow,” said Andrew Cornblatt, admissions dean for the Georgetown University Law Center. He's looking for a “better cross-section” of applicants, specifically in science, technology, engineering and math. He’s counting on the GRE's quantitative section to identify deductive thinkers — what most of the LSAT is aimed at, sans math. On Oct. 31, the Educational Testing Service, which develops the GRE, released a study attesting to the exam's ability to predict law school success. The American Bar Association isn't so sure. With the GRE making inroads, the A.B.A.'s accrediting arm is reviewing its testing standards. LSAT traditionalists argue that the GRE fails to target the analytic reasoning required of lawyers. Both companies provided us with questions they say illustrate how those skills are measured. Are you a logical thinker? Test yourself below. LSAT From the Analytic Reasoning section, a.k.a. the  (dreaded) “logic games”   Each of seven candidates for the position of judge — Hamadi, Kurtz, Jefferson, Li, McDonnell, Perkins, Ortiz — will be appointed to an open position on one of two courts: the appellate court or the trial court. There are three open positions on the appellate court and six openings on the trial court, but not all of them will be filled at this time. The judicial appointments will conform to the following conditions: Which one of the following is an acceptable set of appointments of candidates to courts? a.  Appellate: Hamadi, Ortiz. 
Trial: Jefferson, Kurtz, Li, McDonnell, Perkins. b.  Appellate: Hamadi, Li, Perkins. Trial: Jefferson, Kurtz, McDonnell, Ortiz. c.  Appellate: Kurtz, Li, Perkins.

From the LSAT's Logical Reasoning section The Naturalist: Different nonhuman primate species exhibit many contrasts in behavior. If a zookeeper leaves a screwdriver within reach of a chimpanzee, the animal is likely to examine and play with it for a time, and then move on to something else. In the same circumstances, an orangutan is likely to pretend to ignore the tool at first; later, in the zookeeper’s absence, the orangutan may use the screwdriver to try to dismantle its cage. Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the naturalist’s statements? a.  Orangutans are the most intelligent of nonhuman primates. b.  Orangutans have better memories than chimpanzees have. c.  Some nonhuman primates are capable of deception. d.  Orangutans dislike being caged more than chimpanzees do. e.  Not all nonhuman primates understand tool use. Joe: All vampire stories are based on an absurd set of premises. Since, according to such stories, every victim of a vampire becomes a vampire, and vampires have existed since ancient times and are immortal, vampires would by now have almost completely eliminated their prey. Maria: In most of the vampire stories I am familiar with, vampires turn only a few of their victims into vampires. The rest are permanently dead. Joe and Maria disagree over the truth of which one of the following? a.  Vampires are always depicted in vampire stories as immortal. b.  Vampires are always depicted in vampire stories as having existed since ancient times. c.  No vampire stories are incoherent. d.  No vampire stories depict the vampire population as being very large. e.  In all vampire stories, every victim of a vampire becomes a vampire. GRE From the Verbal Reasoning section Upon maturity, monarch butterflies travel hundreds of miles from their places of origin and lay their eggs on milkweed. The caterpillars that emerge feed on milkweed and absorb the glycosides in milkweed sap. The specific glycosides present in milkweed differ from region to region within the monarch butterfly’s range. Mature butterflies retain the glycosides they absorb as caterpillars. Clearly, therefore, the glycosides in a mature monarch butterfly could be used to determine its place of origin. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? a.  Mature monarch butterflies do not feed on parts of milkweed that contain glycosides. b.  The glycosides in milkweed sap are slightly toxic to caterpillars of other species. c.  The vast majority of the monarch butterflies that are laying eggs in a given region will have traveled there from a single region. d.  There are substances other than glycosides in milkweed sap that accumulate in a monarch caterpillar and are retained in the body of the mature butterfly. e.  There are certain glycosides that are found in the sap of all milkweeds, no matter where they grow within the monarch butterfly’s range. The demands of  notwithstanding, a page or two in Dahl’s recent book on democracy that considered what public-choice economics has to say about “democratic failure” — or at least a clear signpost to that literature — would have been very well spent.

An American history curriculum lets young people write the narrative. Fill in the rap.
 You can draw a direct line from the founding fathers to issues and concerns of today in these verses. In a curriculum created by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, students study how Lin-Manuel Miranda used primary source documents to write raps for his Broadway show on Alexander Hamilton. They then choose a founding-era person or event on which to base their own creation. One presentation from each participating school gets stage time before students attend a performance of the show. As the “Hamilton” national tour expands (next opening: Los Angeles on Aug. 11), so does the curriculum. The institute, which has been integrating history into classrooms for more than 20 years, expects its Hamilton Education Program to reach 250,000 public school students across the country. We created this issue’s Pop Quiz by excerpting snippets of student presentations and dropping out the key word(s). Fill in the blanks by clicking on one of the answer options, and watch a video of each performance.

 While Computer Science A is the fastest growing A.P. course, it doesn’t attract many girls or underrepresented minorities. So the College Board, at the urging of the National Science Foundation, has created a second course. Computer Science Principles is less coding heavy, more project-oriented and strives to be real-world relevant. The course was introduced this school year with 2,600 teachers, the largest A.P. launch by far. Demographics from the 2015-16 pilot courses were promising: 16 percent of students were African-American (compared with 4 percent in Computer Science A), 18 percent were Hispanic (9 percent in C.S.A.) and 28 percent were girls (22 percent in C.S.A.). 
Because teachers can choose the programming language of their choice, students taking the exam have access to a ""quick reference"" guide to commands. But we chose sample questions we thought even a coding virgin could answer.   The course was introduced this school year with 2,600 teachers, the largest A.P. launch by far.

Physical sensors are used to set the following Boolean variables. There are 32 students standing in a classroom. Two different algorithms are given for finding the average height of the students. ALGORITHM A Step 1: All students stand. Step 2: A randomly selected student writes his or her height on a card and is seated. Step 3: A randomly selected standing student adds his or her height to the value on the card, records the new value on the card, and is seated. The previous value on the card is erased. Step 4: Repeat step 3 until no students remain standing. Step 5: The sum on the card is divided by 32. The result is given to the teacher. ALGORITHM B Step 1: All students stand. Step 2: Each student is given a card and
writes his or her height on the card. Step 3: Standing students form random
pairs at the same time. Each pair adds the numbers written
on their cards and writes the result on
one student’s card; the other student is seated.

 I graduated from college nearly 25 years ago. Wondering if I’d be considered college-ready now, I arranged at a community college to take the Accuplacer, the test used to place students into remedial classes. I went in cold, no prep, years away from my last math class, the way many community college students do. Scoring below the college’s cutoff, I tested into remedial math. Would you? The Accuplacer is adaptive, and the difficulty of questions depends on how well, or how poorly, you do. You may get stuck in simple arithmetic or zip through to the advanced algebra and functions section. We can't replicate real test conditions, so try these practice questions from the newly revised test just for fun — yes, math can be fun.

We constantly keep track of the time. When is that appointment? When are the kids due home? But even as we attend to it, time surprises us. It stretches adolescence to an agonizing length yet carries us to midlife before we are ready. Time is strange and mysterious; seemingly obvious truths about it have been upended by scientific discoveries. Einstein showed that the speed at which time passes for us depends on how fast we are moving, and psychologists have found that we are subject to temporal illusions: If we are shown a sequence of images at an identical pace, an out-of-place image will seem to last longer. Some philosophers have even claimed that time does not exist. My classes explore questions raised by what scientists have learned about time. This quiz is drawn from that material.

 An earlier version of this quiz misstated the answer to No. 1. It is “restraining communist military power and ideological influence,” not “creating alliances with recently decolonized nations.” A Pop Quiz on Page 21 this weekend — practice questions from the Advanced Placement exam in United States history that the College Board revised after criticism — renders question No. 12 incorrectly.

It appears that history does indeed rhyme, as one famous Missourian, Mark Twain, is said to have quipped. Students are active again; protests have been ubiquitous as simmering grievances have kindled a crisis. But boycotts by athletes, building occupations and resignation demands — all to force change for students of color — are not new acts. This academic year, Black Lives Matter has found a place on campuses like the University of Missouri, Yale, Princeton and the historically black Howard University in the same way that the civil rights and black power movements once did. This timeline is hardly exhaustive, but it provides some linear and ideological connections between the current campaigns and those of the past.

 A new wave of international student activism has targeted names, mascots, statues and other symbols of historical figures at colleges and universities. Activists argue that the symbols should be removed as offensive reminders of hatred and violence. Many school officials acknowledge the historical complexities, but they argue that a better approach would be to teach students about the morally questionable acts of the past. Still others defend the symbols as harmless traditions. In August, the University of Texas at Austin took down a larger-than-life bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, that had stood on campus since 1933, and relocated a statue of Woodrow Wilson. The decision came after an unsuccessful challenge to keep the statue, by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The university was responding in part to the massacre of black churchgoers in South Carolina in June by a white gunman. In 2003, Ruth Simmons, the first black woman to lead an Ivy League university, commissioned a study of Brown University’s historical links to the slave trade. Slaves accounted for 10 percent of Rhode Island’s population in 1764, when Brown was founded, and the state was a northern hub of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The study, completed in 2006, did not urge renaming the school, but it undertook a number of initiatives to promote social justice and instill a deeper understanding of its troubled origins. The initiative led to similar inquiries at Harvard, William & Mary, Princeton and Columbia. In November 2015, Martha L. Minow, dean of Harvard Law School, convened a committee to reconsider the school’s controversial seal — the crest of the slaveholding Royall family, which endowed the law school’s first professorship, in the 19th century. The school’s seal, according to The Harvard Crimson, shows three sheaves of wheat under an emblem of “Veritas.” Students at the school had already expressed alarm after pieces of black tape were placed across contemporary portraits of black law professors at Harvard, an act that was widely interpreted as one of vandalism. On Jan. 26, Amherst College, a prestigious liberal-arts school in New England, announced that Lord Jeffery Amherst, the 18th-century colonial governor after whom the town of Amherst, Mass., where the college is based, is named, would no longer be the unofficial campus mascot.   A commander who led crucial British victories in the French and Indian War, Lord Jeffery advocated that Native Americans be given smallpox-infected blankets to hasten their demise.  The college’s trustees said it would no longer use any references to Lord Jeffery in official communications or symbolism, and that it would find a new name for the Lord Jeffery Inn, a campus hotel owned by the college. The trustees also said that a group made up mostly of alumni and students would consider whether Amherst should adopt a new, and official, mascot. Last summer, Yale Law School students began a petition to rename Calhoun College, one of Yale University’s 12 undergraduate residential colleges. A senator from South Carolina who died in 1850, John C. Calhoun was one of the most ardent white segregationists of antebellum America, providing much of the intellectual and political support for the nullification of antislavery legislation and the ultimate secession of Southern states, which began the Civil War, the deadliest in the history of the United States. Amid an uproar last fall about mistreatment of black students at Yale, the university’s president, Peter Salovey, pledged that the university’s governing body would examine the Calhoun issue. Jonathan Holloway, the dean of Yale College, who is also a black historian and the former master of Calhoun College, said he was torn about the issue.  In August, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, removed the name of William L. Saunders — a historian, lawyer, newspaper editor, Ku Klux Klan leader and North Carolina secretary of state — from a building that had bore his name since 1922. The building was renamed Carolina Hall.  On the same campus, a statue of “Silent Sam,” an anonymous Confederate soldier, was erected in 1913 to honor 321 alumni who died in the American Civil War. It has been vandalized several times. In March 2015, a student movement emerged to remove a bronze 1934 statue of Cecil Rhodes, the British imperialist and an architect of the apartheid system in South Africa. The statue was taken down the next month. But the activist movement turned into a nationwide campaign to “decolonize” education in South Africa, where racial inequalities persist two decades after the end of apartheid.  In November, inspired by the success of the movement at the University of Cape Town, Ntokozo Qwabe, a black South African Rhodes scholar at the University of Oxford, and other students began a petition to remove a statue of Rhodes from Oriel College, Rhodes’s alma mater and one of the university’s 38 largely self-governing colleges. Oriel agreed to remove a plaque under the statue. In January 2016, the college announced that the statue would remain, but that it would “seek to provide a clear historical context to explain why it is there.”  President Woodrow Wilson, who led the United States during World War I, won the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for his work setting up the League of Nations and supporting multilateral approaches to prevent conflict. A Southern Democrat, he was also an ardent racist who intensified the segregation of the federal work force. Student activists have demanded that Princeton rename the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, which was founded in 1930 and renamed for the former president in 1948. The university’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, has agreed to start consultations on the issue.  Activists at the University of Missouri and the College of William & Mary have protested statues of Thomas Jefferson, the nation’s third president, who was a leading slaveholder and fathered several children with his mixed-race slave Sally Hemings (who was also a half-sister of Jefferson’s wife, Martha). They have called him a “racist rapist.”  The University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, which Jefferson founded and which opened in 1819, was troubled in recent years by controversies over sexual assaults of students. There has not been a prominent effort to strip the school of its many associations with Jefferson. Advertisement",6521

  Delve into the history of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the past looks an awful lot like the present. O’Bannon v. the N.C.A.A. weighed in on the testy debate over whether college athletes should share in the millions they generate. In August, Judge Claudia Wilken ruled that players should be compensated for use of their name or likeness. The N.C.A.A. has appealed, and more lawsuits are on the way. It’s no surprise — concerns about commercialism and amateurism have dogged big-time college sports from the start. For a quiz on teams in the N.C.A.A. Football Bowl Subdivision, click here.

Steven Pinker is every bit the populist. All but three of his nine books are aimed at the general public (“The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined” is available in 21 formats and editions; the CD comes out this week). Dr. Pinker’s teaching is similarly accessible. Just look at the test questions here, culled from one of his Harvard courses, “Psychological Science.” He explains his approach: “The questions that psychology tackles are the ones that obsess us in everyday life: family relations, sexuality, kindness and aggression, the reliability of knowledge. Not surprisingly, many concepts in academic psychology have crossed over into popular culture, such as conditioning, Freudian psychoanalysis and cognitive dissonance. Exams that invoke these memes test whether students understand the theories well enough to reason about them when they are presented away from a familiar textbook context and are applied to real life.”

This year is on track to be the third consecutive hottest year on record. Where does that heat go? The oceans, mostly.
 -2°C 0 +2  1900s  1910s  1920s  1930s  1940s  1950s  1960s  1970s  1980s  1990s  2000s  2010s Average temperatures from each decade compared with the 20th-century average. Ocean temperatures have been consistently rising for at least three decades. Scientists believe that global sea surface temperatures will continue to increase over the next decade as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere. According to a report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature released last week, the Southern Hemisphere has experienced intense warming over the past decade, with strong heat accumulation in the midlatitude regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Natural patterns such as El Niño and La Niña can have year-to-year effects on temperatures. Individual storms can also influence ocean temperatures for months or longer. But the overall temperature trends by decade reveal a backdrop of human-caused warming. Record High Annual Mean Surface Temperatures, 2015 Last year, nearly all observed ocean surface temperatures registered above average because naturally occurring conditions caused by El Niño combined with human-induced warming. About a quarter of those observations broke record highs. Since 1955, more than 90 percent of the excess heat retained by the Earth as a result of increased greenhouse gases has been absorbed by the oceans, leaving ocean scientists like Eric Leuliette at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration feeling that 90 percent of the climate change story is being ignored.

According to Gregory Johnson, an oceanographer at NOAA, the rate of energy gained between 1971 and 2010 was roughly equal to the power required to run 140 billion 1,500-watt hair dryers over the same number of years. The rate has only increased in the past decade. This excess energy has largely been sucked up by the oceans, which have a huge capacity to store heat. As the oceans store more heat, however, they expand. Scientists have shown that over the past decade, this thermal expansion has caused about one-third of the rise in sea levels. The oceans act as Earth’s enormous heat sponge, sheltering continents and the people who live on them from atmospheric extremes. The near-surface ocean takes only decades to warm in response to elevated greenhouse gas concentrations, but the deep ocean will take centuries to millenniums, raising sea level all the while. In the meantime, warmer ocean temperatures may also increase the destructive potential of extreme weather, like cyclones and hurricanes. In fact, the effects of warmer waters are already widespread. Ice Melt and Sea Level Rise The Greenland ice sheet is studded with meltwater streams, rivers and lakes. The rate of melt is alarming many scientists. Both ice melt and thermal expansion are causing a significant rise in global sea levels. Marine Species Are at Risk Warmer temperatures are threatening some marine animal and plant species, like these bleached coral on the Great Barrier Reef. Scientists also predict that some birds, like the black-legged kittiwakes in Norway, may soon die off in warmer waters. Habitats Are Changing The warmer conditions have allowed some jellyfish, like the comb jellyfish, pictured above, in Narragansett Bay, to have longer seasons. Others have expanded their territory. In some cases, United States fisheries have shifted north to cooler waters.

The depressed price of oil has been wreaking havoc on the industry to the point of making it unprofitable to drill for oil in the United States and even undermining countries whose economies are heavily dependent on exporting oil, like Russia, Venezuela and Nigeria.

After rising earlier this year, crude is back down to about $43 a barrel. Prices have fallen more than 60 percent in nearly two years. Prices tend to fluctuate in response to geopolitical and economic turmoil. Worries about China’s economic health has been one recent factor weighing on oil.

The low price of oil has cut the profits of United States oil companies, forcing many into bankruptcy. And a devastating forest fire in the oil sands region of Canada forced many companies to slow or stop altogether. For the first time in years North American production decreased, as more than 250,000 oil and gas workers have lost their jobs worldwide — over half of whom worked in the United States.

United States production surged in recent years with the shale boom, while major producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia have been pumping at high levels. This year, a balance has returned, but because demand is weak, it will take a while to work through the excess.

Sean Churchfield, operations manager for Shell Alaska and a member of the response team that includes representatives from Shell, the Coast Guard and Alaska’s environmental agency, said the rig was refloated late Sunday night and arrived in Kiliuda Bay, a sheltered area on Kodiak Island about 300 miles southwest of Anchorage, on Monday morning. The calmer waters will enable the rig, the Kulluk, to be inspected above and below the waterline. The next step depends on the extent of the damage; one possibility is that the rig would be towed to Seattle for repairs. The 266-foot-diameter Kulluk, one of two rigs that Shell is using in its ambitious effort to open Arctic waters to oil production, was en route to Seattle late last month when it ran aground on Sitkalidak Island after its tow ship lost power. The rig has no propulsion system. The Kulluk remained upright and stable during the six days it sat in 25 feet of water about 350 yards offshore, and there was no sign of leakage of any of the 150,000 gallons of fuel and lubricating oil aboard. The towing operation began Sunday afternoon, when salvage crews attached a line between the rig and its tow ship, the Aiviq. Then shortly after 10 p.m., near high tide, the Aiviq pulled the rig from the spot where it had been marooned. The Aiviq, accompanied by tugs, a Coast Guard ship and oil spill response vessels, towed the Kulluk about 50 miles north. The trip took 12 hours, Mr. Churchfield said. Monitoring equipment showed there was no discharge of pollutants from the rig during the tow, said Steven Russell of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, a member of the response team. Capt. Paul Mehler III of the Coast Guard, the head of the response team, said getting the Kulluk to safer waters was a major milestone. “I wouldn’t say I saw anyone high-fiving,” said Captain Mehler, who was nearby aboard a Coast Guard ship when the Kulluk became unstuck. “But there certainly was a sense of relief.” After drilling test wells off the North Slope of Alaska in 2012, the Kulluk and Shell’s second rig were expected to return to the Arctic this year. But the grounding and several other episodes last year have raised questions about the company’s drilling plans in the region.",2430

The agency, acting under a court deadline, set an annual standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air, a significant tightening from the previous standard of 15 micrograms, set in 1997, which a federal court found too weak to adequately protect public health. The new standard is in the middle of the range of 11 to 13 micrograms per cubic meter that the E.P.A.’s science advisory panel recommended. Communities must meet the new standard by 2020 or face possible penalties, including loss of federal transportation financing. The E.P.A. based its action on health studies that found that exposure to fine particles — in this case measuring 2.5 micrometers in diameter — brought a marked increase in heart and lung disease, acute asthma attacks and early death. Older people, adults with heart and lung ailments and children are particularly susceptible to the ill effects. The agency estimates the benefit of the new rule at $4 billion to $9 billion a year, and the annual costs of putting it into effect at $53 million to $350 million. “These fine particles penetrate deep into the lungs, causing serious and costly health effects,” said Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator. “As the mother of two sons who have battled asthma, the benefits are not just numbers or abstract concepts.” Today 66 counties in eight states do not meet the new standard, including the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Houston, St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland and Pittsburgh. The E.P.A. estimates that by 2020, when the rule is fully in force, only seven counties, all of them in California, will still be out of compliance. Other current rules on mercury, sulfur and other pollution from vehicles, factories and power plants will cause that reduction. “We know clearly that particle pollution is harmful at levels well below those previously deemed to be safe,” Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “It will save lives,” he said. Utility industry officials pleaded with the E.P.A. on Thursday to delay the release of the new rule, arguing that the standard is based on incomplete science and would impose costly new burdens on states and cities. Utilities, joined by trade associations representing manufacturers, chemical companies and the oil and gas industry, said the new rule would push many communities into noncompliance, making it harder to obtain permits for new businesses that create jobs. Scott H. Segal, representing a coalition of coal companies and utilities, wrote to Ms. Jackson, pointing to a 2011 study saying that citing counties for noncompliance “increases energy prices, reduces manufacturing productivity and causes local manufacturing companies to exit the areas that are designated as being in nonattainment.” Six senators, led by Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, wrote Ms. Jackson on Friday expressing concern about the new rule. “E.P.A. should not rush at this time toward imposing more regulatory burdens on struggling areas,” the lawmakers wrote. Advocates of the new rule said these complaints were overblown. “While the health benefits are extensive, opponents of common-sense pollution standards are repeating false time-worn claims that clean air is too costly,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund. Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who led the E.P.A.’s air quality office in President George W. Bush’s administration and who now represents business clients, took a more sanguine view of the agency’s action than many other industry spokesmen. He said the impact of the new rule would depend on how the E.P.A. chooses to enforce it. “Normally, a new standard means a rash of new regulations, but E.P.A. claims that virtually every area of the country will meet the new standard without the need for new regulatory requirements,” he said in an e-mail. “If so, then maybe the new standard won’t cause the type of economic disruption that we’ve seen in the past.”",4250
50b507b600315214fbb7c19c,2012-11-24T20:55:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/business/energy-environment/24iht-ukenergy24.html,Environment,"LONDON — The British government announced on Friday far-reaching changes in energy regulation intended to encourage development of renewable energy and nuclear power while ensuring that the country can still meet its electricity needs. The changes will gradually quadruple the charges levied on consumers and businesses to help support electricity generation from low-carbon sources, to a total of about £9.8 billion, or $15.7 billion, in the 2020-21 fiscal year, from £2.35 billion now. The government forecasts that the new price supports will add 7 percent, or about £95 a year, to the average household electricity bill. Such charges add 2 percent to energy bills, or £20 a year. The effort shows that Britain, despite an ailing economy, is sticking to the ambitious goals for renewable energy and emissions reductions set in 2008 under the Labour government of Gordon Brown. Britain is also shifting its approach toward energy. In the 1990s, Britain led Europe in deregulation of its energy markets. Now it is returning to a system of greater market intervention to fulfill what the government considers to be an imperative to reduce greenhouse gases. Electricity generated from cleaner sources like nuclear and offshore wind is much more expensive than power generated by coal- or gas-fired plants. Companies will invest in clean energy only if given substantial incentives. The government hopes to attract £110 billion in energy investment through 2020. The proposed regulatory changes will be incorporated in an energy bill that is to be approved next year, with the new rules phased in starting in 2014. “In the 1990s there was a real move to make the U.K. power market a kind of liberalized, supply-demand, price-driven market,” said Howard V. Rogers, director of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, a research group. “As soon as you introduce subsidies for wind, you undermine that principle.” The proposed changes come after months of debate within the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. The Liberal Democrats favor tough goals to reduce emissions. The Conservatives, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, lean more toward promoting the use of natural gas. They also worry that wind farms will spoil the countryside, where many Conservative voters reside. The government proposal “will allow us to meet our legally binding carbon reduction and renewable energy obligations and bring on the investment required to keep the lights on and bills affordable for consumers,” Edward Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said in a statement. Mr. Davey added that the proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources would increase to 30 percent by 2020, from 11 percent today. Businesses are likely to welcome the bill because, if nothing else, it reduces the uncertainty that has made big investment decisions difficult. “This package will send a strong signal to investors that the government is serious about providing firms with the certainty they need to invest in affordable, secure, low-carbon energy,” John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, the country’s main business group, said in a statement. The renewable energy industry said it would welcome increased government support. “This is a crucial announcement for the renewable energy sector,” said Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK, a trade association. “This blows the last few months of political infighting completely out of the water.” Some environmental groups, however, said that the government should set stricter emission targets for power companies. “By failing to agree to any carbon target for the power sector until after the next election, David Cameron has allowed a militant tendency within his own ranks to derail the energy bill,” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said in a statement. “It’s a blatant assault on the greening of the U.K. economy that leaves consumers vulnerable to rising gas prices, and sends billions of pounds of clean-tech investment to our economic rivals.” Others said they were appalled by support for new nuclear installations. While nuclear plants are low carbon emitters, they bring risks of accidents as well as the unresolved problem of what to do with spent fuel. Stephan Singer, head of energy policy in Brussels for the World Wildlife Fund, said his organization was “fundamentally opposed” to price supports for nuclear power. With energy costs already a major source of complaint, consumers are unlikely to be happy with the government plan. “These higher energy costs are likely to hit low-income consumers hard,” said Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, which sells consumers electricity online at favorable rates. Britain intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. Until now, wind power has been the main beneficiary of government intervention. Now the government has come to believe that while building more nuclear plants would be costly and contentious, they will be necessary to reach emission targets. At present there is likely to be only one new plant in operation by 2020, said Kirsty Alexander, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Industry Association, a trade group. Additional government support is likely to benefit EDF, the utility that owns most of the nuclear plants in Britain. EDF, with the British utility Centrica as a partner, wants to build a series of new reactors, starting with two at Hinkley Point in Somerset in southwest England. “We recognize the government’s continued commitment to deliver the timetable for electricity market reform, including legally robust arrangements for much-needed projects during the transition,” Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, said in a statement. “This is good news and a significant step toward providing secure, low-carbon energy for the U.K. for many years to come.” About 18 percent of Britain’s power comes from nuclear sources, but that figure may decline. The last nuclear plant to open in Britain was Sizewell B in 1995, and several nuclear plants are scheduled to shut down in the next few years. The government has identified eight sites suitable for new reactors, all at the sites of existing power plants. The government said it would promote development of nuclear and wind power through a new mechanism called a contract for difference. Under the program, a new government-owned entity would guarantee companies that produce power from nuclear or wind a certain price for the electricity they produce. The companies will be compensated if actual prices fall below that “strike price.” “It will manage the payments under the contract,” said Fiona Reilly, head of the nuclear services practice at Norton Rose, a London law firm. “That might mean paying money to generators and it might mean taking money from generators if power prices are higher than the strike price.” EDF’s decision to go ahead at Hinkley Point still depends on where the government sets that strike price. The opinion among utility companies is that it will need to be at least £100 per megawatt hour, roughly double the current price of electricity. Another open question is whether Britain would violate European Union rules on state aid by supporting nuclear power, a mature technology. Britain “is heading for trouble with the E.U.,” said Mr. Singer of the World Wildlife Fund. “State aid regulations rule out any support for mature technologies.” Nick Turton, a spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, said the government was working with Brussels to ensure that Britain conformed to European rules.",7684
53f7ca4138f0d835538dc2f4,2012-06-14T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/science/earth/canada-seeks-new-ways-to-get-oil-reserves-to-market.html,Environment,"LONDON, Ontario — As the United States continues to play political Ping-Pong with the fate of the Keystone XL pipeline, Canadian officials and companies are desperately seeking alternatives to get the country’s nearly 200 billion barrels in oil reserves — almost equal to that of Saudi Arabia — to market from landlocked Alberta. Oil companies complain that they are losing revenues from pipeline bottlenecks. So Canada is plunging ahead with plans to build more pipelines of its own. To hasten development of new export routes, the Conservative government is streamlining permit processes by accelerating scheduled hearings and limiting public comment. The government has also threatened to revoke the charitable status of environmental groups that are challenging the projects. And Public Safety Canada, the equivalent of the United States Department of Homeland Security, has classified environmentalists as a potential source of domestic terrorism, adding them to a list that includes white supremacists. After President Obama refused to grant a permit for Keystone XL in January, Stephen Harper, Canada’s prime minister, indicated that he would never again be “held hostage” to United States politics, saying that some Americans saw his country as “one giant national park.” He said Canada would redirect oil that had been destined for Gulf Coast refineries to other countries, particularly China. While Joe Oliver, Canada’s minister of natural resources, said in an interview that the United States would remain Canada’s “most important customer,” billions of barrels of oil that would have been refined and used in the United States are now poised to head elsewhere. Expansion of Canada’s fast-growing oil-sands industry will be restricted by the lack of pipeline capacity before the decade’s end, he said, which “adds to the urgency of building them so that the resources will not be stranded.” Three new pipeline network proposals — two that call for heading west and the other east — have been put forward. In May, Enbridge, a transporter of Canadian oil exports, announced a $3 billion plan called Eastern Access. It is seeking permission to build a new “Northern Gateway Pipelines” network, to bring 525,000 barrels a day to Canada’s Pacific Coast. Kinder Morgan, a Texas-based energy company, said it will nearly double the capacity of an existing pipeline network along a different route. Together, the new westward pipelines would carry more oil than Keystone XL would. But even with aggressive government backing, creating new pipelines may prove as difficult in Canada as it has been in the United States, though for different reasons. Indigenous groups must be consulted if new pipelines cross their land. To gain coastal access, pipeline companies must also navigate the politics of some of the most environmentally conscious Canadian provinces, British Columbia and Quebec, where public opinion tends to be against both pipelines and further fossil fuel development. Vancouver’s City Council recently passed a motion requiring that pipeline companies take on 100 percent liability for the economic and environmental costs of a worst-case spill. Even though the federal government gives permissions for pipelines, such local maneuvering and lawsuits can cause severe delays. “It’s poetic justice that Vancouver, the birthplace of Greenpeace, stands between the last big oil deposit on Earth and the expanding markets in Asia,” said Ben West of the Wilderness Committee, a consortium of environmental groups. “I’d anticipate it won’t get built for years.” Mr. Obama said no to Keystone XL over issues of routing and insufficient environmental analysis, after a showdown with Congressional Republicans. No further action is expected before next year, although the pipeline builder, TransCanada, has reapplied for a permit. But as pipeline companies cast about, the United States may again be drawn into the fray over routes in other parts of the country. The most likely eastern Canadian pipeline route would reverse existing pipelines through Ontario and Quebec, and then cross the border into Vermont, heading to a tanker port in Portland, Me. Such a project was proposed in 2008 but dropped during the recession. A State Department spokesman said it had not fielded inquiries to revive the idea, but residents of the United States’s Northeast are organizing against it. Without a reliable way out, Canadian oil often trades for $30 a barrel less than other crudes, said Todd Nogier, an Enbridge spokesman. The company estimates its proposed new westbound pipeline will increase Canada’s gross domestic product by $270 billion over 30 years. Chinese companies have already invested in Canadian oil sands. Environmentalists are not nearly as enthusiastic. One reason is that Canadian oil is extracted in a process that creates relatively high emissions of carbon dioxide. Also, oil from oil sands is exported as bitumen, a gritty paste that must be thinned with chemicals for transport. The United States Pipeline Safety and Hazardous Materials Administration is studying whether diluted bitumen is more corrosive and prone to dangerous spills than conventional crude, thus requiring special regulation. The report is due next year. A 2010 spill of diluted bitumen from an Enbridge pipeline in Battle Creek, Mich., has cost over $720 million, and parts of the Kalamazoo River remain closed. In Canada, environmental groups and opposition politicians say Mr. Harper’s government is trampling on civil liberties and due process in its rush to get bitumen to market. Public hearings on proposed pipelines were expedited from the fall to the spring, leaving groups little time to organize and mount challenges to inadequate environmental analysis of the impacts, said Gillian McEachern of Environmental Defense, a Canadian environment group. Ms. McEachern said that the application process for public comment was made so complicated that many with opposing views were shut out. Last month here in London, a coalition that included environmentalists and members of aboriginal tribes disrupted what was to have been an obscure public hearing. Enbridge’s Eastern Access expansion plan involves moving bitumen from Alberta east to Montreal by reversing the directional flow in older pipelines that now carry refined oil westward to Ontario. The hearing was solely about allowing a change of direction for a 100-mile pipeline segment. “We sent a letter asking to speak and didn’t even get a reply,” said Wes Elliot, of the Six Nations indigenous group, one of several dozen ejected by the police for speaking without permission. The hearing was then closed to the public. On the curb outside, he said he worried about spills. Under Canadian law, aboriginal groups must be consulted about pipeline projects that cross their lands. Enbridge has offered many tribes a 10 percent stake in its westward pipeline project; Graham White, an Enbridge spokesman, said about half have accepted. Others in attendance said proposed bitumen pipelines would traverse vital agricultural aquifers — concerns that tripped up Keystone XL in the United States. “They say they’re just tinkering with existing pipeline,” said Steven Guilbeault, co-founder of Equiterre, a Canadian environmental group. “We think they’re doing it bit by bit so they won’t attract attention like Keystone.” Mr. White said there was currently no plan for a pipeline extending into the United States, but would not rule it out in the case of market demand. Groups in Vermont and Maine are girding for a fight, concerned most about spills in Maine’s Casco Bay, a center of fishing and tourism. Glen Brand, head of the Sierra Club’s Maine chapter, said that a meeting on the issue in Bangor this spring attracted over 100 people. On both coasts of North America, residents object to a predicted manyfold increase in tanker traffic in harbors where people relocate to enjoy the pristine beauty. Simon Donner, a scientist at the University of British Columbia, sees the pipeline as symptomatic of the weakness of Canada’s climate policy, and said he thinks the Canadian government is underestimating the opposition. “People won’t roll over on this issue,” he said.",8226

The decision, the third trade case decided this year in favor of American wind and solar manufacturers, will be followed by another in the coming weeks on whether Chinese companies engaged in dumping the towers in the United States at prices below the cost of making them. This month, the Commerce Department said China was dumping solar panels in the American market and imposed duties of 31 percent on the imports, adding to earlier duties imposed under a department ruling that China unfairly subsidized its solar manufacturers. Some trade experts have warned that the series of rulings will increase trade tensions with China, which has already filed its own complaints about subsidies that federal and state governments give to American wind and solar companies. As a result of the decision announced Wednesday, the Commerce Department said it would tell American customs agents to collect a cash deposit on imported towers equal to the preliminary rates. These duties would be substantial, because the towers can cost $600,000 each. “These are large subsidy margins, and they likely will have significant impact on the market,” said Alan H. Price, a lawyer at Wiley Rein, which represented the Wind Tower Trade Coalition, the group of American manufacturers that brought the case. American imports of Chinese towers reached $222 million last year, according to the Commerce Department. But the size of the American market is not clear for this year and next year, because the main federal subsidy program, the production tax credit, is scheduled to expire and will not apply to any projects entering service after this year. The pending expiration has already suppressed new orders, wind industry executives say. The Commerce Department’s International Trade Administration said that CS Wind and its affiliates will be charged a 13.7 percent duty, and Titan Wind Energy and its affiliates will be charged 26 percent. All other companies will be charged a 19.9 percent duty. The decision won praise from the United Steelworkers, which filed a broader case in September 2010 in which it accused China of unfairly subsidizing its renewable energy industries. “We have plate mills that are idle right now as a consequence, so this is a good deal,” said Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for the union, referring to the wind tower decision. The towers are made by rolling steel plate into tubes, welding the seams and stacking the tubes on top of each other. A spokesman at the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. John Breckenridge, an expert in financing renewable energy projects at Good Energies Capital in New York, said that while the wind decision comes after similar rulings on solar equipment imports, the two industries are quite different. In contrast to the huge Chinese presence in the American solar industry, he said, its involvement in wind is still relatively small. “This does not have a big impact on the business as it is today, but it is clear that the Chinese products have been banging on the door, with significantly lower costs,” he said. “It was only a matter of time before that door was going to start to open, and this could slow that down.” The rulings on solar cells have split the American solar industry, with firms that make the equipment applauding the rulings but ones that sell and install such systems lamenting that higher costs will reduce their sales. The American wind industry has not taken a position on the wind tower case. American tower manufacturers have a parallel dumping case pending against Vietnamese tower makers, although they did not accuse the Vietnamese makers of receiving unfair subsidies.",3945
4fd2baaa8eb7c8105d8b18b8,2012-05-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/business/energy-environment/seeking-disclosure-on-fracking.html,Environment,"AUSTIN, TEXAS — As the controversial oil and gas drilling practice known as hydraulic fracturing continues to spread, governments around the world are grappling with how to regulate it. What should happen to the waste after the process, called fracking, ends? What taxes should oil and natural gas companies pay? What about earthquakes and air pollution? One regulatory trend is becoming well-established: requirements that drilling companies disclose information about the chemicals used in fracking. The process involves shooting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals down a well to extract oil or gas deposited in shale rock. The chemicals are used for functions like reducing friction or killing bacteria. But the particulars of the disclosure requirements can differ significantly, and environmentalists are urging that they be broadened. U.S. states that have enacted fracking disclosure legislation or rules include Arkansas, Colorado, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming. Ohio’s legislature approved disclosure rules last week that the governor is expected to sign into law. California is considering disclosure legislation, and the U.S. Interior Department, a repository of public lands, has also proposed disclosure rules. In a report published this week, the International Energy Agency urged policy makers to adopt “full, mandatory disclosure of fracturing fluid additives and volumes,” to avoid sowing mistrust about fracking activities. In Britain, a report last year on shale gas produced for the House of Commons included a recommendation that the Environment Agency (which covers England and Wales) require information on the “type, concentration and volume” of all chemicals used in fracking. (The U.K. government responded that disclosure was mandated in situations where groundwater was nearby.) Another recent draft report, for the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, backed mandatory disclosures. In effect, Europe appears to be observing the U.S. experience and learning from it. The push toward disclosure derives from concerns that fracking could contaminate groundwater. Drilling companies counter that this fear is baseless; they note that fracking occurs well below aquifers and that chemicals constitute only a small portion of the fracking fluids. Environmentalists in the United States argue that the states’ disclosure requirements, while welcome, are inadequate. States’ rules generally contain a “trade secrets” provision that allows companies to withhold public disclosures of certain chemicals so they can avoid giving away proprietary recipes for the fracking fluids. Some states require companies to report those chemicals to regulators (which keep the information confidential, barring a legitimate public challenge), while others, like Colorado, do not even require the industry to disclose the “trade secrets” chemicals to the regulators, according to Damon Nagami, a staff attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, based in Santa Monica, California. Another point of contention is when the disclosures should take place. Proposed legislation in California would require disclosure of the chemicals that are used in hydraulic fracturing, as well as their concentrations, within 60 days of the fracking. “We think the information should be submitted before,” said Mr. Nagami. “California doesn’t have any regulations on fracking, and we’re way behind and need to catch up.” Companies have often embraced the state-level disclosure rules to strengthen public confidence in drilling and avoid bringing broad federal rules. “We have supported state regulators’ work to require disclosure protocols most appropriate for them,” Dan Whitten, a spokesman for America’s Natural Gas Alliance, an industry group, said in an e-mail. In Europe, where skepticism about fracking has prompted a ban in France, the drilling industry is calling for more openness. In a speech in Houston in March, Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, called for a hydraulic fracturing disclosure initiative in Europe similar to the year-old Fracfocus.org Web site that U.S. companies often use to list fracking chemicals. Such disclosures, Mr. Tillerson said, would “lead to open and fruitful discussion about the risks we manage and the benefits we foresee for shale and tight-sand gas-and-oil development in Europe.” In the United States, an interesting discussion has occurred in Ohio, home of the booming Utica Shale, where state lawmakers passed a complex fracking regulation bill last week that includes disclosure requirements. As originally proposed, the legislation would have required disclosure of the chemicals used throughout the drilling process, not merely in the fracking itself. The difference is that the term “fracking” refers to a specific act, namely the breaking up of shale rock, and does not apply to many other parts of the drilling process, which runs from the initial drilling to the plugging of the well, not to mention the disposal of the waste. “There are a lot of nasty chemicals that are used throughout the life cycle of the well,” said Matt Watson, the senior energy policy manager at the Environmental Defense Fund, which has been pushing for regulation of the whole process. The issue, he added, is spills, which are “the most common way that this stuff gets released into the environment.” Asked about the Ohio push for broader disclosures, Amy Emmert, a policy adviser with the American Petroleum Institute, noted that a “complex framework of laws” already governs oil and gas drilling activity. The version of the bill that Ohio lawmakers passed last week does not contain the life cycle disclosure requirements the environmental group had sought. Nonetheless, the bill is slightly broader than most other states’ rules in requiring some disclosures beyond simply fracking, according to Mr. Watson — and it may, he said, bring about a conversation about what disclosure rules should include. “I think to the extent that everyone’s been so focused on hydraulic fracturing,” Mr. Watson said, “it has obscured the fact that there’s a wide range of risks associated with oil and gas production.”",6264
4fd2a7cd8eb7c8105d8916b9,2012-05-29T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/business/energy-environment/even-in-kentucky-coal-industry-is-under-siege.html,Environment,"LOUISA, Ky. — For generations, coal has been king in this Appalachian town. It provided heat, light and jobs for the hundreds of people who worked in the nearby coal mines and the smoke-coughing Big Sandy power plant that burned their black bounty. But now, coal is in a corner. Across the United States, the industry is under siege, threatened by new regulations from Washington, environmentalists fortified by money from Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York City, and natural gas companies intent on capturing much of the nation’s energy market. So when the operator of the Big Sandy plant announced last year that it would be switching from coal to cleaner, cheaper natural gas, people here took it as the worst betrayal imaginable. “Have you lost your mind?” State Representative Rocky Adkins, a Democrat and one of Kentucky’s most powerful politicians, thundered at Michael G. Morris, the chairman of the plant’s operator, American Electric Power, during an encounter last summer. “You cannot wave the white flag and let the environmentalists and regulators declare victory here in the heart of coal country.” Coal and electric utilities, long allied, are beginning to split. More than 100 of the 500 or so coal-burning power plants in the United States are expected to be shut down in the next few years. While coal still provides about a third of the nation’s power, just four years ago it was providing nearly half. The decline is largely because new pollution rules have made coal plants more costly, while a surge in production of natural gas through the process of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, has sent gas prices plummeting. Together, the economics of coal have been transformed after a century of dominance in Washington, state capitals and the board rooms of electric utilities. “The math screams at you to do gas,” said Mr. Morris, whose company is the nation’s largest consumer of coal. Environmental groups, after years of targeting coal plants as leading sources of air pollution, have moved in for the kill. “We never thought we would get to a place where coal plants are falling so fast,” said Bruce Nilles, the director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal initiative. It has been aided by $50 million from Mr. Bloomberg, who views the campaign as part of a public health effort, and $26 million from an odd bedfellow: the top official of a natural gas company. The environmentalists figure that if they can shut down a third of the nation’s coal burning plants by 2020, emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States could be cut at least as much as they would have under a landmark 2009 climate bill that died in Congress. But the coal industry is mustering all the weapons it can: lobbying, legislation, litigation and a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign trumpeting the benefits of “clean coal.” The fight has even become an issue in the presidential campaign, with the industry blaming President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency for the onslaught, and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, hinting that he would roll back some of the rules. Here in Kentucky, the intervention by Mr. Adkins and other coal industry advocates has saved coal at Big Sandy, at least temporarily. American Electric Power, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, is proposing a $1 billion retrofit to allow the plant to continue burning coal and has asked Kentucky regulators to approve a 30 percent increase in electricity rates to pay for the work. But that request, which will come up for a vote by the state’s utility commission within the next week, has inspired resistance from some residents, large industrial companies that consume much of Kentucky’s electricity and even the state attorney general’s office. Pressured on the domestic front, some giant American coal producers, like Arch Coal and Peabody Energy, are shifting their attention to markets overseas, where coal-fired power plants are being built faster than they are being abandoned in the United States. Even if Big Sandy continues to eat up 90 rail cars of coal a day, the industry’s decline is evident here. Sales to Midwestern power plants have slumped, as has the market price of coal, dropping so suddenly that many local mines are cutting back hours or closing. A warm winter, decreasing demand, only made matters worse. “I call it the imperfect storm,” Mr. Adkins said. “And it is breaking the back of our local economy.” A Coordinated Effort The anger toward Washington is palpable in this impoverished corner of Eastern Kentucky, where miners display bumper stickers or license plates on their pickup trucks with slogans like “Coal Keeps the Lights On” or “If Obama Is the Answer, How Stupid Was the Question?” It is hard to find anyone here who does not feel affected by the fate of Big Sandy. Just as the smokestack at the plant towers over the countryside, Big Sandy dominates much of life here. Danny Sartin, 61, a barrel-chested heavy equipment operator at the plant, said his father, grandfathers and uncles all worked in local mines that feed Big Sandy. “Coal and the coal mining industry, it’s all we have ever known,” Mr. Sartin said. Some of that coal comes from the Licking River mine, about 50 miles south of Big Sandy, where miners rip apart hillsides to reach vast seams just below the surface. Chris Lacy, 41, an executive at Licking River Resources Inc., said layoffs among his 350 miners — in Magoffin County, where unemployment is already 17.5 percent — are inevitable if the coal furnaces at Big Sandy go cold. Even the garden supply company that Mr. Lacy’s father-in-law owns and where his two sons work indirectly relies on Big Sandy, because mines are required to plant grass over the scarred earth they leave behind. “It is the ripple effect that comes right through us,” Mr. Lacy said. Channeling the animosity toward Washington and fears about their livelihoods, coal producers, union leaders, landowners and railroads came together to pressure American Electric Power to back down on its plan to close the coal furnaces at Big Sandy. They have leaned on county judges, state legislators and other politicians to attempt to silence public criticism of the 30 percent electricity rate increase and to pressure the Kentucky Public Service Commission to approve the retrofit project. Saving coal, they argued, justified the rate increase, which would cost the average residential customer about $472 a year in addition to the typical $1,580 annual bill today. “I will grant you it is going to cost a lot of money to retrofit that plant,” said Nick Carter, the president of a company that represents landowners whose properties hold billions of tons of coal reserves. “But how many teachers will be laid off and how many churches will have to close if Big Sandy stops burning coal?” At Dee’s Drive Inn Restaurant, a fixture on Main Street in Louisa, the patrons are split. Fred Klinebriel, 58, a disabled former steelworker, said his father was a mine worker and his brother a trucker who moved coal. But if keeping coal means an even bigger electric bill, he is not sure it is worth it. “I am up against the wall right now as it is,” he said. “I guess you are damned if you do and damned if you don’t — or at least we are here in coal country.” Environmental Issues What went largely unspoken in the dozens of pages of e-mails, letters and other pitches these players have churned out in the fight to keep the plant open were the perils of coal, which extend far beyond mine accidents and black lung disease. The Big Sandy plant spews tens of thousands of tons of pollutants each year into the region’s air, including sulfur dioxide and smaller amounts of mercury, which can cause health problems like respiratory illnesses and possibly developmental disabilities among children. Many of these pollutants would be significantly reduced with the retrofit, but the plant would continue to be a major source of carbon dioxide, which is blamed for global warming. Big Sandy also maintains a sprawling coal ash pit near the plant, created to store waste ash after the coal is burned, that the E.P.A. recently listed  as one of 45 “high hazard” pits nationwide. That means it “will probably cause loss of human life,” the E.P.A. says, if a serious accident occurs. In Tennessee in 2008, a billion gallons of slurry from a coal ash pit washed out area homes and streams, though no deaths resulted. Meanwhile, federal regulators have accused the owners of Licking River of dumping debris, known as spoil, from another nearby mine into a local valley, harming wildlife and an intermittent local stream. Mr. Lacy, the Licking River executive, says such concerns are overblown. Instead, he talks of a conspiracy by environmentalists and the Obama administration to destroy the way of life here in Kentucky. “I at least have to give them some credit,” he said. “It has been well played on their part, very methodical, step by step.” Some of the regulations the industry finds objectionable, though, had their origins in a Republican administration. In 1990, President George Bush proposed and Congress approved sweeping revisions to the Clean Air Act, authorizing the E.P.A. to regulate emissions of mercury, arsenic and other toxic airborne chemicals. The agency determined in 2000 that it had the power to limit such emissions from power plants, but a weak rule issued under the second Bush administration was successfully challenged in court by environmental advocates. The Obama administration, acting under court order, issued new standards in December that would require more emissions reductions by all but the top-performing plants. Gina McCarthy, the director of the Office of Air and Radiation at the E.P.A., said that accusations of collusion between the agency and environmental advocates were unfounded. “Coal will continue to be a large part of electric generation in this country for a long time,” Ms. McCarthy said in an interview. “I just hope it is cleaner.” Mr. Lacy is hardly convinced. As he drove through the Licking River mine during a shift change one recent afternoon, his face reddened. “If they keep this up, the people who live here are going to have to move somewhere else, like during the Depression,” he said. “This place is suffering in a bad way.” Unlikely Allies Tacked up on the wall in a cramped office in Columbus, Ohio, that serves as the Midwest headquarters for the Sierra Club is a map of the United States with the headline “Coal Plants Under Target.” Dozens of color-coded pins form a giant U shape — from Minnesota, south to Missouri, east to Kentucky and then up to Ohio — with each marking a plant that the Sierra Club is determined to shut down. For years, the group filed lawsuits to try to force utilities or federal regulators to comply with pollution-control laws and organized public opinion campaigns to try to block the construction of plants. But the change in the energy marketplace has given the environmentalists an extraordinary new weapon: the pocketbooks of consumers. “The coal industry used to be able to get away with murder, here in Ohio and throughout Appalachia,” said Nachy Kanfer, 27, a Sierra Club organizer. “Not anymore.” In late April, Mr. Kanfer and other Sierra Club staff members traveled to Kentucky to  testify before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. They argued that American Electric Power should not be allowed to retrofit Big Sandy — an argument they are making in many states — because there are less expensive alternatives to deliver power. Elsewhere, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups are also pressing local officials in metropolitan areas to help shut down coal-burning power plants. In Chicago, for example, Mayor Rahm Emanuelrecently announced that the city’s last two coal-fired plants would close in 2014, four years earlier than expected. One of the most important early allies in this fight was Aubrey K. McClendon, the chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, who donated $26 million starting in 2007 to help the Sierra Club with its campaign. The company also donated millions of dollars more to the American Lung Association, which used the money, in part, to run “Fighting for Air” television commercials. Some of the most recent ads in the campaign feature a baby coughing, wheezing and then crying while sitting outside a coal-fired power plant. The Sierra Club came under attack from other environmental activists for accepting money from Mr. McClendon, whose company has a financial interest in killing off its competition but burns a fossil fuel itself. Mr. Nilles, the director of Beyond Coal, now views it as a mistake. “We would not do it again,” he said. Other deep-pocketed donors have stepped in, including Mr. Bloomberg, whose intervention has infuriated Kentucky officials like Mr. Adkins, the legislator. “Mayor Bloomberg should stay in that high-rise condo or his mansions,” Mr. Adkins said, “and eat his caviar while we keep his lights on in New York City.” Big Coal has hardly conceded defeat in this multifront war. The industry has increased political campaign contributions in the last four years to historic levels, with 80 percent of those donations going to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Companies like Arch Coal, which used to spend only about $100,000 a year on lobbyists in Washington, invested $5.7 million to push its case during the first three years of the Obama administration. And even as American Electric Power plans to close 5 of its 21 coal-burning plants and rely much more on natural gas, it still intends to retrofit 12 plants. That means it will be burning coal for years to come. A rise in natural gas prices could also slow the decline of coal as a power source. So the company has joined with old allies in Washington to try to delay the new rules and block any future ones. The industry and its supporters have also gone to court, filing lawsuits challenging E.P.A. rules that limit pollution from coal-burning plants from crossing state lines and the mountaintop mining rules that are holding up new permits in Kentucky and West Virginia — legal fights that the industry has had some success with so far. But the regional agency that coordinates electric power delivery in the mid-Atlantic and the Midwest cannot wait for the battles to be resolved. This month, it auctioned off the rights for utility companies to supply electricity that will be needed to make up for what is lost through coal plant retirements. Most of the new power is fueled by natural gas. “It’s an unprecedented transition,” said Michael J. Kormos, senior vice president for operations at PJM Interconnection, the regional group that coordinates power delivery for 60 million people in 13 states. “But whatever happens, we have to make sure we keep the lights on.”",14877

Macfarlane, a professor of environmental science at George Mason University, to serve as chairwoman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If confirmed, she would replace Gregory B. Jaczko, who announced his resignation from the politically divided commission this week after months of struggles with fellow commissioners and Congress over management and safety issues. Dr. Macfarlane, 48, a geologist and an expert on nuclear waste disposal, has the support of Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, who called her “eminently qualified” to lead the commission. But she is likely to face sharp questions from Republican senators who have complained about what they consider excessive politicization and internal strife at the commission, which oversees the nation’s 104 nuclear reactors. She has been critical of plans to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, saying that the area is vulnerable to seismic and volcanic activity. She has also said that waste stored there would be exposed to oxygen and water, posing a danger to the surrounding environment. The White House said it would move quickly to replace Dr. Jaczko to ensure that the five-member commission functions smoothly after a rocky period. “Dr. Macfarlane is a highly regarded expert who was a member of the president’s Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future and has spent years analyzing nuclear issues while at George Mason University, Harvard University as well as at M.I.T.,” said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman. “A strong and effective N.R.C. is crucial to protecting public health and safety, promoting defense and security and protecting the environment,” The Senate is currently considering Mr. Obama’s appointment of Kristine L.

But most drivers will find prices only modestly lower than a year ago. Nationwide, the price of a gallon of regular gasoline has been drifting lower by about half a cent a day over the last month, and energy analysts say that trend should continue over the next few weeks, in at least some states. “Drivers are getting a respite,” said Rodney L. Waller, a senior vice president at Range Resources, an oil and gas company based in Fort Worth. “But it’s a tenuous respite based on all the changes in the global oil market and the opening and closings of refineries across the U.S.” Gasoline prices are dropping primarily because of a decline in global crude oil prices, stemming from an easing of tensions in the Middle East and growing oil supplies, bolstered in recent months by the rapid return of Libyan oil exports and increased production from Saudi Arabia. Because oil is priced in dollars, the firming value of the dollar in recent weeks in the wake of the European financial crisis has also helped reduce prices. The sluggish global economy has also reduced demand for oil and other commodities, particularly in Europe. Demand growth in China, a main driver of oil prices in recent years, has slowed in recent months. And while gasoline demand in the United States has diminished in recent months because of the soft economy, oil supply inventories recently reached a 22-year high. Gasoline prices on the East Coast have fallen in part because one large refinery in Philadelphia that was scheduled to be closed by Sunoco at the end of June is now expected to remain open through at least most of the summer while the private equity firm the Carlyle Group negotiates to form a joint venture. Prospects for future gasoline prices in the region have also improved since Delta Air Lines bought an idled Pennsylvania refinery, which will probably produce more gasoline for the market by October. On the West Coast, however, particularly around Los Angeles, gasoline prices have actually risen in recent weeks because several refineries were forced to suspend operations because of power failures and repairs to compressors. But those problems are expected to be cleared up by June, and energy experts expect prices to ease afterward. The diverging refinery situations are reflected in the wide gap in gasoline prices from one coast to the other. The average price for regular gasoline on Thursday was $3.92 a gallon in New York but $4.31 a gallon in California. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Thursday was $3.67, nearly 30 cents below the high for the year reached in early April. A year ago, the average prices stood at $3.85 a gallon. Energy analysts say prices this summer should remain a few cents lower than last year but about 75 cents a gallon above the level in the summer of 2010. The economic effect of the lower prices is tentative because prices could easily surge again. “Compared to 2009 and 2010, these are still stiff prices,” said Tom Kloza, the chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service. “People talk about this wonderful dividend, but measured against history, gasoline still represents a considerable slice of consumer disposable income.” Mr. Kloza projected that the national average price for regular gasoline during the Memorial Day weekend would be at most only a few pennies below the current price, and would range from $3.50 to $3.75 for the rest of the summer. Light sweet crude, the benchmark of New York trading, remained stubbornly above $100 a barrel for most of the last year. In recent weeks it has fallen to just above $90, and remained near that level on Thursday. The spike in oil prices last year was because of the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East, especially the loss of more than a million barrels a day of high-quality crude from Libya during the insurrection against the Qaddafi dictatorship. After easing for a few months, prices surged again early this year over fears that Iran might block supplies from passing through the Strait of Hormuz in response to tightening European and United States sanctions or the possibility of an Israeli or American attack on Iranian nuclear plants. The sanctions have reduced Iranian exports, but increased exports from Libya, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have so far more than compensated for the drop-off in China, India and other Asian countries that have relied on supplies from Iran. Total OPEC output of oil and other liquid fuels is at a record high of 37.5 million barrels a day, despite the loss of Iranian exports. But oil analysts warn that prices could surge again if instability interrupts production in any number of shaky producing nations. Traders were watching how a second round of talks between members of the United Nations Security Council, Germany and Iran would proceed this week, but there appeared to have been little progress. Hopes that Iran would be willing to curb its nuclear program had helped send oil prices lower, but further tightening of sanctions on Iran could send crude prices higher in the months ahead. “If there are any problems on the supply side, as in Iran, Libya or Nigeria, then prices will be right back up,” said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research. “Global inventories are not that high, and production is pretty much flat out in OPEC. A lot depends on how negotiations go with Iran.” While production in the United States is about a million barrels a day higher than last year, now reaching 5.9 million barrels a day, several other international producers outside of OPEC are not doing nearly as well. Unrest in South Sudan has halted nearly half a million barrels a day of production. Offshore oil spills have dented output in China and Brazil, and production from the North Sea continues to decline.",5919

The secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar, said the plan would allow the river’s managers to release excess water — more than twice as much as average flows — through and over the hydroelectric dam at will to help propel silt and sediment downstream into the canyon. By mimicking the river’s original dynamics, Interior Department officials said, the flows could help restore the backwater ecosystems in which native fish are most at home. The goal is partly to enhance sandbars that create backwaters for an endangered fish, the humpback chub. The excess sand also nourishes beaches used by wildlife, hikers and rafters. Environmental groups like the Grand Canyon Trust strongly support the high-flow releases, which have been carried out experimentally three times before, most recently in 2008. In a telephone news conference, Mr. Salazar said the releases would be timed for when storms or snowmelt have carried large amounts of silt just downriver from the dam. The first high-flow release under the new protocol will probably come this fall, he added. “The triggering conditions are related to the amount of sediment in the system,” he said. When heavy rains occur in the Paria River watershed, which drains rocky territory in southwestern Utah, they frequently flush tons of silt into the Colorado, which the Paria meets below the dam. The flexible flow plan will remain in effect through 2020. While normal flows through the turbines of the Glen Canyon Dam range from 8,000 to 22,500 cubic feet per second, the high-flow events could reach 45,000 cubic feet per second and last anywhere from one hour to four days. At the highest flow, there is too much water to go through the hydroelectric turbines, and the excess is funneled over the dam. Anne Castle, assistant interior secretary for water and science, said in the news conference that the delivery of power to the six million customers served by the dam would not be significantly affected. The department also announced plans to change its management of nonnative trout in the river. The agency has been killing nonnative trout, which crowd out the humpback chub, at sites along the Colorado. The practice brought protests from American Indian groups, including the Zuni tribe, for whom these areas are sacred, Interior Department officials said. The new plan, described as experimental, instead envisions “live removal” of the trout for restocking in other waters, Ms. Castle said. “We’re trying to understand better the impact of those changes on the nonnative fish that are being removed and on the endangered fish,” she said.",2855
4fd2a9978eb7c8105d894ee3,2012-05-19T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/science/earth/insurance-company-approved-for-land-trusts.html,Environment,"NEW LONDON, Conn. — The $4 million estate on the Connecticut River in Lyme had everything: a six-bedroom home, a pool and a dock, all surrounded by 17 acres of native meadows, brush and woodlands. It also had a decades-old conservation restriction, held by the local land trust, requiring the property to remain largely in its “natural wilderness” state. But after buying the land in 2007, Brian and Beverly Platner went for a more manicured look, installing a sweeping lawn and gardens with sculptured borders. The Lyme Land Conservation Trust was not pleased, and in 2009, it sued to enforce the restrictions, which were adopted in the 1980s. In turn, the Platners sued the trust’s president, accusing him of defaming them. When landowners defy established conservation restrictions — and informal resolution efforts fail — the country’s 1,700 or so land trusts find that they have little option but to take them to court. “Whoever holds the easement has an absolute responsibility to defend it,” said Darla Guenzler, executive director of the California Council of Land Trusts. But some trust officials worry that the litigation costs could ruin their largely volunteer organizations and erode their ability to protect land. The national Land Trust Alliance came up with the idea of creating an insurance company to help trusts with legal costs, and it petitioned the Internal Revenue Service to grant the new company, called Terra Firma, nonprofit status. On Thursday, the I.R.S. approval came through. In East Haddam, Conn., defending one case against a landowner took almost a decade and cost the local trust $415,000, about half of which was covered by insurance. “It nearly brought us to our knees,” said Anita Ballek, a co-founder of the East Haddam Land Trust. The wave of lawsuits is rooted partly in the rapid expansion of the trusts. Many took advantage of bargain prices during the recession and significantly increased their holdings — with the total protected acreage nearly doubling to 47 million acres in the decade ending in 2010, according to a census by the Land Trust Alliance. At the same time, trust officials said they began noticing a new disregard for their covenants, particularly among the wealthy. “It’s unfortunate that this is happening more often,” Leslie Ratley-Beach, the conservation director of the national alliance, said in a recent interview. “But that is something we expected as the land that’s conserved changes hands.” Mobilized by its California members, the alliance began raising money to start the insurance company. So far it has raised $3 million of the $4 million required. Terra Firma will sell policies providing up to $500,000 in legal coverage to 1,000 or more small trusts around the country. Annual premiums for land trusts would be $60 per landholding or easement. More than 460 smaller trusts have already signed up. An exact count of legal challenges around the country is not kept. But a 2009 poll by Adena R. Rissman, an assistant professor of forest and wildlife ecology at the University of Wisconsin, showed that about 47 percent of trusts surveyed had faced a significant legal challenge or easement violation. She found that the average cost of such legal challenges for trusts was $37,700. A Land Trust Alliance fact sheet said that 85 percent of trusts had budgets under $250,000; fewer than 20 had legal defense funds of $70,000 or more. The idea of land trusts dates back a century, but it was after World War II, when housing development surged, that the practice of private groups preserving native landscapes took off. In the past three decades, hundreds of new trusts have been created. Among the incentives for donors of conservation easements are one-time tax deductions. In return, the I.R.S. seeks to ensure that the land is conserved “in perpetuity.” The consequences of breached conservation easements are far reaching, experts say. If too many are abrogated, future proposals may face more skepticism from the tax authorities. Jessica Jay, a Colorado lawyer who founded the firm Conservation Law PC, explained, “It’s just at the point when the easement transfers from the original grantor to a successor that we need to be sure the permanence is there.” There has been a rich variety of other cases. In Washington State, a landowner was jailed briefly last year after he was found to have repeatedly strung zip lines on protected land and sold rides. Near North Carolina’s Cold Mountain, a gravel ford was built over a protected trout stream to simplify access to a neighboring property. New owners of conserved land in Ohio sued the local trust, arguing unsuccessfully that the previous owner was senile when she donated the 28 acres and that they should thus be allowed to build 39 houses there. Land trusts usually win in court — though many cases are settled, according to alliance records. One common denominator: the wealth of the property owners challenging restrictions. In 2001, Timothy Mellon, the owner of the small Goodspeed Airport in East Haddam, cut down 300 trees on conserved wetlands near his runway, according to a judicial ruling in the case. Mr. Mellon, the son of the philanthropist Paul Mellon, argued in court papers that federal aviation laws regarding runway obstacles trumped conservation restrictions. Despite a decade of litigation, his argument did not prevail. Mr. Mellon’s defamation claims against land trust officials were also dismissed. A lawsuit was filed in Vermont involving a conservation easement adjoining a vacation home that Jonathan Rothberg, an entrepreneur and scientific pioneer of rapid genome sequencing, bought near the Harriman reservoir. The Vermont Land Trust’s 2003 suit claimed that 50-foot trees on the conservation easement were cut, improving the home’s view and extending its lawn. Dr. Rothberg and the previous landowner deny cutting protected trees. Dr. Rothberg said he was abiding by an out-of-court settlement. “We stopped mowing the grass, we planted seeds and haven’t heard anything since,” he said. Battles are inevitable, said Annette Lorraine, a lawyer with the Land as Legacy consultants group in Montpelier, Vt. “Even an easement written today with the best knowledge that land trusts have will be challenged, just because some lawyer will tell a client that they can beat this,” she said. In the countersuits over the Platners’ property, neither side is talking. The defamation suit against the Lyme trust’s former president, George Moore, cited his public remark that the Platners “have chosen to disregard the easement and do what they want when they want.” Mr. Moore declined to comment on the case, but the alliance’s 2010 annual report gives his account. The Platners claimed in court papers that the restrictions were invalid and that no “natural and native grasses and vegetation” were there to begin with. Their lawyer, Steve Karlson, said they were overseas and would not discuss the case because settlement talks were under way.",6993
4fd2baa78eb7c8105d8b1685,2012-05-18T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/business/energy-environment/low-natural-gas-prices-threaten-carbon-capture-projects.html,Environment,"WASHINGTON — A federal proposal to ban the construction of coal-fired power plants that release all of their carbon dioxide into the atmosphere would seem to smooth the way for carbon capture, a budding technology that traps the greenhouse gas for storage or other uses. But even as the Environmental Protection Agency prepares to open hearings on the proposed rule, unveiled in March, industry experts say the persistently low price of natural gas is threatening the viability of the nation’s carbon capture projects. Natural gas is so cheap and plentiful that utilities have little incentive to build coal-fired plants with the capture technology. And the proposed rule exempts existing coal- and gas-fired plants. In the tiny universe of American carbon capture projects, the first casualty may be the Taylorville Energy Center, a project in the coal fields of Illinois. The plan was to cook coal into methane, capture the carbon dioxide released in the process, then burn the methane in a conventional natural gas-style power plant. But Taylorville’s backers, unable to persuade the state legislature to approve the project because of its estimated $3.5 billion price, are considering deferring the coal element and simply building the gas-burning plant for one-third the cost. “It’s primarily due to the low natural gas prices, and how that affects the political environment,” said Bart Ford, a vice president of Tenaska, the developer. “We’re not changing the nature of the facility, just deferring the synthetic natural gas portion.” Still, Tenaska is continuing to seek permits to inject carbon dioxide underground at the site, Mr. Ford said. “This allows us to say, we’ll wait until the price impact is lower because the price of natural gas is up,” he said. Making synthetic natural gas from coal makes economic sense only if the ordinary natural gas that it displaces is more expensive. The advent of hydraulic fracturing, a drilling method that has opened vast new supplies of natural gas, has helped to keep gas prices low. The industry’s expectation is that the price will rise somewhat from its current depressed level — near $2 per million B.T.U., compared with as much as $14 before the recession — but that it will not recover fully for many years. Edwardsport, a “capture-ready” Duke Energy coal plant, is scheduled to begin commercial operation this year. The plant, in Edwardsport, Ind., will cook coal into a fuel gas and could be retrofitted to capture carbon dioxide released in that conversion. But Duke, the builder, has no plan to capture the carbon dioxide and no place to sequester it for now. It is exempted from the new rule because construction began five years ago. The plant cost nearly $3 billion to build, about $1 billion over budget, and carbon capture would cost $380 million, not counting storage. Only two other major carbon capture projects are on the drawing boards in the United States. Neither is affected directly by low natural gas prices. But the ebbing interest in coal-fired construction may signal that even if the technology works well, there may be few commercial projects where it could be deployed. One is FutureGen 2.0, a $1.6 billion plan to burn coal in oxygen, generating exhaust gas that is pure carbon dioxide, and pumping it into geologic formations thousands of feet below the earth’s surface. The Recovery Act of 2009 is covering $1 billion of the cost of the project, which is in Meredosia, Ill. But the project, originally expected to be running by 2015, has run into a variety of bureaucratic problems and is now scheduled to be in service in 2017, barring further delays. An earlier version, FutureGen, was rejected by the Energy Department in 2008 to save money. The other venture is the Southern Company’s Kemper County project in Mississippi, which will turn coal into a cleaner gas and use it to power a turbine. The captured carbon dioxide is expected to be sold and travel through a pipeline to Texas, where it will be pumped under ground to force oil out of old oil fields, a process known as enhanced oil recovery. At the moment the market prospects look favorable, given that the price oil drillers will pay for the carbon dioxide depends partly on the price of oil, which is relatively high. But construction is just beginning, so the long-term picture is unclear. The plant is expected to start operating in 2014. Some in the power industry are debating whether the Obama administration’s carbon regulation will be blocked by Congress or a new administration. Still, the absence of a rule would not change the economic equation discouraging investment in capture technology for coal plants. Kelly Ziegler, a spokeswoman for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state consortium on the East Coast that seeks to limit carbon dioxide output, said that no regulation was necessary to stop new coal plants. “Natural gas has already done that for you,” she said. Hearings on the rule are to begin on May 24, and the E.P.A. is taking public comments until June 25. The agency may issue a final rule this year.",5091

Congress decided 25 years ago that the Department of Energy should build a repository for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, a volcanic ridge in Nevada 100 miles from Las Vegas, if the regulatory commission determined the site to be suitable. But the commission decided last year to end its consideration, with the chairman, Gregory B. Jaczko, pointing out that Congress was no longer providing money to advance the project. The Department of Energy had formally moved to withdraw its proposal for the storage site. In his 2008 run for the presidency, President Obama promised to shelve the project, which is bitterly opposed by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada. South Carolina, Washington and several other plaintiffs sued the federal government, arguing that the nuclear commission had a legal responsibility to pass judgment on Yucca. On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard arguments from both sides. “We will never have a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain or elsewhere if the executive does not follow the laws,” said Andrew Fitz, a Washington State assistant attorney general. “The agency chose to abdicate its duty,” he said of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The senior judge on the panel, Merrick B. Garland, reflected on the ambivalent approach taken by Congress. The government is holding about $29 billion collected from utilities for disposal of nuclear waste, but Congress has stopped appropriating the money for that purpose. “Congress is telling us something here,” he said. “They could have said, ‘Take as much as you need to do what we told you to do.’ Instead, they said, ‘Take zero.’ ” Yet the other judges on the panel noted that when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission dropped its licensing process for Yucca Mountain, it still had $10 million for that purpose, and that a new Congress next year could appropriate more money. A lawyer for the commission, Charles E. Mullins, countered that with no prospect that the Energy Department would pursue its application for storage at Yucca Mountain, spending the $10 million would be throwing “good money after bad.” The effort by the Energy Department to withdraw its license application led to a legal morass. The commission’s three-judge licensing panel said the department could not withdraw it, and the commission itself deadlocked on the issue, 2 to 2. The commission’s chairman, Dr. Jaczko, halted the licensing process nonetheless. He is a former aide to Senator Reid.",2879

McClendon, broke his silence on Wednesday after two weeks of media revelations about his byzantine financial dealings, but he expressed no remorse for anything except the distraction caused by the publicity. Shares of the natural gas drilling company closed down 14.6 percent. Mr. McClendon said he fully supported the move by the company’s board on Tuesday to strip him of his chairmanship and terminate an unusual compensation plan that had granted him a minority stake in every well that Chesapeake drilled. But he declined to address mounting assertions of conflicts of interest involving his personal finances and those of the company — including a report by Reuters on Wednesday that Mr. McClendon had overseen a hedge fund that traded commodities, including natural gas futures, for at least four years while he led Chesapeake’s vast expansion of gas drilling. “There has been enormous and unprecedented scrutiny of our company and me personally,” Mr. McClendon said in a conference call with securities analysts to discuss the company’s dismal first-quarter earnings. “And a great deal of misinformation has been published and uncertainty created. Your mother told you not to believe everything you read or hear for good reason.” Mr. McClendon did not try to correct the record. And the analysts asked no questions about his personal finances, focusing almost entirely on the disappointing $71 million loss reported by the company and on its reduced expectations for future production of oil and natural gas liquids. Mr. McClendon and the company, which he has led for more than two decades, have been under fire since reports emerged two weeks ago that he had borrowed as much as $1.1 billion to finance his stakes in company wells, and that those loans came from financial institutions that also had business dealings with Chesapeake. On Wednesday, he insisted that his compensation package “has always aligned my interests with the company’s interests.” The loans, which the company did not disclose to shareholders until after the news reports, raised concerns among some analysts and investors that Chesapeake’s board was failing to properly oversee the activities of its chairman. Those concerns were heightened by the latest Reuters report, which said that Mr. McClendon and another Chesapeake co-founder had directed a $200 million hedge fund that traded the same commodities produced by his company. The fund, the Heritage Management Company, operated from at least 2004 to 2008. It used Chesapeake’s Oklahoma City headquarters as its mailing address, and a Chesapeake accountant handled its finances. While managing the hedge fund, Mr. McClendon was also overseeing his company’s hedging activities in oil and gas futures, Reuters reported. “It raises questions about his business relationships, especially since it wasn’t disclosed,” said Andrew Lipow, a former Amoco trader and Houston consultant. As a natural gas producer, he added, “you might have positions that you are entering into or exiting from, and meanwhile you have another company that is trading at the same time.” Chesapeake declined to comment on whether the board had been told about the hedge fund. A person with knowledge of the fund insisted that there had been no conflict of interest. “Aubrey and Heritage were always long, and Chesapeake was always long on gas, too, even as we hedge to reduce risk,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the possibility of shareholder litigation over the disclosures of Mr. McClendon’s business dealings. A bet that is long is a bet that an asset will rise in price. Commodities markets are more loosely regulated than equity markets, and insider trading in commodities is not considered illegal unless there is price manipulation. But some Wall Street analysts said they were troubled by at least the appearance of a conflict of interest, and that the hedge fund must have been a time-consuming distraction for Mr. McClendon while he was running Chesapeake. “If he knows Chesapeake is going to ramp up or curtail production, he could enter into positions in his hedge fund that could benefit from that,” said Mark Hanson, a Morningstar analyst. “It’s going to be part of an ongoing litany of things he is going to face.”",4332

No new technology is needed to prevent a repetition, only stricter adherence to operating rules, the investigators suggested in a 151-page report. The failures were “pretty basic things,” said David R. Nevius, senior vice president of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which is designated by the federal government to assure grid reliability and investigated the blackout in tandem with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Still, the investigation revealed new vulnerabilities in the grid. For example, electric companies are supposed to routinely analyze anticipated conditions for the next day. But the Imperial Irrigation District, an electric utility in the Imperial Valley east of San Diego, issued analyses that showed weather, load and generation forecasts but failed to evaluate the underlying power flows, the report said. Just as in 2003, some utility operators also failed to maintain updated computer models of all the electric system’s components, which help them identify vulnerabilities. The blackout began on Sept. 8 when a 500-kilovolt east-west transmission line, the Hassayampa-North Gila, failed. A technician was trying to isolate some of the equipment so he could test it and skipped several steps, which led to a short circuit and a shutdown of the line. Electric grids are supposed to be set up so that no single failure will cause a cascading blackout, by shifting the location of electricity generation in a way that reduces the load on transmission lines. But on that day, because of the way that operators had configured the system, the single failure was enough to cause a blackout at 3:38 p.m. The blackout affected 2.7 million customers — probably about 9 million people — from San Diego to the Imperial Valley to Baja California. It all but shut down San Diego’s airport and caused traffic jams as drivers tried to navigate roads without stoplights. Power was restored to most areas within 12 hours. The blackout’s scope could have been limited if operators had been trained to intentionally cut off some areas, the investigators reported. As with the Eastern blackout in 2003, system operators had only poor knowledge of what was happening in neighboring systems, which prevented them from taking proper action until it was too late, their report said. After the original transmission-line failure, power flowed over parallel paths and overloaded some of them, causing a cascading failure. That cut power to the two-reactor San Onofre nuclear power station, which responded by shutting down, adding to the system’s instability. A second problem emerged with automatic disconnect systems that are intended to protect power lines, generating stations and transformers from damage, the report said. While some of that equipment helped the system by protecting components from overheating, investigators said, some it may have operated too early, guaranteeing a cascade. Disconnects on hair-trigger settings also contributed to the 2003 blackout in the East. Stephen Berberich, the chief executive of the California Independent System Operator Corporation, which runs the grid in most of California, told reporters in a conference call that “we’re going to do as much as we can” to improve computer modeling of the Western grid and coordination between adjacent “risk areas.” Like the Eastern blackout, the problem was not a shortage of generating capacity or transmission, the investigators emphasized. But when the first line failed, other components became overloaded. While the report made clear standards had been violated, potential penalties will be taken up by the agencies separately.",3927

McClendon built Chesapeake Energy into the nation’s second-largest producer of natural gas through a combination of debt, foresight, luck and sheer bravado. Now both he and the company have been forced to add humility to the mix. After two weeks of mounting shareholder criticism about Mr. McClendon’s unusual compensation plan, Chesapeake announced on Tuesday that it would replace him as chairman and prematurely end an arrangement that granted him the right to buy a 2.5 percent stake in every well the company drilled. Hours later, the company reported disappointing first-quarter earnings and said it would further scale back its gas drilling plans amid a continued glut that Chesapeake’s own aggressive expansion helped create. Mr. McClendon will remain chief executive of Chesapeake, which is based in Oklahoma City, but the board said it would seek to appoint a nonexecutive chairman with no ties to the company, a separation of power urged by many shareholders. And his right to buy into Chesapeake’s wells, known as the Founder Well Participation Program, will be terminated on June 30, 2014 — 18 months ahead of schedule and without any compensation to him for giving up the privilege. “For him, it’s got to be at least a slap in the face because he is losing some of his control,” said Philip H. Weiss, an analyst with Argus Research, who questioned why the compensation arrangement wasn’t ending sooner. Mr. McClendon, who is the most public face of the shale gas drilling boom and a vocal proponent for switching the country’s electricity production from coal to gas, is a co-founder of Chesapeake and the only chief it has ever had. Under his 24 years of stewardship, Chesapeake acquired drilling rights on more than 15 million acres around the country — roughly equivalent to the size of West Virginia — and drilled tens of thousands of wells. (Exxon Mobil is the No. 1 producer.) But as details of Mr. McClendon’s compensation structure trickled out in news reports over the last two weeks, shareholders and analysts made it clear to the board that the setup, which had been in place for many years, was no longer acceptable. In particular, investors were uncomfortable with the potential conflicts posed by his vast borrowing from investment firms that did business with Chesapeake — an amount the company disclosed at $846 million — to finance his share of drilling expenses. In a sign of the shareholder pressure, Chesapeake included a statement from Southeastern Asset Management, an activist investment firm in Memphis that is its biggest investor, in announcing the changes. “We are pleased that the board listened to our input and believe it has made the right decision by ending the F.W.P.P. early and seeking an independent chairman,” O. Mason Hawkins, Southeastern’s chairman and chief, said in the statement. “Aubrey was right to recognize that these actions are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.” Southeastern had a 17 percent stake in the company at the end of last year and backed the appointment of Louis A. Simpson, a former chief executive of Geico, as a director. The biggest share of Mr. McClendon’s loans came from EIG Global Energy Partners, which has also invested in Chesapeake wells. Other lenders included Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Critics of Mr. McClendon have said that the crisscrossing relationships gave at least the appearance of conflicts of interest since he could conduct Chesapeake business with those firms on preferential terms in exchange for favored treatment on his personal loans. The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an informal investigation, and the company disclosed Monday that the Internal Revenue Service was reviewing the compensation plan. Negotiations between Chesapeake’s board and Mr. McClendon began last Thursday, according to people briefed on the matter. Company directors were afraid of arousing further shareholder ire. Yet they also sought to keep him from departing. In the end, the board agreed to keep the program until mid-2014, allowing Mr. McClendon to buy stakes in new shale oil and gas fields in Ohio, Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle that Chesapeake plans to drill over the next year that most experts say they believe will be lucrative. This year was not the first time that shareholders expressed concerns about Mr. McClendon’s compensation. The board said it paid him nearly $17.9 million last year in salary, stock awards and other compensation, a 15 percent decline from the year before, after shareholder complaints. Installing an independent chairman was also not a new idea. New York State’s pension fund initially called for a vote on such a move early last year, though it withdrew the proposal after voicing its complaints with Chesapeake’s lead director. Michael D. Kehs, a Chesapeake spokesman, said that by establishing an independent chairman, “what we are adopting here is a gold standard for corporate governance.” He said the I.R.S. audit of Mr. McClendon’s compensation package was part of an overall audit of the company’s 2007 and 2008 returns that began in late 2009. Investors welcomed the board and compensation moves, sending Chesapeake’s shares up 6 percent in regular trading. But the stock gave up most of those gains in after-hours trading as investors digested the company’s dismal financial results, released after the market close. Chesapeake reported a loss of $71 million, or 11 cents a share, for the first quarter, compared with a loss of $205 million in the year-ago quarter. Daily company production of oil and natural gas liquids like ethane used in the manufacture of petrochemicals was higher, and production of lower-priced gas as a percentage of total production continued to fall. But the average natural gas price earned by the company declined to $2.35 per thousand cubic feet in the first quarter, from $5.31 a year ago. Natural gas represented 81 percent of the company’s production, but only 48 percent of its revenue. Some Wall Street analysts said the company’s problems were not over. “There’s probably more yet to be discovered,” said Mark Hanson, an energy stock analyst at Morningstar. “It looks like the board has been roused from its slumber.” A spokesman for Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York comptroller, said in a statement that the state pension fund planned to withhold votes for the company’s directors. “The fund believes that there needs to be an infusion of new and independent board members,” the spokesman, Eric Sumberg, said.",6559

 Whisky and butter tarts, Syrian cooking and a Japanese-Italian menu: Canada’s food scene is as textured and diverse as its population. Our Food section this week is devoted to some of the pleasures of Canadian cuisine. As the country grapples with a troubled past, a new generation of cooks and scholars is reclaiming and spreading the cuisine of its ancestors. A dolled-up setting for Italian food with Japanese influences is part of a respectful revival in the city’s Chinatown. With its flaky pastry, caramelized crust and bracingly sweet filling, the butter tart has it all. Recipes: Butter Tarts | Butter Tart Squares Interest in all kinds of whiskeys has spurred a new wave of distilleries, and a renewed respect for a distinctive spirit. Butter tarts, tourtière and maple pies, breads and venison: some of our favorite recipes from Canada. Though better known for ice wines, the regions near Lake Ontario produce gorgeous dry wines, and their potential is only beginning to be explored. This snappy mix of vodka, spices and Clamato is widely regarded as the national cocktail, and is still making inroads. Recipe: Caesar Cocktail This already diverse city has welcomed thousands of Syrians and their cooking, supporting a small boom in food businesses. Want more coverage from Canada?

UPDATED December 20, 2017
 
 Arguably, 2017 was the year of the multicooker. Anything Instant Pot was popular with readers of the Food section. In January, Melissa Clark tried one (that article is No. 2 on this list), and in the fall, she shared more recipes for it (No. 6). But two articles, published in mid-December, became late additions to the list, as they reported on inappropriate sexual behavior in the restaurant world. What follows is the most-read Food stories and columns in 2017, along with some of the most popular reader comments. In September, our dining critic crossed the Hudson River, and named Razza Pizza Artigianale in Jersey City home to the region’s best pizza, citing a sauce “which is less acidic and bitter than many, and about as sweet as possible without tasting sugary.” Local ingredients like a buffalo mozzarella made from Sussex County water buffaloes helped, too. Five of Daniel Boulud’s sommeliers held a dinner this year to counter enduring wine shibboleths. Among them? The proper temperature to serve wine and fixations on fine vintages. “I was drawn to this dinner because, as with anyone who writes or talks about wine regularly, I am intimately familiar with all sorts of widely held yet mistaken notions,” our wine critic said. “They are worth discussing, as these fallacies can be significant barriers to getting the most pleasure out of drinking wine.” Before she joined The New York Times Magazine as an Eat columnist, Ms. Nosrat was extolling the importance of proper seasoning in the Food section. This article, an excerpt from her book “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking,” covered the three main kinds of salt and the nuances of salting. Recipes: Buttermilk-Marinated Roast Chicken | Caesar Salad From her small, idiosyncratic restaurant in Freedom, Me., Ms. French has found success and a cult following with her own approach: open, intimate and personal. Recipes: Halibut Niçoise | Chilled Golden Beet and Buttermilk Soup Vegetarianism and veganism are on on the rise; and kale, the bacon of the clean-eating moment, is now routinely heaped on salad plates across the land. Products and ideas surrounding eating, health and wellness that seem like a 1970s flashback have gone mainstream. Recipe: Pan-Griddled Sweet Potatoes With Miso-Ginger Sauce In July, the ice cream brand joined the list of food companies that are grappling with trace amounts of glyphosate in their products. The herbicide is the main ingredient in the popular consumer pesticide Roundup, which is widely used in agriculture. After the chef Sean Brock went to rehab, he came back with a new mission: teaching people in the restaurant business how to ask for help. “Suffering is suffering,” Mr. Brock said. “It doesn’t matter if you are addicted to porn on the internet or you’re codependent or you’re addicted to gambling or if you’re addicted to ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta.’ You’re suffering, and that’s what gets us into trouble.” Earlier this month the celebrity chef Mario Batali, one of the country’s most high-profile restaurateurs, announced he was  stepping away from the daily operations of his businesses and the daytime program he co-hosts on ABC, “The Chew,” amid allegations of sexual misconduct. When Jack Daniel’s faltered on its vow to honor Nearest Green, a slave distiller who taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey, Fawn Weaver sprang into action. “It was jarring that arguably one of the most well-known brands in the world was created, in part, by a slave,” said Ms. Weaver, an African-American real estate investor and author. A multicooker is dinnertime convenience in stainless steel form — an appliance that combines an electric pressure cooker with a slow cooker, electric steamer and rice cooker — and for our Good Appetite columnist, there is no other single gadget that can make weeknight cooking easier. Recipes: Pressure Cooker Sticky Tamarind Baby Back Ribs | Pressure Cooker Coconut Curry Chicken | How to Use an Instant Pot This blueprint for cooking an entire Thanksgiving meal over the course of one day in an oven and on four burners above it proved to be very popular with readers. A technique that creates thin chocolate chip cookies, with crisp ripples that run to the edges, finds Instagram fame. Recipe: Giant Crinkled Chocolate Chip Cookies Julia Moskin and Kim Severson spent months interviewing former employees of Ken Friedman, the owner of the Spotted Pig, a West Village restaurant helmed by the chef April Bloomfield. The women said that Mr. Friedman had subjected them to unwanted sexual advances: groping them in public, demanding sex or making text requests for nude pictures or group sex. Within hours of the article’s publication, his company announced that Mr. Friedman had decided to take an indefinite leave of absence from the management of the restaurants. The electric pressure cooker is the kitchen gadget of the moment. In January, Melissa Clark looked at what it does (and doesn’t do) well. Recipes: Pressure Cooker Chocolate Pudding | Pressure Cooker Spicy Pork Shoulder | Pressure Cooker Beef Short Ribs With Red Wine and Chile | Pressure Cooker Pork Salad With Pomelo and Garlic Chips | More Pressure Cooker Recipes Julia Moskin, Melissa Clark and Sam Sifton reviewed all-beef hot dogs this summer.

DEC. 12, 2017
 
 Each December as I choose my favorite new restaurants of the year, I go slightly bonkers trying to find patterns. It must be a side effect of writing criticism on a weekly deadline, which forces me to focus on the task at hand. When I step back to look at the big picture in 12 months’ worth of reviews, my eyes have trouble adjusting to the light. The trouble is that my weekly column is far from a scientific survey. And my year-end list is boxed in by self-imposed rules. (Restaurants that opened late in 2016 but got reviewed this year were eligible, while very new places that I haven’t written about yet weren’t.) So any patterns I might discern are unlikely to have statistical significance. Still, I look for meaning. Does it say anything, for instance, that women are the chefs at four of the 10 new restaurants I’m most excited about? Is it a sign that the restaurant business is becoming more diverse when only three places on my list have chefs who were born in the United States? That the rest come from China, Mexico, Thailand, Chile, South Korea and Uruguay? What about No. 2 on my list, Guan Fu Sichuan, the first Chinese restaurant in decades to be given three stars by The New York Times — as far as I can tell, the last was Say Eng Look, reviewed by Mimi Sheraton in 1982 — is that an indication that China’s economic strength is going to work out to the advantage of eaters in New York? Whether these restaurants will turn out to be forerunners of lasting changes, I don’t know. My list of favorites is subjective, obviously. It reflects my preferences and nothing else. And the restaurant business is still a very, very long way from giving the same opportunities to everybody who applies. If there’s doubt about that, look at No. 1: the Grill, inside one of the two most beautiful restaurant spaces in the city. The other is the Pool, and the landlord essentially handed both directly to three already successful American-born men. These men, who run the Major Food Group, started with huge advantages. They also took on an extraordinarily complex project and further complicated it by setting their sights very high. And the result, in my eyes, is a restaurant that is extremely enjoyable in all sorts of ways. This is why peering into the crystal ball makes me cross-eyed. What I do know is that the best restaurants I reviewed this year, ranked below in order of my enthusiasm for them, are an interesting and diverse crop, with something for adventure-seekers and traditionalists, chile-heads and more cautious palates. Best of all, there are a lot of fresh voices in this list. I’ll give up on prognostication now; it’s time instead for celebration. The restaurateurs in the Major Food Group understand the theater of dining, and what to do with it, as well as anyone. They inherited two of the best stages in New York when they took over the former Four Seasons, and while they haven’t yet figured out how they can fully inhabit the old Pool Room, they’ve brought out the inherent drama of Philip Johnson’s Grill Room design to make a restaurant that’s relentlessly entertaining. From the oversize menus to the servers’ patter to the often outlandish prices, everything is slightly exaggerated, like the gestures of actors trying to reach the back row. Borrowing from American and Continental cuisine of the 1960s, the chef, Mario Carbone, has hit upon a style that’s both showy and substantial. Prime rib, carved tableside by a specialist who does nothing else, gets a whole smoked beef rib in a mustard rub as a garnish, which beats a parsley sprig. The elementally pure crab cake is made without breading; the top crust is a rosette of browned potato coins. The Grill has flaws, including the expense and the undercurrent of hustle, but it shares them with other restaurants. Its best qualities are all its own. 99 East 52nd Street (Lexington Avenue), Midtown; 212-375-9001; thegrillnewyork.com. New York hardly suffers from a scarcity of good mapo tofu and Chongqing chicken. But the depth, complexity and finesse of the cooking at Guan Fu stand out. It’s probably the most cheffy Sichuan place in town, although that claim would be easier to support if Guan Fu’s owners didn’t refuse to name the chef in question. Whoever is in charge has some skills. The boiled fish with pickled vegetables, the “homemade” roasted fish, and the mapo tofu hold your attention with layer after layer of flavor, and only some of those layers come from chiles. Capsaicin freaks will want to test their strength against the cuttlefish in a charred green chile sauce that only looks harmless. The service, while not quite seamless, is gracious and solicitous, and the décor — wood paneling, gilded ceilings, padded seats wide enough for two — point to the new money trickling into Flushing.  39-16 Prince Street (39th Avenue), Flushing, Queens; 347-610-6999; guanfuny.com. If you walk in expecting the cuisine of Mexico, Empellón’s menu may leave you angry, disgruntled or confused. It’s Mexican cooking in the sense that Miles Davis’s “Sketches of Spain” is Spanish music: some of it is, the rest is made up, and somehow it all fits beautifully together. Even the tacos, not quite convincing initially despite their tacolike appearance, are better now and no longer usher you into food’s uncanny valley. Alex Stupak’s earlier Empellóns weren’t necessarily meant for everybody, but this one has a big Midtown space to fill; it needs to please crowds. That seems to have liberated him to make his plates more bright and colorful. He’s still a technical wizard, but the weird tricks he pulls now are almost always fun, like the platter of nachos under a scribble of a sea urchin-butter sauce that looks like melted Velveeta.  510 Madison Avenue, Midtown; 212-858-9365; empellon.com. Occasionally I suspect that I and everyone else involved in the local restaurant scene have lost our minds. The next time that feeling takes hold, I’ll go to King. Everything there makes sense. The cocktails are straightforward little stress-reducers, just complicated enough to get your attention. The little square dining room looks exactly like a place to eat. The chefs, Clare de Boer and Jess Shadbolt, make a compelling case for bringing back the kind of refined-rustic seasonal cooking drawn from southern France and northern Italy that many young chefs have turned their backs on. Their cooking is a marvel of attentiveness and balance. 18 King Street (Avenue of the Americas), SoHo; 917-825-1618; kingrestaurant.nyc. A great restaurant anywhere on the Upper East Side is newsworthy. But Flora Bar happens to make glorious use of the bottom floor of the Met Breuer museum, a brutalist landmark that grows more impressive the more closely you look. (The view is of Marcel Breuer’s naked-concrete moat and drawbridge off Madison Avenue.) Ignacio Mattos, the Uruguay-born chef of Estela and Café Altro Paradiso, does his most refined cooking here; the food, like caviar on a thin, unfolded omelet, is elegant and sumptuous. Even the radicchio shimmers.  Inside the Met Breuer, 945 Madison Avenue (East 75th Street), Upper East Side; 646-558-5383; florabarnyc.com. Victoria Blamey lasted just over a year as chef, but by the time she left early this month she had established herself as a chef worth following. And she did it at Chumley’s, the revivified speakeasy where just about everybody drank at one time or another in the past, and where just about nobody remembered eating. Ms. Blamey cooked tavern food never before seen in any tavern on this planet, like a double cheeseburger basted in bone marrow, or a warm pretzel and trout roe with onion dip so well-made it seemed like a hallucination. And then there were uncategorizable inventions like the Dungeness crab potpie, loosely inspired by an abalone dish from Chile, where Ms. Blamey grew up. The interior was brand new, its nostalgia carefully stage-managed and somewhat cloying, but with food like that and a cocktail or two, it didn’t matter.  86 Bedford Street (Barrow Street), West Village; 212-675-2081; chumleysnewyork.com. Atla is the second restaurant opened, after Cosme, by the chefs Daniela Soto-Innes and Enrique Olvera. Ms. Soto-Innes runs both kitchens but seems especially attached to Atla, and she’s filled the menu with things that the kind of New Yorkers who have time for breakfast in NoHo want to eat. Mornings and afternoons bring enchiladas and other things you might eat at a fonda in Mexico City, where Ms. Soto-Innes lived until she was 12. Alongside these are salads and bowls, as at any robustly hashtagged American cafe: cinnamon-rich chia pudding, guacamole with goat cheese on toast. The dinner menu strolls in after 5, but it’s just as pleasant and untaxing. Cosme is more groundbreaking and self-consciously modern, but Atla feels more contemporary.  372 Lafayette Street (Great Jones Street), NoHo; atlanyc.com. Raised in Seoul, Junghyun Park has a knack for drawing out Korean cuisine’s less extroverted flavors and giving them a little twist. Sea-bass tartare might appear under a soft green layer of kiwi dressed with pickled garlic and fresh mint; coins of octopus dotted with parsley oil may be surrounded by a ring of chopped kimchi and chorizo. Three dishes along those lines plus a bowl of rice will cost $39, not at all bad for such original cooking. Mr. Park’s wife, Ellia, oversees the dining room, setting a gracious and unfussy tone that puts you in the mood to relax and explore.  43 East 28th Street (Park Avenue), NoMad; 646-476-7217; atoboynyc.com. This exciting evocation of Yunnanese cuisine is the project of a chef born in a different Chinese province, Sichuan. Simone Tong has a wonderful feeling for the fresh vibrancy of Yunnan, building up tension with salty, hot, sour and sweet ingredients, most of them local stand-ins. Her tribute to a street snack from Dali, a backpacker mecca, uses local purple potatoes and curds from Beecher’s Handmade Cheese, off Union Square. The main event is mixian, the long, slender, elusively slippery rice noodle; their mild flavor defers to the fireworks of Ms. Tong’s broths. Service is included in the prices, which don’t go above $15.  177 First Avenue (East 11th Street), East Village; 929-367-8664; littletong.com. One dish, a dry curry from southern Thailand in which chiles are permanently fused with beef, is marked “brutally spicy” on the menu. Another, a northern Thai duck larb, isn’t, but should be. The rest of the food at Ugly Baby is more forgiving, but none of it is compromising: the chef, Sirichai Sreparplarn, is intent on giving Brooklyn an accurate taste of his native country’s cooking. Servers aren’t always reliable guides to what’s hot and what’s not. The best strategy is to order as much as possible, then go on a tour of the table.  407 Smith Street (Fourth Street), Carroll Gardens; 347-689-3075; uglybabynyc.com.

 The following items — eight dishes, one pastry and a cocktail — all reside in New York establishments that did not make the list of my favorite new restaurants of the year for one reason or another. Some come from places that aren’t eligible because they’re too old, or that were nudged out by other new restaurants I was more enthusiastic about. A few are standouts from restaurants I’ve decided not to review just yet. And one comes from a bakery. When I close my eyes, I can see each one hopping up and down, waving, calling out, “Choose me! Choose me!” To get them to pipe down, I’ve rounded them all up in one place, in no particular order. It’s rare that I remember a pot of mussels the next morning, let alone months later. But the mussels at Grant Achatz’s hideaway lounge are an event, from their first appearance in an antique tureen to the final smudge of a bacon-infiltrated cream sauce that you wipe away with a rag of bread ($35). In the Mandarin Oriental New York, 80 Columbus Circle (60th Street), Upper West Side; 212-805-8800; theofficenyc.tocktix.com. A distant cousin of pommes Anna, these are little stacks of very thinly sliced potatoes fried in beef fat. The crunch-to-volume ratio is admirably high ($11). 375 Amsterdam Avenue (West 78th Street), Upper West Side; 212-362-8731; whitegoldbutchers.com. Pale yellow, fluffy, soft and having no thought on its mind other than your happiness, the polenta is this restaurant’s golden retriever. Though it’s easy enough to share, try to eat it alone, ideally on a wet night when there’s an empty seat at the bar ($17). 101 East 19th Street (Park Avenue), Gramercy Park; 212-243-4020; unionsquarecafe.com. A Malaysian favorite that arrives trailing smoke and builds to an intense, lingering impact, thanks to a rub of chiles and fermented shrimp paste ($38). 207 Second Avenue (East 13th Street), East Village; 212-254-3500; ssambar.momofuku.com. The bakery opened in 2016, so this item is more of an ICYMI, but I did MI until this spring. The choux are vanilla-cream-filled pastry puffs with a surprise on the outside: a crackled, sugary cookie coating ($3.25). 28 Greenwich Avenue (West 10th Street), Greenwich Village; 212-498-9810; mahzedahrbakery.com. Pan pizza isn’t what New York is famous for, and the grandma style had mostly escaped the attention of chefs until Dan Kluger gave it a respectful spin and a crust that’s airier and more flavorful than usual ($16). 21 West Eighth Street (Fifth Avenue), Greenwich Village; 212-388-1831; loringplacenyc.com. A classic savory crepe, spread with herb yogurt and rolled up, becomes the pedestal for lobe after lobe of creamy sea urchin. Like all worthwhile luxuries, its secret is simplicity ($14). 930 Fulton Street (St. James Place), Clinton Hill, Brooklyn; 917-909-1889; otwaynyc.com. If this drink — essentially an absinthe daiquiri — had been available to van Gogh, he might have been more cheerful, although it probably wouldn’t have helped his financial state ($18). 99 East 52nd Street (Lexington Avenue), Midtown; 212-375-9001; thepoolnewyork.com. The hummus is green because the chickpeas are picked before they get starchy and white, and also because they went into the blender with handfuls of fresh Thai basil ($15). 38 East 19th Street (Broadway), Flatiron; 212-475-5829; abchome.com/eat/abcv. To the drawerful of spices that go into any biryani, Sahib adds yogurt and milk before sealing up the rice under a lid of pastry. The recipe comes from Lucknow, and it’s a treat ($17). 104 Lexington Avenue (East 27th Street), Kips Bay; 646-590-0994; sahibny.com. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

 The places to eat that I like best are imperfect. They might have unsteady tables and bony chairs, set too close together, and doors that don’t shut properly, letting in every hiss of wind. They might keep erratic hours, close early without warning and never answer the phone. A dish might touch heaven on one visit and fall to earth the next. What they give me is something more: entry not only to a cuisine, but also to a part of the city I wouldn’t otherwise have a chance to know. I wish there were room here to include all the places that surprised me this year: A Bhutanese snooker hall. A Cuban ventanita (coffee window). A Brooklyn pizzeria whose true specialty is Egyptian feteer (a many-layered crepe), and a Bronx pizzeria whose true specialty is Albanian burek (phyllo pie). An Ethiopian restaurant that doubles as a temple to street art. A Korean-Uzbek restaurant serving fernbrake under crystal lights. Maybe the only Burmese restaurant in town. Everywhere I went, I was welcomed, and made to feel that this was my part of the city, too. Below, in descending order, are the places that taught me the most in 2017. This is the world, in a sprawl of stalls. No food hall or open-air food market in New York can match it: not its breadth, generosity or giddy sense of revelation. On any given night, you may find Malaysian burgers warm with curry, sheathed in a half-scramble of egg; Bolivian beef-heart skewers, all smoky tenderness; Persian tahdig, rice scraped nearly burnt from the bottom of the pot (the best part); Nigerian jollof rice under luxurious efo (spinach stew), shining plantains and pepper chicken; and my favorite, kue pancong, Indonesian coconut cakes shaped like moons with dark seas of hand-torched palm sugar. John Wang, the Texas-born son of Taiwanese immigrants, founded the market in 2015 with a mission to find vendors “from every country represented” in the city. His most important directive: No dish can cost over $6, with almost all $5 or less. They’re snacks, not entrees, which means you can eat more of them. Queens Night Market (open seasonally, currently closed), 47-01 111th Street (47th Avenue), Corona, Queens; queensnightmarket.com. All the stars must align to lead you to Warung Selasa, which is open only one day a week (Selasa, or Tuesday), from 1 to 8 p.m., and hidden in the back of an Indonesian grocery. Warung is the word for the ramshackle food spots tucked under tarps along Indonesia’s roadsides, and this one is almost as rudimentary, with a lone table leaning against a freezer. There, the chef, Anastasia Dewi Tjahjadi, might take a seat across from you, reminisce about her youth in Surabaya in East Java and give you a gentle schooling in the complexities of Indonesian cooking. Each Tuesday’s menu consists of a single dish, an ever-changing collage of sour, salt, sweet and forthright funk, accompanied by sambal with enough heat to crack the mind open. Warung Selasa at Indo Java, 8512 Queens Boulevard (Grand Avenue), Elmhurst, Queens; 718-779-2241; no website. “Don’t tell anyone” is Mei Lee’s hushed admonition to customers at her modest restaurant, which follows its own rules and measures of time, and might not be able (or willing) to accommodate hordes of new fans. Nevertheless, Ms. Lee deserves them, for her sincere renditions of Taiwanese xiao chi (small eats), such as lion’s head meatballs, shaggy giants softened up by hours of braising until they practically shrug themselves apart, and an omelet seasoned by nothing but preserved turnip, its salt delicate but insistent, like a whisper. Ms. Lee, who has family roots in northern China, grew up in South Korea; Taiwanese is her adopted cuisine, learned at college in Taipei, where she met her husband. Every night he stops by the restaurant to help her clean up, and then, she said, “We close the door and walk home together.” Mama Lee, 213-12 48th Avenue (Bell Boulevard), Bayside, Queens; 718-767-8680, no website. This onetime fish-and-chips shop, freed of its bulletproof fiberglass, is still geared primarily for takeout, with no restroom for customers and only a couple of high tables. But there’s a distinct artistry to the Filipino dishes (none over $12), presented in compostable bowls lined with banana leaves. The chef, Aniceto Reña Jr. (known as J.R.), came to the United States at age 11 from Cebu City in the Philippines. After stints in high-end kitchens, he’s returned to the food of his heritage, approaching it at a slant: A Filipino snack of Campbell’s cream of mushroom soup poured over beef tongue is transformed by a foam of cold-smoked mushroom stock, and pancit (noodles) come buried under shorn leaves of brussels sprouts, curling garlic scapes and a flurry of cured yolk. Tama, 147 Lewis Avenue (Lafayette Avenue), Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn; 347-533-4750; tamarestaurant.com Long before Filipino food entered the American mainstream, Filipino restaurants were quietly thriving in enclaves around the country. In 2006, Mario Albenio (known as Boyet), a native of Tacurong on the southern island of Mindanao, opened Tito Rad’s a few blocks shy of Little Manila in Woodside, Queens. His menu offers unabashed comfort, in grand boomerangs of tuna jaw leaking smoke from the grill; taro leaves soused on coconut milk; bitter melon, bracing and uncompromised; and goat unshackling its muscles after a simmer with green olives and liver pâté. Raucous birthday parties occasionally overrun the back room, passing slices of cake to surrounding tables; refuse at your own risk. Tito Rad’s Grill, 49-10 Queens Boulevard (49th Street), Woodside, Queens; 718-205-7299; titorads.com. At a counter in the back of a cramped bodega, the faithful gather for the dispensing of coctél de mariscos, shrimp and octopus boiled with salt and submerged in a luminous red liquid that is only partly explained as crushed tomatoes, onions, clam juice and lime. (The rest is secret.) Pedro Rodriguez, the chef, left Mexico City nearly three decades ago to make a life in the United States, working as a painter and carpenter before setting up a sidewalk stand in 2012 to sell his seafood tonics. He has since moved indoors (although the stand reappears on weekends), where diners perch on benches, crumbling saltines into their cocktails and squeezing imposing bottles of Valentina hot sauce. The menu has grown to encompass tacos, bright lime-slaked ceviche and empanadas with seams cautiously pried open after frying, so that crescents of fresh avocado can be slipped in. La Esquina del Camarón Mexicano, 80-02 Roosevelt Avenue (80th Street), Jackson Heights, Queens; 347-885-2946; no website. In 1978, when John Nguyen was 4 years old, his family fled Vietnam and found succor among fellow refugees in Orange County, Calif. His mother was a southerner, Saigon-born, and his father a northerner, from outside Hanoi. At Hanoi House, Mr. Nguyen looks to the north. There may not be a darker, lusher pho in New York than his pho bac, unequivocally animal from an all-night bout of marrow bones, neck bones and oxtail bones raving in a pot. The broth is lucent but heavy, refusing to release the tongue. Some may find the pho too strong, in which case there are supernally buoyant spring rolls, crackly and chewy at once; bun cha with charred meatballs wrapped in betel leaves, their smoke possessing the broth; and bo luc lac, filet mignon under a gloss of honey, soy and butter, sweet and salt setting aside their differences and making peace. Hanoi House, 119 St. Marks Place (Avenue A), East Village; 212-995-5010; hanoihousenyc.com. Margarita Brito has been cooking “all her life,” she said — and for the public since 1992, when she and her mother, Reyna Prospero, also called Margarita, stationed a Dominican food truck across the street from P.S. 130 in the Bronx. After Ms. Prospero died in the 2001 crash of American Airlines Flight 587, on her way home to Santo Domingo, Ms. Brito kept the truck alive in her memory. Now, at this bare-bones, mostly takeout shop, she continues to feed the neighborhood alcapurrias, dark fritters of mashed green bananas and plantains, with eggshell-fine crusts and a chewy underlay yielding to cloudlike interiors; and pastelillos, empanadas in full surrender to butter, the dough flaking as if ready to snow. Newer offerings include albóndigas, meatballs turned luscious in a stew of tomatoes and sofrito, and nubs of pork burnished and worthy of trading like coins, alongside tostones that rank among the city’s best. Margarita’s, 915 Avenue Saint John (Prospect Avenue), Longwood, the Bronx; 347-270-5541; no website. Playground was once a karaoke bar, and even at an early hour, the black-and-red dining room still has a slouchy, late-night feel. The chef, Sudarat Yingyong, known as Sue, cooked alongside her husband, Sompoch Siribongkoch, until he died three years ago. She was born in Bangkok but her family comes from the Isan region of northeastern Thailand, which is the menu’s beating heart. Nothing is understated, nothing held back. Dishes might come strewn with staunchly funky bamboo shoots, black yolks of century eggs or raw red weaver-ant larvae, a delicacy in Thailand, where prices for the grubs sometimes outstrip those of pork and beef. When the waitress asks if you want it spicy, don’t try to show off. Know that on a scale of 1 to 10, 5 verges on nuclear.  Playground, 71-30 Roosevelt Avenue (72nd Street), Woodside, Queens; 718-779-7912; no website. The steam table is deep at this restaurant half devoted to Bangladeshi food — whole fish gilded in turmeric; pink hard-boiled eggs nesting in a creamy mix of rice and moong dal; black mashes of kali jira seeds with a soul-shucking streak of mustard oil — and half to American fried chicken. The owner, Mohammed Rahman (known as Khokon), opened the original Neerob in 2009, on the Bronx street called Bangla Bazaar, and the fried-chicken joint two years ago, a few blocks away; after a split with a business partner, he made the two one. The Bangladeshi dishes are unlabeled, but the patient staff will explain. Chicken roast is not roasted but left to seethe quietly in a pan of sweet-hot masala. The crunch of tiny bones is shutki, sun-dried fish, broken down just enough to turn fluffy. Mustard oil is a steady drumbeat. The chiles multiply. The room may be freezing in winter, the lights glaring, but a sign in the corner says, “Enjoy the little things,” and I know it’s right. Neerob at Packsun Halal Chicken, 2160 Westchester Avenue (Castle Hill Avenue), Parkchester, the Bronx; 718-822-8777; no website.

 Here is a blueprint for cooking an entire Thanksgiving meal over the course of one day in an oven and on the four burners above it. Just set your oven to 400 degrees. You’ll need to shop ahead of time, of course, but the rest of the work is sequential and not very difficult.   You can knock it out alone in about eight hours with breaks and lunch included, but an extra set of hands makes the work more enjoyable and the conversation better.
     08:00 a.m. The day begins. Make coffee. Start making lists. Turn your oven to 400. Take a pound of butter out of the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature. (You’ll need it.) 08:10 a.m. Season your turkey and let it sit in the refrigerator. You’ll pull it out around 11 a.m., before cooking it at noon. 
Recipe 
Roast Turkey With Orange and Sage
 
Sam's Tip
Reserve the neck for stock. You might need it later in the day.
 
Make life easier
If you start late, proceed directly to making the next dish, the apple gingersnap crumble. You can spatchcock the bird later and have it done within an hour.
 08:20 a.m. Make the crumble. Taste the filling before adding it to the baking dish. The apples should be sweeter than you’d think, and the cranberries a little more tart. It’ll work out. 
Recipe 
Apple Gingersnap Crumble
 
Melissa's Tip
This is delicious at room temperature, so just leave it out after baking. If you want to, pop it back in the oven when you sit down to eat.
 
Make life easier
Tell someone else to bring dessert.
 09:00 a.m. While the crumble bakes, make the cranberry sauce on the stovetop. It needs a few hours to set up in the refrigerator. 
Recipe 
Red Wine Cranberry Sauce
 
Sam's Tip
If the sauce doesn’t seem to be thickening, cook it a few minutes longer, so that more berries burst, releasing the pectin that causes it to jell.
 
Make life easier
Make the cranberry sauce a few days ahead. It keeps well in the refrigerator.
 Take a break. More coffee. Read the newspaper. Or, more likely, go to the store for the ingredient you forgot. 09:30 a.m. Checkpoint #1 10:00 a.m. Make the dressing and cover it with foil. You can reheat it later, moistened with turkey stock or drippings from the roasting pan. 
Recipe 
Chorizo Dressing With Leeks
 
Sam's Tip
Make sure you buy chorizo that is cured and dried. The fresh version works but is not as flavorful.
 
Make life easier
The better the bread you use, the better the dressing. The thick crust is a nice addition, but you could certainly omit it.
 11:00 a.m. Prepare the sweet potato gratin. (And take the turkey out of the refrigerator to come to room temperature.) 
Recipe 
Sweet Potato and Gruyère Gratin
 
Melissa's Tip
Use a mandoline to slice the sweet potatoes, holding each one in a dish towel to protect your fingertips.
 
Make life easier
Peel and slice the sweet potatoes the day before, and store in a sealable plastic bag in the refrigerator.
 12:00 p.m. The turkey goes in the oven on a rack in a roasting pan. It will cook for about three hours, before resting. Halfway there! Assess your progress. You may have missed breakfast. It’s time to eat lunch. 12:15 p.m. Checkpoint #2 12:30 p.m. One of the great things about cooking with a partner is, there’s time for lunch. In New York City, that means Chinese food. 1:00 p.m. Get the mashed potatoes started and cover them when you’re done. You can reheat them later in the back of the oven, or in a slow cooker or even a microwave. 
Recipe 
Classic Mashed Potatoes
 
Melissa's Tip
If you’re careful not to overprocess the potatoes, which makes them gummy, you can use a stand mixer instead of a hand masher.
 
Make life easier
Don’t peel the potatoes. Some don’t like how that looks, but the taste is marvelous. Say you’re feeling rustic.
 1:30 p.m. Time to start the kale. Don’t stint on the time needed to caramelize the tomato paste. The darker it gets, the smokier the flavor. 
Recipe 
Smoky Braised Kale With Tomato
 
Sam's Tip
Do you have smoked paprika in your pantry already? Throw it out. It’s probably stale. The dish benefits from the punch of fresh spice.
 
Make life easier
Wash, dry and cut the kale the day before, and store wrapped in paper towel and a loose plastic bag until ready to cook.
 2:15 p.m. Time to make salad, if that’s your plan. (It’s Melissa’s plan. Sam rejects salad at Thanksgiving.) 
Recipe 
Fennel-Apple Salad With Walnuts
 
Melissa's Tip
Use a vegetable peeler to shave the Parmesan into wide, paper-thin strips.
 
Make life easier
The salad dressing can be made the day before, as can the toasted walnuts.
 2:40 p.m. Keep your cooking stations clean. Take a few moments to clean the pots and pans that have piled up in the sink. 3:00 p.m. The turkey is ready or nearly so. After you take it out, let it rest on its rack for 30 minutes or so before carving. Almost done! 3:00 p.m. Final Checkpoint 3:15 p.m. Make the gravy in the turkey’s roasting pan, setting it over one or two burners of the stove. You’ll use the drippings as the fat in your roux. 
Recipe 
Classic Pan Gravy
 
Sam's Tip
Use a finely ground “instant” flour to prevent lumps in the gravy, and add to its luxuriousness with some heavy cream at the end.
 
Make life easier
You can make a gravy ahead of time out of chicken stock and roux, and enhance it with turkey drippings on Thanksgiving Day.
 3:40 p.m. Put everything that needs to be reheated back in the oven for 15 minutes, covered, while you get ready to carve and serve. 3:50 p.m. Carve the turkey, dress the salad, get everything out of the oven, put the gravy into a boat or two, and prepare to give thanks. 4:00 p.m. Dinner is served. Made in one day. (We know the fork’s in the wrong place. That’s Thanksgiving for you.)

 The right kitchen tools can shave precious minutes off Thanksgiving dinner preparation. We spoke with Marguerite Preston, an editor at Wirecutter — a New York Times company that tests and reviews products for people who quickly want to know what to buy — and two writers for the site, Lesley Stockton and Michael Sullivan, for their Thanksgiving equipment recommendations and tips. (While all of these items were independently chosen by Wirecutter, The New York Times may earn a commission on purchases through these links.) A large wooden cutting board’s last job on Thanksgiving is as the carving station for the turkey. In the days leading up to the holiday, the board is staging central for chopping vegetables, breads and herbs, and in a pinch, it can be used as a trivet for the hot casseroles rotating out of the oven. This teak board, a larger version of Wirecutter’s overall pick, does not need to be oiled as often as others made of wood: Proteak TeakHaus Rectangle Edge 24-by-18-Inch Board, $115. Tips: Use half a lemon to rub kosher salt directly onto the board to remove odors, and never leave a wooden board in the sink or standing water. The 2016 blade recall does not affect this 14-cup food processor from Cuisinart. “It’s a classic design that hasn’t really been beat in our test,” Mr. Sullivan said. Beyond the tasks you may already use it for — making pie dough, chopping garlic, grating cheese — put the food processor to work as a prep cook the day before Thanksgiving. It can dice mirepoix, slice potatoes and make dips and spreads faster than you: Cuisinart Custom 14-Cup Food Processor, $199. “You will never have enough of these pans in your house,” Ms. Stockton said. Wirecutter’s top choice is made of heavy-gauge aluminum that resists warping at high heat. The pans, available in half and quarter sizes, are perfect for roasting vegetables, baking pies and toasting nuts. Line them with paper towels and they become a drying station for cleaned herbs, or with the addition of a folded kitchen towel, a countertop resting place for tomatoes and easily bruised fruits: Nordic Ware Baker’s Half Sheet, $19.50. Tip: To dry out bread for stuffing, place it on a cooling rack set in a sheet pan and bake. The rack allows better air circulation underneath the bread, and the pan will catch the crumbs. While nothing will beat a chef’s knife for cutting raw meat, a serrated knife is an all-around workhorse for prep work as Thanksgiving approaches. Wirecutter’s upgrade pick, the Tojiro bread knife, has scalloped edges that will not leave a zigzag pattern in sliced meat. It also makes easy work of bread, fruits and root vegetables: Tojiro Bread Slicer, $79.95. Towels tend to toil in the kitchen until the moment they are so stained and frayed that they have to be called rags. Even if few guests will see the ones in your kitchen, consider buying a new set. Wirecutter’s top pick from Williams Sonoma comes in eight colors, and has a waffle weave on one side and terry cloth on the other. “They have the absorbency of terry without looking like a bath towel,” Ms. Stockton said: Williams Sonoma All-Purpose Kitchen Towel, four for $19.95. Tip: Wash the towels several times before their first use in the kitchen for maximum absorbency. This is the one piece of equipment that will ensure everyone walks away from dinner healthy. The ThermoWorks ThermoPop is Wirecutter’s top choice. “It’s reliable, it’s inexpensive and it’s easier to use than the old-school thermometers,” Mr. Sullivan said. Their upgrade choice, also by ThermoWorks, is the $99 Thermapen Mk4: ThermoPop, $29. Tip: Take multiple temperature readings on both sides of the thickest parts of the bird (the thigh and breast), and if the turkey is stuffed, the stuffing, too. Learn more about cooking turkey safely here. If you are expecting a large crowd for Thanksgiving, set the table with Wirecutter’s top choice, a caterer’s set of 12 simple white plates from Pottery Barn. “It comes with a reusable cardboard box with dividers for each plate, so it’s really handy for storing after Thanksgiving is over,” Mr. Sullivan said. If you need fewer than a dozen plates, Wirecutter recommends Ikea’s 365+ plate: Pottery Barn Caterer’s Dinner Plate, set of 12, $59; Ikea 365+ Plate, $2.99. This portable waterproof speaker, the UE Roll 2, will help time fly while you’re prepping for dinner, as it can connect to your phone to broadcast music, podcasts or the radio. “It’s a lot more fun to cook with music,” Mr. Sullivan said. “It makes it a lot less tedious, especially when you’re just prepping one thing after the next.” UE Roll 2, $99.99. Tip: Connect the Bluetooth speaker to a digital assistant, like Alexa, so you can consult recipes or ask cooking questions.  You don’t have to spend a fortune on extra silverware for guests who come over only a few times a year. Wirecutter suggests an inexpensive set by Ikea if you just need a few place settings to get you through the holiday. The Wirecutter flatware review includes eight more recommendations for modern and traditional designs: Ikea Förnuft 20-piece flatware set, $7.99. Tip: Throw all the flatware into the roasting pan to soak after dinner is done. “Napkins and tablecloths are probably the cheapest and easiest way to elevate your dining table,” Ms. Stockton said. Wirecutter’s top picks for both napkin and tablecloth are from Williams Sonoma. Both are 100 percent cotton, and reviewers preferred the heft of the tablecloth and softness of the napkins over the scores of other linens they tested: Williams Sonoma Hotel Dinner Napkins, six for $42; Williams Sonoma Hotel Tablecloth, eight sizes, $49.95 to $79.95. Tips: When calculating the tablecloth size, take into account that after washing, the length will shrink about 5 percent and the width about 3 percent. To remove most stains (red wine, coffee, tea), soak the linens in oxygenated bleach, like Oxi Magic, before laundering. To remove grease, dab the stain with dish soap (or a solvent like Citra Solv if it’s stubborn); do not run the linens through the dryer until the grease spot is removed, as heat will bake a grease stain into the fabric. “Before Thanksgiving Day, it’s something you should think about: Are your knives sharp?” said Ms. Preston, the Wirecutter editor. Dull knives can be dangerous. Wirecutter picked this portable sharpener as testers found it to be the easiest to use for novice cooks: Chef’sChoice 4643 ProntoPro, $49.95. Tips: Don’t leave your knives sitting in the sink, don’t put them in the dishwasher and store them in a drawer only if they have a knife guard on. As with sheet pans, there can never be enough wine openers, which tend to be misplaced as guests get merrier around the Thanksgiving table. “Buy three,” Ms. Stockton said. “Keep one in your back pocket because the other two will disappear.” True Fabrications Truetap Double Hinged Waiter’s Corkscrew, $5.99.

 Futurists envision a kitchen in which appliances talk to each other, the refrigerator knows to order milk when you run out, a virtual assistant tells the oven exactly how to cook a piece of fish and recipe ideas pop up on your watch depending on your specific nutritional needs that day and what you have on hand to cook. And in this kitchen of the future, just speaking into one device will do it all.Like self-driving cars, kitchen automation is in its awkward adolescent phase. Bluetooth technology is prevalent in a plenty of appliances. Ovens have visual recognition capabilities, and you can track how your herbs are growing on your phone. But much of the technology out there currently creates solutions for which there are no problems.“Is there really a consumer demand for this product?” asked Evan Dash, the owner of the appliance development company StoreBound, as he advised hopeful engineers and designers at the the Smart Kitchen Summit held Oct. 10 and 11 in Seattle. “Be honest with yourself.” Here are some hits and misses on display there. The oven, already widely available at cookware stores and online, was like the popular kid at school at the conference. It has a camera that recognizes food, asking, for example, if you are cooking sausage or asparagus. Then it cooks it perfectly based on its database of recipes, your preferences and a thermometer. You can even start your steak while on your way home from work and watch it cook via an app. The e-Cooker uses pulsed electronic fields, which are short high-voltage bursts, to cook food with the low heat and precision of a sous-vide machine and the speed of a microwave. It has been widely used in medical treatment, and is trying to make the leap to the kitchen. Meet the Keurig of kitchen gardens. Insert a seed pod, add water and the machine will monitor each little plant that grows, giving it the right amount of light and water. Plants are supposed to grow faster than in your garden, and you can track it all on an app. One of the best-looking products on display, the Stagg EKG+ from Fellow allows coffee obsessives to remotely heat water to an exact temperature for pour-overs. Bluetooth technology and an app let  you track recipes, and remember that for your last drink, you gave that 20 grams of Ethiopian Limu two minutes at 201 degrees, and it was awesome.  The HOPii is the latest advancement in personal beer brewing. The device uses various combinations of wort, hops, yeast and flavorings pulled from the flavor profiles of actual breweries. Pop them in the machine and, seven days later, pull fresh craft beer from its tap. Some ideas were clearly in the prototype phase; GammaChef was one. Bar-coded plastic containers filled with precut food are stored in this refrigerated machine. At a set time, GammaChef will heat a pan and add ingredients in the proper order based on a database of recipes. A robotic arm stirs the meal, mixing in spices. The scramble is on to figure out how to manage food inventory in the refrigerator, but PantryChic has the dry goods covered. An app guides you through a PantryChic recipe, advising which programmable container to put over the smart scale. Then it measures out the exact amount of flour or sugar. The app tracks how much of any given dry ingredient is left, in case you’re at the store and have forgotten if you have enough rice for dinner. Several cooks at the show who had tried the Hestan Cue marveled at technology built into both the pan and its burner. Videos featuring a professional chef guide cooks through a collection of 150 sophisticated recipes that can be adjusted in real time based on information taken from sensors inside the equipment. The app tells the cook when the pan is at the perfect temperature to sear salmon, for example, then adjusts the temperature when the fish starts to cook.

Aaron Sorkin annotates the script he wrote for his directorial debut, “Molly’s Game.” Watch the scene, then read Mr. Sorkin’s commentary below.
  The film and television writer Aaron Sorkin (“The Social Network,” “The West Wing”) has directed his first film, “Molly’s Game” (Dec. 25), his adaptation of the memoir by Molly Bloom, who was convicted for her role in a high-stakes gambling ring. The film stars Jessica Chastain as a professional skier who becomes the organizer of a clandestine poker game. As the client list for that game grows, it gets the attention of the Russian mafia  and, ultimately, the F.B.I. In the excerpt below, Molly is in court awaiting arraignment with Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), the lawyer she has approached about taking her case. Mr. Sorkin has annotated descriptions and dialogue, discussing some of the decisions behind his choices.   INTERIOR COURTROOM The courtroom is huge, cavernous, and ornate, and right now it’s a bit of a spectacle.   On the right side of the gallery are the defendants and their lawyers — about 60 people in all. Behind a plexiglass partition are some more defendants in prison coveralls and shackles. The defendants range in age from early 20s to late 80s. On the left side of the gallery are the wives and girlfriends of the defendants. They’re all beautifully dressed and manicured and have on some of their gaudiest jewelry for the occasion.  Seated in back of them are the press and it was a tough ticket to get. At the prosecutor’s table are three assistant U.S. attorneys, including HARRISON WELLSTONE, the lead attorney on the case who we’ll get to know later. JUDGE DUSTIN FOXMAN is already seated at the bench and is quietly going over some business with the prosecutors as the packed courtroom hums with quiet chatter, some of it in Russian. CHARLIE points a bodyguard to where he wants Molly to sit — four taped-off seats on the right side toward the back. As MOLLY and the BODYGUARDS take their seats, CHARLIE stands in the aisle a moment and looks at HARRISON, the lead prosecutor. HARRISON turns back from the bench and heads to his table and sees Charlie. HARRISON half-smiles and gives CHARLIE a small wave. CHARLIE gives him a small wave back and takes his seat on the aisle next to one of the bodyguards. There’s no love lost between Charlie and Harrison. MOLLY’s clocked all that. CHARLIE (quietly to MOLLY) You got a good judge, he’s a good guy.  MOLLY  How ’bout the prosecutor? CHARLIE takes a moment and then shakes his head “No.” JUDGE FOXMAN raps his gavel once, the room quiets down, and everyone takes their seats. JUDGE FOXMAN Counsel, please state your appearances for the record? HARRISON Good morning, Your Honor, Harrison Wellstone and George Brennan on behalf of the government, joined at counsel table by F.B.I. Agent Deborah D’Angelo. JUDGE FOXMAN Are there any oral motions at this time? One of the defense lawyers stands up — MR. SERNOVITZ Your Honor — The seemingly routine business of the hearing continues under the following — CHARLIE (quietly to the bodyguard): Switch with me a second.   CHARLIE and the BODYGUARD switch places so that Charlie’s sitting next to Molly now. CHARLIE (CONT’D) (quietly): Do you know what a “Vor v Zakone” is? A “Vor”? MOLLY No. CHARLIE The literal translation is “thief-in-law.” It’s the Russian equivalent of a don or a godfather. Nikolai Illyanovich is a Vor. He’s the one who tried to fix the Salt Lake City Olympics. MOLLY I wasn’t there. CHARLIE He’s also had a lot of people killed. MOLLY I’ve never had an audience with the Vor, I’m not a made man and I don’t know who Nikolai Illyanovich is.  CHARLIE (pointing to a man behind the plexiglass): He’s standing right there. I can introduce you, you’re co-defendants. (to the BODYGUARD) Switch back. CHARLIE and the BODYGUARD switch back to their original seats. The business of the court continues. CLERK Defendant 4, Jonathan Hirsch. SAGEN Good morning, Your Honor. David Sagen for the purposes of today’s appearance. JUDGE FOXMAN Has the defendant seen a copy of the indictment? HIRSCH Yes, Your Honor. JUDGE FOXMAN Have you discussed it with your Lawyer? HIRSCH I have. JUDGE FOXMAN Do you waive its public reading? HIRSCH Yes. JUDGE FOXMAN: How do you plead at this time? HIRSCH Not guilty. JUDGE FOXMAN: Thank you, you may be seated. CLERK Defendant 5, Arthur Azen. The court’s business continues as — CHARLIE (whispering to the BODYGUARD) Switch with me. CHARLIE and the BODYGUARD switch seats again and CHARLIE speaks quietly to MOLLY — CHARLIE (CONT’D) Just in case your lawyer doesn’t mention it, the next time you appear in front of the judge you should rethink your clothes. You look like the Cinemax version of yourself.  MOLLY I sold my clothes after the government seized all my money two years ago which incidentally was the last time I ran a poker game but I think I already mentioned that. CHARLIE (beat) O.K.  (pause — then quietly) Your old boss — the one you call Dean in the book — he was terrible to you. Why would you cover for him by changing it to “poor people bagels”? MOLLY (quietly) I promise it couldn’t matter less. CHARLIE (shrugs) Just making conversation.  CHARLIE’s not really satisfied but he taps the bodyguard and they switch back. JUDGE FOXMAN Do you waive its public reading? ALEXANDER I do. JUDGE FOXMAN How do you plead at this time? ALEXANDER Not guilty. CLERK Defendant 7, Molly Bloom. MOLLY and CHARLIE stand and when they do, everyone in the courtroom turns around to get a look at the Poker Princess. The press starts writing notes on pads. CHARLIE Good morning, Your Honor. Charles Jaffey, just for the purposes — And CHARLIE stops mid-sentence and thinks... JUDGE FOXMAN (pause) It’s good to see you, Mr. Jaffey, are you with us this morning? (beat) Mr. Jaffey? CHARLIE Just a moment please, sir. (to the BODYGUARD) Switch back. They switch — MOLLY Seriously? CHARLIE You said you left ten times that much on the street. Back at my office. I said it’s a $250,000 retainer and you said you left ten times that on the street. MOLLY Yeah. JUDGE FOXMAN Counsel, I need to record your appearance.  CHARLIE Please the court Your Honor, just one moment. (to Molly) You were extending credit. You’re destitute and you left two and a half million dollars on the street? MOLLY I had to. CHARLIE Didn’t anyone try to buy your debt sheet? MOLLY Everyone tried to buy my debt sheet, is this the right time to — CHARLIE Why didn’t you sell it like you sold your clothes? MOLLY I couldn’t. CHARLIE Why? MOLLY I couldn’t be sure how they were gonna collect. CHARLIE (pause) Yeah I was afraid you were gonna say that. JUDGE FOXMAN Counsel? CHARLIE thinks… CHARLIE (pause) Charles Jaffey for the defendant, Your Honor. JUDGE FOXMAN For the purposes of this hearing only? CHARLIE No sir, I’m Molly Bloom’s attorney. She’s read the indictment, discussed it with her lawyer, waives her right to have it read to her and pleads “Not Guilty.”  HARRISON clocks this, smiles and shakes his head. CLERK Defendant 8, Alexander Gollib. MOLLY’s looking at CHARLIE, surprised... CHARLIE I’ll need to keep reading your book. Produced by Alicia DeSantis Advertisement",7229

 Nine films are nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday. In what parts of the country was each contender the most popular? We wanted to find out for a few reasons. There has been an increasing disconnect between films that are hits and films that Hollywood honors. The last three best picture winners (“Spotlight,” “Birdman,” “12 Years a Slave”) went unseen by most Americans, at least during their theatrical runs. With the country so politically divided, we also wanted to know whether audience support for nominees fell along similar urban-rural or coastal-heartland fissures. Studios don’t disclose ticket sales by region, so we did the next best thing, looking at how many active Facebook users in a given county “liked” each of the nominees. Studios increasingly use Facebook as a home base for films, with photos, videos and news regularly fed to fans. We found that the best picture contenders had surprisingly stratified fan bases. Compare “Moonlight” and “Fences,” for instance. The poetic “Moonlight,” about a black man from a poor Miami neighborhood coming to terms with his homosexuality, had a fairly thin following in the South; its heaviest support came from New York and San Francisco. The more commercially minded “Fences,” featuring a predominantly black cast but without a gay theme, drew much of its power from Mississippi and the Carolinas. Over all, it was interesting to see how much a film’s setting affected its fan base and what kinds of themes resonated in the center of the country. Take a look: This movie, about the overlooked contributions of black women in the NASA space race of the 1960s, has done better at the domestic box office than any of its best picture rivals. But the fan base for “Hidden Figures,” starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, was relatively concentrated in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas. A musical about young dreamers in Hollywood, “La La Land” was especially popular in Southern California — shocker — and in conservative, largely white states like Utah, Idaho and Wisconsin. Starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, “La La Land” is considered the strong favorite to win best picture. But the escapist musical has also been criticized for its liberal, white worldview, in particular when it comes to the subject of jazz. A science-fiction thriller about a linguist (Amy Adams) recruited to decipher alien communication, “Arrival” drew most of its support from the Northwest — the film’s primary setting — and from liberal strongholds in the East, including college towns in Vermont and Maine. (Fun fact: Maine also has a lot of U.F.O. sightings.) Just as striking was a lack of fandom in conservative Southern states with large nonwhite populations. Directed by Mel Gibson, “Hacksaw Ridge” tells the true story of Desmond T. Doss, an intensely religious man who insisted on going into combat during World War II without a weapon — and saved dozens of wounded men in Okinawa alone. The patriotic film’s deepest support was in Appalachia, with other rural areas (Montana, North Dakota) also strong. The polar opposite of “Arrival.” Starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis and set in Pittsburgh in the 1950s, “Fences” had many fewer fans in the Pacific Northwest than in the South, home to nine of the top 10 counties where support was strongest. The remaining top county was Allegheny in Pennsylvania — that is, Pittsburgh and its suburbs. The counties with the largest concentration of fans could all be found in Massachusetts or New Hampshire. Directed and written by Kenneth Lonergan, “Manchester by the Sea” tells the story of a handyman (Casey Affleck) tormented by guilt and grief. Like other nominees with primarily white casts, “Manchester by the Sea” had a small fan base in Southern cities. Over all, this film had the fewest Facebook followers of all of the nominees. Set largely in India and focused on an adoption, “Lion” landed particularly well in affluent counties on the coasts — Marin in California, Bergen in New Jersey and Westchester in New York were among the top 10 in fan support. The reason may involve its highbrow form: Starring Dev Patel, the arty film is heavily subtitled and hops around in time. No surprise here: Facebook users in Texas and New Mexico loved “Hell or High Water,” the story of two outlaws (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who rob small-town Texas banks while trying to outwit a pair of colorful lawmen (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham).  Conversely, this film had the fewest fans of any of the nine nominees in the Northeast. The definition of a big-city movie: New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle. The nation’s heartland was not as enthusiastic, and the film’s subject matter appears to have polarized black audiences, holding it back at the box office. “Moonlight” is the year’s least-watched nominee, although it also cost the least to make — about $1.5 million.

That’s a question that his elder daughter and White House senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, believes she should not be asked. “I think it’s a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter if she believes the accusers of her father when he’s affirmatively stated that there’s no truth to it,” Ms. Trump told the NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander in an interview that aired on NBC’s “Today” on Monday. Ms. Trump had been in South Korea since Friday, leading the United States delegation at the Winter Olympics. In a wide-ranging interview there on Sunday, Mr. Alexander asked her, “Do you believe your father’s accusers?” “I don’t think that’s a question you would ask many other daughters,” she said. “I believe my father. I know my father. So, I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father.” Ms. Trump’s suggestion that she be spared the question faced pushback online from journalists and others, who noted that she not only led the American delegation for the closing ceremony of the Olympics, but has also positioned herself as a voice for women’s issues inside the White House. Some conservatives, in the meantime, suggested that her dismissal of the question was akin to one offered by Chelsea Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, when asked whether her father’s sex scandal had affected her mother’s credibility. In the NBC interview, Ms. Trump also said that she had not yet been interviewed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, but that she believed Mr. Mueller could be trusted. She also repeated the White House’s denials that her father’s presidential campaign had colluded with Moscow. “Consistently we have said there was no collusion,” she said. “There was no collusion. And we believe that Mueller will do his work and reach that same conclusion.” Ms. Trump also appeared to diverge slightly from her father, who, in response to the fatal shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., this month, had suggested that arming some teachers could improve school safety. “To be honest, I don’t know,” she said. “I think that having a teacher who is armed, who cares deeply about her students, or his students, and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it’s an idea that needs to be discussed.”",2428

Walters, made the comment on Friday night at a dinner in Oxon Hill, Md., that was part of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. “We elected Mike Steele to be the R.N.C. chair because he’s a black guy,” said Mr. Walters, the communications director for the American Conservative Union, which organized the conference. “That was the wrong thing to do.” There were audible gasps when Mr. Walters made the comment, Jonathan Levine, the media editor at The Wrap, who was at the dinner, said on Twitter. Mr. Steele was the first black chairman of the Republican National Committee, serving from 2009 to 2011. His tenure coincided with the election of Barack Obama as the first black president. Mr. Walters said Republicans were “somewhat lost” after the election of Mr. Obama and “weren’t sure what to do,” leading to Mr. Steele’s selection as chairman. Speaking with Joy-Ann Reid of MSNBC on Friday night, Mr. Steele, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland and the first black person elected to statewide office there, said he did not accept an apology from Mr. Walters. “He said at one point, ‘I apologize,’ Mr. Steele said, adding that he told Mr. Walters, “That’s not enough.” Mr. Walters apologized on Twitter on Friday night. “I spoke with Mike Steele and apologized because the words I used do not capture my heart,” he wrote. He added: “Sometimes when you speak, the words that come out do not reflect what’s intended. Many of us were critics of how Chairman Steele performed at the R.N.C. He is a good man, and he did his best.” In a phone interview on Saturday morning on Ms. Reid’s show, Mr. Steele was asked if the Republican Party had a problem with racism. “Yes, they do. And I think we need to be honest and acknowledge it,” Mr. Steele said. “The fact that people sit here now and say this has nothing to do with race — yeah, it does, when you stand on a podium and blatantly speak to race the way Ian did.” Mr. Walters did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement, “We reject the offensive comments made” on Friday night. Black people made up 2 percent of registered Republican voters in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center, the same percentage as in 1992. President Trump received 8 percent of the black vote in 2016. Mr. Steele, speaking Saturday on his show on SiriusXM radio with Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said comments like Mr. Miller’s “undermine” efforts to “expand this party and its reach into communities of color across the country.” Mr. Schlapp apologized to Mr. Steele and said Mr. Walters’s comments were “unfortunate words” that might have been based on Mr. Steele’s criticism of the “Trump phenomena.” Mr. Steele has been critical of Mr. Trump’s racially tinged comments about Haiti and some African nations. Mr. Steele also said that Mr. Trump’s suggestion that armed teachers would help prevent school shootings was “desperate and delusional.” On Saturday, Mr. Schlapp urged Mr. Steele “to have some grace,” which angered the host. “Wait a minute,” Mr. Steele said. “What the hell do I have to be graceful for?” He added: “It is stupid to sit there and say we elected a black man chairman of the party and that was a mistake. Do you know how that sounds to the black community? Do you know how that sounds to Americans?”",3668

On Friday, he lifted the veil. So to speak. Appearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., the president poked fun at his own mop, a tangle of twists and turns that coalesce in what, in the end, becomes an apparent full head of hair. But if you look within, the president said, not all is as it seems. As Mr. Trump was speaking, a television monitor, showing him on the stage, caught his eye. “What a nice picture that is,” he said. “Look at that. I’d love to watch that guy speak.” The crowd roared. Then, as many people would do when they suddenly realize they’re being looked at, he considered how his hair looked. He hovered his hands over his multi-angled locks, turned his back to the crowd to show off his solid-gold covering like a tarp keeping the rain out, then briefly touched the edges over his neck. Facing the crowd again, he opened up. “Oh, I try like hell to hide that bald spot, folks. I work hard at it,” he said. “It doesn’t look bad. Hey, we are hanging in, we are hanging in, we are hanging in there. Right? Together, we are hanging in.” It’s not always easy to hide bald spots, especially when you’re a president, considering one of your duties is to climb the windy stairs to Air Force One with cameras watching every step. One such video created a stir on the internet in early February, leaving no doubt that there was some heavy combing going on. It’s no secret that Mr. Trump’s hair isn’t what it once was. His longtime doctor, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, said in early February that the president takes Propecia, a prostate-related drug that promotes hair growth. The one-a-day pill is a common treatment for male-pattern hair loss, and is better at halting hair loss than regrowing what’s already been lost. Mr. Trump’s hair frequently came up as a discussion point during the presidential campaign, but he strongly denied rumors that he would wear a wig or other fake dos. “Maybe they don’t like my hair — which is real, by the way. Look at that,” he said at a campaign event in June 2015, running his hands through his locks. He then motioned a woman onto the stage, asking her: “Is that sucker real?” She touched his hairline and said: “It’s thin, but it’s real.” In August 2015, he invited a woman in the crowd at one of his events to yank on his hair. “I don’t wear a toupee — it’s my hair,” he said. And the late-night television host Jimmy Fallon famously ran his hands through the candidate’s hair in September 2016, an act Mr. Fallon has come to see as a setback. But nothing fell out (or off).",2736

He cited his experience as the chief executive of the organizing committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and compared Utah, where his mother was born, favorably to the nation’s capital. “Utah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington,” he said, contrasting the state’s balanced budgets and positive export-to-import-ratio to Washington’s. And, in a pointed gesture toward the restrictive immigration policies of President Trump, he noted that “Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world,” while “Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.” Last month, The New York Times reported that Mr. Romney had said privately that he was planning a Senate campaign. “I’m running,” he texted a close friend, Kem Gardner. He would replace Senator Orrin G. Hatch, who announced in early January that he would retire at the end of the year. Mr. Romney is popular in Utah, despite not having been born in the state and having spent much of his life elsewhere. (He and his wife, Ann, once kept a vacation home in Park City and in 2013, built a mansion in Holladay, a suburb of Salt Lake City.) He is one of the most prominent Mormons in American public life, a political advantage in a state where the population is about 60 percent Mormon and many civic and business leaders attend the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney’s running mate in 2012, endorsed him in a statement on Friday, saying, “Our party and our country are always better off when Mitt is engaged.” Mr. Trump had pleaded with Senator Hatch, the longest-serving Senate Republican, to run for an eighth term, and Mr. Romney’s video underscored the potential for continuing clashes between himself and the president. The clip took several barely veiled shots at Mr. Trump’s policies and manner, as well as the ever-coarsening state of political discourse on Washington’s Capitol Hill. “On Utah’s Capitol Hill,” he said, “people treat one another with respect.” During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Romney decried Mr. Trump as a “fraud” and a “phony,” and said that he was “playing the American public for suckers.” But after the election, he embarked on a more cordial relationship with the president, as his name was one of several in the discussion of possible nominees for Secretary of State. After the violent events in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, he again changed his approach, imploring the president to apologize for saying that there had been blame on both sides. “What he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn,” he said in a Facebook post in August. The two have talked more recently, but Mr. Trump has not offered his support for Mr. Romney’s campaign. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement. Mr. Romney is well-known to many Americans, having run for president twice, once in 2008 and again in 2012, when he faced Barack Obama as the Republican Party’s nominee. After losing, he remained relatively visible, first with the debut of the 2014 documentary “Mitt,” an intimate look at his campaigns that made Mr. Romney seem less awkward and ill-at-ease than he often had while campaigning, and then with his comments about Mr. Trump in 2016.",3679

By Linda Qiu Democrats offered five separate responses to President Trump’s State of the Union address, differing in content and tone but united in their disapproval of Mr. Trump. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts gave the official Democratic rebuttal on Tuesday night, in which he portrayed Mr. Trump as a divisive figure. Elizabeth Guzman, a delegate in Virginia’s State Assembly, delivered another Democratic Party response in Spanish.  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont followed with his own response. Donna Edwards, a former congresswoman from Maryland, spoke on behalf of the Working Families Party, a minor party with several state-based chapters. And Representative Maxine Waters of California spoke on Black Entertainment Television on Wednesday night. The New York Times fact-checked Mr. Trump’s address in real time. Now, here’s an assessment of the various Democrats’ responses.  Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy is likely referring to a 2014 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. It found that compensation for chief executives at the top 350 American firms was about 300 times more than their employees.  To start, that figure is out of date. The institute’s most recent study on the matter, released in 2017, found a smaller — but still high — ratio of 271 to 1.  Also, the employment compensation research site PayScale conducted a 2016 survey across 168 companies with revenues over $1 billion. That research found executive cash compensation was, on average, about 70 times the median salary of their employees, though some broached the 300 to 1 mark.  Looking at wages alone — and not counting other forms of compensation like bonuses or stock options — chief executives made an average salary of $194,000 in 2016, about four times what the average worker made, according to even broader data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  It’s also worth noting that the pay gap between top executives and their employees is generally understood to be significantly wider today than ratios in the 1960s and 1970s. Ms. Guzman Mr. Trump repeatedly has said he supported health care protections for pre-existing conditions, though he also has backed efforts to undermine them.  In the legislative debate over reforming health care, five major Republican proposals sought last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Two would have retained the health care law’s prohibitions on insurers that seek to impose higher costs on patients with pre-existing medical conditions. The three others, including one drafted by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, would allow states to decide whether to enforce the prohibitions. All five proposals have either been rejected or are stalled in Congress.  In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump said in September that he “would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions,” but erroneously added, “it does!” No major health care proposals have included an explicit tax because of advancing age. What Ms. Guzman is likely referring to are price limits for insurers. Two of the Republican proposals sought to retain the health care law’s restrictions on charging older Americans more. The other three wanted to let states to waive the requirement. It is inaccurate to call the easing of restrictions “a tax,” as it would be insurers — and not the government — that imposes and collects charges.  The change in “age rating” would not apply to Americans 65 and older who are covered by Medicare, nor those between 50 to 64 who have employer-sponsor insurance.  Mr. Sanders Mr. Sanders is referring to one of the Republican bills that sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act. (The bill failed by a vote of 51 to 49.) According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would have insured 32 million fewer people in 2026 than those who were covered under the health care law.  It’s worth noting, however, that not every person among the 32 million would have been “thrown” off health care systems. Though many would have lost coverage through the repeal of Medicaid expansion, others would have simply chosen to forgo purchasing insurance in that market.  Ms. Edwards Ms. Edwards is right that most of the benefits of the tax law signed by Mr. Trump in December will accrue to the wealthy and very wealthy. But middle class and low-income Americans will get a tax cut too.  The Tax Policy Center, a research group, found that taxes will be reduced for every income group this year. And the 40th to 60th percentile of American households by income will receive an average tax cut of about $900 through 2025. Personal tax cuts expire after that point, though Congress may choose to extend them.  But the highest income brackets do stand to benefit the most. In 2018, the top 1 percent of earners will receive about 20.5 percent of the benefits, increasing to 25.3 percent in 2025 and 83 percent in 2027. Ms. Waters The United States had never formally ratified the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 other nations before Mr. Trump abandoned the trade deal. But his administration has been renegotiating the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement for six months and the trade agreement with South Korea since January.  And Mr. Trump has not yet proposed withdrawing from any of the other ongoing trade deals the United States has with 19 other countries.  Natalia Gutierrez Avila contributed from Mexico City.

Now, less than two weeks after those hopes were raised, an interview has appeared to dash those hopes — or at least muddy the waters. In an interview for the March issue of InStyle, the beauty and fashion magazine, the former talk show host was asked how she felt about the prospect of what would have been a historic campaign to put a black woman in the White House. The interview was conducted three weeks before her speech at the Golden Globes, InStyle confirmed Thursday. “I’ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not,” she said. “And so it’s not something that interests me. I don’t have the DNA for it.” But that doesn’t mean she wasn’t toying with the idea. “I met with someone the other day who said that they would help me with a campaign,” she told the magazine. “That’s not for me.” Ms. Winfrey, a television icon, film producer and actress, sparked questions about a potential run when she delivered a stirring acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes on Jan. 7. The speech touched on racism and sexism in America and concluded on a hopeful note. “I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon,” she said. “And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, ‘Me too’ again.” Almost instantly, her fans began wondering, only some of them in jest, if the speech was a prelude to something bigger. Stedman Graham, her longtime partner, did nothing to dissuade them when, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, he said she would “absolutely do it,” though he prefaced it by saying that the decision was “up to the people.” In her, some Democrats saw a candidate who could turn out crucial voters — women and African-Americans — while driving few others away. Ms. Winfrey herself had expressed a desire to associates in recent months to play a role in uniting the country, two people briefed on her thinking told The Times. And while she may not ultimately do so by running for president, Ms. Winfrey may be able to pursue that goal through other means. “I have to say the core of me is about conversations. Exploring the depth of our human experiences. That is what I do. That is my calling,” she told the magazine. “Whether I do that through dramas, producing stories with OWN [Oprah Winfrey Network], or one-on-one conversations that matter, I know that’s what I’m here to do.”",2808

Trump amassed a long list of promises. Some became rallying cries and signature to his candidacy (“build the wall”). Others reflected conventional Republican policy wishes (repealing the Affordable Care Act). And then there were the unorthodox pledges about how he would comport himself in office, a few probably improvised (“I will never be in a bicycle race”) or doomed from the start (“We won’t tweet anymore — not presidential”). Mr. Trump has described his first year in office as “a year of real change.” Here’s an assessment on his progress on promises about his approach to the presidency. Of the six measures Mr. Trump outlined in his 100-day action plan “to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington,” he has kept his word on two, imposing lifetime bans on White House officials lobbying for foreign governments and requiring the elimination of two regulations for every one enacted. He has also partially fulfilled two pledges. His promised hiring freeze on federal employees was enacted in January 2017, but lifted in April. Additionally, he took a narrowly tailored approach to his pledge to bar White House and congressional officials from lobbying for five years after leaving office. Rather than a blanket restriction, his executive order specified that White House officials could not lobby the agencies they served, and did not cover congressional officials. But he has not taken any action on two other promises. Mr. Trump has yet to propose term limits for members of Congress or enact a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Mr. Trump, a billionaire, vowed to not take “even one dollar” of his $400,000 annual salary as president, following in the footsteps of presidents like John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover. So far, he has kept his word, donating his paychecks to the National Park Service in the first quarter of 2017, the Education Department in the second, and then the Health and Human Services Department in the third to help combat the opioid crisis. The White House would not answer questions about what Mr. Trump would do with his paychecks in the fourth quarter of last year. As the first presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his tax returns, Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed to do so once his Internal Revenue Service audit was complete. The pledge was flawed to begin with. Though tax lawyers may advise against it, the I.R.S. has said that an audit does not prevent individuals from releasing their own tax information. The Trump campaign also released a letter from his lawyers that said Mr. Trump’s tax returns, before 2009, were “closed administratively” — or no longer subject to an audit. But in May, Mr. Trump reneged on the promise in an interview with The Economist, moving the release date to “after I’m out of office.” After incessantly chastising President Barack Obama for golfing, Mr. Trump promised during the campaign that “because I’m going to be working for you, I’m not going to have time to go play golf.” He later made an exception for “leaders of countries and people who can help us.” Yet Mr. Trump has played more golf than his predecessor, according to independent trackers. The White House has repeatedly declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s golf partners. While he played a round with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in February, he was also accompanied by professional golf players, not world leaders, for at least four games. Mr. Trump pledged to “not be a president who took vacations” and blasted Mr. Obama for his own personal trips. In a 2012 report, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the president is “always on duty” and that his vacations are considered official travel. Over the past year, Mr. Trump has taken some R&R. He spent 17 days in at his golf club in New Jersey, which the White House labeled a “working vacation,” and voyaged to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a holiday respite that included presidential duties. It is unclear how those trips were different from the vacations that Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama for taking. The former president, for example, spent holidays in Hawaii — a frequent talking point of Mr. Trump’s — where he played golf, received intelligence briefings and visited troops. Over all, Mr. Trump has visited a Trump property one out of every three days since taking office.",4445

Mr. Higbie was quick to resign, he said on Twitter, “so as not to distract” from Mr. Trump’s successes. “One of my biggest regrets is any shame I may have brought to the administration,” Mr. Higbie said on Saturday. “I’m sorry. I’m getting a little choked up here.” Most of Mr. Higbie’s offensive comments, which were unearthed by CNN, were made in 2013 and 2014. While hosting an internet radio broadcast, “Sound of Freedom,” in 2013, Mr. Higbie spoke of the “high percentage of people on welfare in the black race,” blaming “a lax of morality.” He added that taxpayers “are tired of supporting government checks going to these people who think that breeding is a form of employment,” CNN reported. Mr. Higbie, 34, who is from Greenwich, Conn., said that at the time, he was trying to make a name for himself as a controversial radio host who taunted liberal guests and garnered ratings through “shock and awe.” “I picked and prodded at every single guest I had in order to try to get a rise out of them,” he said on Saturday. “And it was just poor class.” In one “Sound of Freedom” broadcast, Mr. Higbie said he opposed homosexuality in part because he was “molested by a gay guy” when he was a child, CNN reported. “So I, I just, I really don’t care for them,” he said in 2013. “You know what, you want to be gay? Fine. Do it over in your own corner.” Mr. Higbie, a former Navy SEAL who served two tours in Iraq, also said that those getting government assistance “at any given time during any election cycle” should “not get to vote at the subsequent election.” He said that 75 percent of people with post-traumatic stress disorder don’t have it, and “they’re either milking something for a little extra money in disability or they’re just, they honestly are just lying.” Mr. Higbie also expressed disdain for Muslims several times. “People say, ‘You know, you’re so harsh,’” he said on Warrior Talk Radio in August 2014. “I was called an Islamophobe and I was like: ‘No, no, no, no, no, I’m not afraid of them. I don’t like them. Big difference.’ And they were like, ‘Well, you’re racist.’ I was like, ‘Fine, if that’s the definition of it, then I guess I am.’” In 2013, Mr. Higbie was fresh out of the Navy, and transitioning back to civilian life, he said on Saturday. “When I came out of the military, I struggled with how to accept Islam because of my experience overseas, as do a lot of veterans,” he said. “Those comments were directed at the faction that was either radicalized or tolerant of the radicalized ones.” As for his views about homosexuality, Mr. Higbie said that he had recently developed some “very close friends” who are gay, and had learned that “it’s a live-and-let-live thing.” “I met these people and I was like, ‘Wow, they’re normal people,’” he said. “It was a good experience for me to understand that you can’t just hate people because of that. Not that I hate them. I just didn’t understand the ideology. And I was wrong to have that opinion.” Mr. Higbie also drew criticism in 2016, while serving as a spokesman for the pro-Trump group Great America PAC, when he said during an interview with Megyn Kelly on Fox News that there was “precedent” for creating a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries, a proposal met with strong opposition by civil rights activists. “We’ve done it based on race, we’ve done it based on religion, we’ve done it based on region,” Mr. Higbie told Ms. Kelly. “We’ve done it with Iran back — back a while ago. We did it during World War II with Japanese.” He later explained to The New York Times that he had been alluding to the United States Supreme Court, which had “upheld things as horrific as Japanese internment camps.” Mr. Higbie is one of many White House officials who have resigned or were fired, dismissed or reassigned over the past year, including Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist; Omarosa Manigault Newman, director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison; and Tom Price, the health and human services secretary. The White House on Saturday confirmed that it had accepted Mr. Higbie’s resignation but offered no additional comment.",4812
5a62765095d0e0110c1a58d3,2018-01-19T22:50:52+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/us/politics/trump-government-shutdown-military.html,Politics,"WASHINGTON — As the Senate raced on Friday to keep the government open, President Trump and other top Republicans are repeatedly — and misleadingly — warning that a shutdown would incapacitate the military. “But if for any reason it shuts down, the worst thing is what happens to our military,” he said later Thursday at the Pentagon. Republican leaders have begun echoing that warning. The speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, in an interview on Friday on Fox News, accused Democrats of “legislative hostage-taking. And the collateral damage in this are the men and women in the military.” In fact, contingency plans from the Pentagon as well as past experience show that many parts of the military would continue to operate even if the government is temporarily closed. “The threats never end, and so this department will never shut down,” Dana W. White, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in December. On Thursday, the House passed legislation to keep the government funded through Feb. 16, but Republicans were struggling on Friday to muster enough votes in the Senate to approve a similar bill before midnight on Friday. That is the deadline to approve a new spending plan — without which certain federal employees would be placed on unpaid furlough. But the Pentagon “will, of course, continue to prosecute the war in Afghanistan and ongoing operations against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, including preparation of forces for deployment into those conflicts,” the deputy secretary of defense, Patrick M. Shanahan, wrote in a memo on Thursday. “The department must, as well, continue many other operations necessary for the safety of human life or the protection of property,” he wrote. The memo said that combat missions, training exercises, reconnaissance activities, intelligence gathering, and surveillance and telecommunications centers that are “necessary for national security” would all carry on. Counterterrorism operations and emergency responses to oil spills or fires would also not be affected, the memo said. Military hospitals and medical facilities would remain open, and health care coverage for department employees would not lapse. All active-duty military, including reserve forces, and civilian workers “necessary to carry out or support excepted activities” would continue to work, but would be paid once the government reopens. (Military contractors who provide services under a fully-funded contract that was awarded before the Friday deadline would also remain on the job.) On Friday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis estimated that the shutdown would furlough roughly 50 percent of his civilian work force. That’s 371,000 employees, or about 13 percent, out of a total work force of nearly three million. (There are 1.3 million active-duty troops and 826,000 National Guard and Reserve forces.) But Mr. Mattis warned that maintenance activities and intelligence gathering — operations not likely deemed necessary to national security and exempted by his deputy’s memo — would grind to a halt because of the shutdown. At its peak, the last shutdown in 2013 resulted in the furlough of about 850,000 employees a day, or 40 percent of the federal civilian work force in the executive branch, according to the Office of Management and Budget. That year, the Pentagon also did not furlough more than 1.3 million active military personnel, nor half of its civilian work force. They were paid through the shutdown, even as other federal workers were furloughed. Legislation to do the same this year has been introduced in the House. And as commander in chief, Mr. Trump could also theoretically exempt anyone and activity he wishes to avert the “devastating” effect he claims a shutdown will have.",3731
5a5802ae95d0e0110c1a4222,2018-01-12T00:34:50+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/chain-migration-immigration-daca-factcheck.html,Politics,"WASHINGTON — “Chain migration,” or family-based immigration, has emerged as a key point of negotiations — and the subject of heated, inaccurate exchanges — as Congress tries to reach a deal on giving legal status to undocumented migrants who arrived in the United States as children, known as Dreamers. President Trump has argued that chain migration has benefited terrorists, while Republican hard-liners say it could reward those who have broken immigration laws. Some Democrats have inaccurately characterized attempts to limit what they call “family reunification.” Here’s an assessment. Under current immigration law, American green card holders can sponsor their spouses and unmarried children for permanent residence. Additionally, United States citizens can petition for residence for their parents, siblings and married adult children. It is implausible that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the attack in October in Manhattan, enabled 22 to 24 people to immigrate to the United States. He immigrated to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan, married another Uzbek immigrant in 2013 in Ohio and fathered three children in the United States. And as a green card holder, he would not have been able sponsor any extended family. Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group that favors more limits on immigration, said he was unsure what Mr. Trump was referring to in Mr. Saipov’s case. But “it’s obviously not the relatives” sponsored by the attacker, Mr. Krikorian said, given the waiting period and limits to family-based immigration. Theoretically, had Mr. Saipov obtained citizenship, he could have petitioned for his parents and three sisters (whose spouses and children under 21 could have also immigrated with them) to gain residency. Even in this hypothetical, it would have taken more than a decade for Mr. Saipov to sponsor 22 to 24 relatives. Because there are numerical limits for family-based immigration each year, there is a long queue for visas. (As of Nov. 1, more than 3.9 million people were waiting in line.) After a petition is filed and approved, would-be immigrants are essentially handed a ticket number called the “priority date” and can only apply for a green card when the State Department calls their number. The waiting period can last a few months to more than two decades, depending on the country of origin, the sponsor’s immigration status and the applicant’s relationship to their sponsor. In January, for example, Uzbek immigrants sponsored by American-citizen siblings could begin to apply for a green card if their priority date was before June 22, 2004, a waiting period of 13.5 years. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas argued on the Senate floor on Monday that immigrants who came to the United States as children could petition their relatives for green cards, including “the very parents who brought them here, in violation of the law, in the first place.” Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, in an interview this month on Bloomberg, estimated that giving legal status to some 800,000 people who entered the country as part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy could lead to an influx of “three to four million” potential relatives when “multiplied by chain migration.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Brat said the congressman based his estimate on research showing one immigrant could lead to an average of an additional 4.2 people coming to the United States, with higher numbers from South and Central America. That figure comes from a 2008 book on chain migration by Bin Yu, a professor at Rhode Island College. In an interview, Mr. Yu said he believed chain migration also included the American-born children of immigrants, whom he included in his 4.2 immigration multiplier average. It should be noted, however, that people who are born in the United States are generally given American citizenship. By confining so-called chain migration to foreign relatives, Mr. Yu’s research shows that one immigrant could result in the sponsorship of an average of 2.1 additional people. Marta Tienda, a Princeton University professor and an author of a 2013 study that updates Mr. Yu’s work, said it was inaccurate to just apply the estimated multiplier to the Dreamer population. Her study estimated that each immigrant sponsors an even higher average of relatives — 3.45 — but she emphasized that included all immigrant groups and was driven by employment visas holders, who are much likelier to be naturalized and sponsor foreign relatives. “You can’t just multiply by 800,000. That’s crazy,” Ms. Tienda said, adding the average number of relatives sponsored by Dreamers would “absolutely be much lower” than 3.45. To apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, and must have proof of having arrived in the United States before 16. So their children are likelier to be American citizens, and their spouses also legal residents, citizens or Dreamers themselves. If Dreamers are given a pathway to citizenship through legislation, their parents could indeed eventually obtain legal status. But those who entered the United States illegally are required to leave the country and wait three or 10 years before applying for an immigration visa. That’s “a significant barrier most would be unlikely to contemplate,” according to the Migration Policy Institute. Because these factors, the Dreamers would sponsor, on average, about one family member over their lifetime, the institute estimated. Representative Adriano Espaillat of New York characterized chain migration as parents who want to “reunite with their children.” Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez of Illinois defined it as immigrations petitioning for their spouses. Republicans are not suggesting the elimination of family-based immigration, but rather limiting it to a so-called nuclear family — that is, a set of parents and their children. Over the summer, Mr. Trump endorsed a bill sponsored by Mr. Cotton that eliminates family-based immigration for parents, siblings and adult children. But the bill would still allow American citizens and green card holders to sponsor their spouses and children under 21. It also establishes a visa class for foreign parents to visit their children who are American citizens. House Republicans introduced a similar bill on Wednesday that limits family-based green card programs to spouses and children who are minors. In 2013, the Senate passed a bill that also eliminated visas for siblings and married sons and daughters over 31, and instead established a point-based system for their immigration. No Democrat voted against it. Though the House did not consider that legislation, Mr. Gutiérrez was a sponsor of a bill with similar provisions that year, despite characterizing Mr. Trump’s demands to end chain migration and to build a border wall to limit immigration as “ransom.”",6931
5a4c2b0895d0e0246f21ef5d,2018-01-03T00:59:50+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/politics/fact-check-trump-aviation-safety.html,Politics,"WASHINGTON — President Trump claimed undue credit on Tuesday for keeping the skies safe. “Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter. Mr. Trump’s claim came on the heels of two reports that there were no fatal commercial passenger jet accidents in 2017; however, there were several fatal crashes involving smaller planes. The Aviation Safety Network said there were 10 fatal charter and cargo plane accidents last year, and To70, a Dutch aviation consulting firm, noted two fatal accidents on regional airliners in Angola and Russia. “President Trump has raised the bar for our nation’s aviation safety and security,” Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said in a statement. Mr. Shah cited Mr. Trump’s push to privatize air traffic control and the Department of Homeland Security’s guidelines for enhanced screening of passengers and electronics on flights bound for the United States. A bill proposing air traffic control privatization has stalled in Congress, so it is implausible that it had any effect on airline safety — in the United States or anywhere else in the world. The last fatal accident in a passenger plane operated by a domestic airline was in 2009, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, when a commuter plane headed for Buffalo crashed, killing all 49 people on board. The enhanced screenings were meant to deter terrorism, but fatalities on airlines in 2016 largely resulted from crashes, To70 reported. Of the seven fatal accidents that occurred that year — on Somali, Nepalese, Emirati, Egyptian, Bolivian and Pakistani airlines — four were caused by bad weather or technical malfunction and one by a suicide bombing. Two are currently under investigation. None were bound for the United States. Adrian Young, a consultant at To70, called last year’s rate “a case of good fortune” and noted that there is little statistical difference between two accidents and 10 accidents considering there are tens of millions of flights a year. Harro Ranter, the chief executive of the Aviation Safety Network, said he was not surprised by last year’s lower numbers, given that the number of fatal accidents has consistently decreased over the past two decades. “It’s impossible to link the worldwide level of safety directly to recent U.S. policy changes,” Mr. Ranter said. “U.S. efforts have been instrumental to get to where we are today, but it takes years for policy changes to reach effect, and only in conjunction with other efforts by the aviation industry.”",2650

I muttered these words to my PC during a recent test of three of the most popular shopping comparison Web sites: Shopzilla, Yahoo Shopping and Shopping.com. I was looking for a red sweater for my wife, Karen, and a digital camera for my son Elias. Lately, these sites have made much of their ability to scan millions of products at thousands of online retailers, turning up the right item at the lowest price. So I typed ""red sweater"" into the search box of Shopzilla. Sure enough, I was instantly greeted by models wearing lovely, inexpensive red sweaters. The models, however, were two retrievers, a poodle, a Yorkshire terrier, a Chihuahua and some other lapdog whose breed was beyond my ken. Comparison sites have evolved far beyond where they were a few years ago, when they acted merely as price sleuths for geeky products like hand-held computers and MP3 players, but they are still working through obvious glitches. Most of the trouble involves so-called soft goods like clothing, home furnishings and other items that these services started taking aim at last year, when the population of female online shoppers began racing past men. But to their credit, the sites have improved in other ways: by helping shoppers determine the trustworthiness of an online merchant and by comparing items side by side. So while the sites may not be as refined as they could be, they're not, shall we say, mutts. I quickly clicked away from Shopzilla's ""pet supplies"" section to the site's ""clothes"" category, and retyped my search. The results page included 15 sweaters -- and a pair of diamond rings from HSN.com -- in addition to the option of going to the ""red sweaters"" department within women's sweaters and vests. The red sweaters page also offered me the option of narrowing my search by price range, sweater type, brand, material and other categories. I chose cashmere sweaters from $40 to $80, and received 13 results. Now I was getting somewhere. The stores, which included Bluefly, HSN.com, Cabela's and SmartBargains, among others, were either companies I had heard of, or they had green smiley-face icons near the store name, indicating they had received generally positive customer reviews from BizRate, an online data service operated by Shopzilla. I liked the Hayden berry crewneck sweater on Bluefly, so I typed in my ZIP code to find out the product's final price, but that feature did not work with the Bluefly items on the page. (Sweaters from other retailers showed the final price.) I added the sweater to a ""shopping list,"" now common on comparison sites, where I could judge it alongside other items or save it for later. Yahoo Shopping did not make me sift through canine couture to find a sweater for my wife, but it did force me to refine my search entirely on my own by tweaking search terms. The results featured 3,835 matching items for ""red sweater,"" 188 for ""red cashmere sweater"" and 13 for ""red cashmere women's sweater."" Yahoo also includes merchant reviews, but they are voluntary, and sometimes there is just a handful of them. Shopzilla's reviews from BizRate are from random surveys of a store's customers, and must have at least 20 reviews from the previous 90 days to issue a rating. Some merchants on Yahoo do, however, feature a ""buyer protection"" icon, guaranteeing refunds in case of fraud. Shopping.com addressed my red sweater inquiry by showing me items in both the ""clothing"" and ""sport and outdoors"" categories. Two of the sweaters were red. Happily, though, Shopping.com let me sort the sweaters by price, fabric, brand and style. I chose cashmere sweaters again, from $60 to $80, and received a list that included many of the items featured on Shopzilla, but with the taxes and shipping included. Images on the actual product pages were smaller than those on Shopzilla, and customer reviews, from Shopping.com's Epinions.com, were, like Yahoo's, thinner than those on Shopzilla. As clunky as these sites were with apparel, they were solid for camera searches. I set my sights on a digital camera with at least three megapixels and 4x zoom lens from a reputable merchant -- important because the Internet is replete with scammers who trade in gray-market electronics products. On Shopping.com, I typed ""digital camera"" into the search box, and refined the results by choosing my price range, $200 to $300. I then chose my megapixel preference, and winnowed the list to 54 cameras. I further refined my price range, from $240 to $260, and saw 12 products. I checked the box next to three of them, then clicked on the ""compare products"" button to view more than 50 product specifications for each, side by side. Of the three, the Canon PowerShot S30 had the most, and best, product reviews, so I clicked the ""compare prices"" button. Unfortunately, prices were $300 to $400. My second choice, the Canon PowerShot SD110, was available at BeachCamera, which had a ""trusted store"" icon near its name. I clicked on the customer ratings and sorted them to view the most recent lowest ratings, and read enough rants to shake my confidence. On Yahoo, I refined my search by price, megapixels and zoom, but the list was still 126 items long. Yahoo does, however, include not just user reviews, but also reviews from PCWorld, among other sources. Still, the range of prices was so wide that the information was only marginally useful. Back to Shopzilla for the final camera check. Just before choosing my megapixel specifications (3 to 3.9) to narrow the field of 500 cameras, I noticed a Canon PowerShot A95 with five megapixels, from $265 to $570. The lowest-price merchants received either poor or mixed customer ratings, but when I sorted the list for the A95 by ""total price,"" including shipping, the top price was $289.95, from BlueSwitchDigital.com. The listing included the ""smart choice"" icon, denoting the lowest price from a store that bears BizRate's certification for high customer service ratings. Even at BlueSwitchDigital, though, the lowest ratings had narratives that scared me, including stories of having to call to confirm an order, then enduring aggressive sales pitches for add-on items. For me, the truly smart choice would be to consider a different merchant or perhaps make a purchase with my seat belt fastened.",6295
4fd25a6b8eb7c8105d807021,2004-12-07T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/business/businessspecial/07SALK.html,Retail,"CONSIDER the beach balls for sale at the 99 cents Only store at Wilshire and Fairfax Boulevards in Los Angeles, not far from the Beverly Hills line. The uninflated toys are not made of the classic orange, green and red panels. Instead, these are white, purple, green and blue and imprinted in giant letters ""99 cents Only."" Who would want such a thing? Five years ago, when 99-cent and one-dollar stores were considered the province of lower-income Americans, not many people would have admitted to patronizing such low-status outlets. But these days, a lot of drivers of BMW's, Mercedes-Benzes and Rolls-Royces are carrying the beach balls with other under-a-buck merchandise to their cars parked in the lot outside. ""You have a lot of Beverly Hills matrons coming into that store,"" said Eric Schiffer, president of the 220-outlet chain in the southwestern United States. It's the chain's busiest location, having sold more than 10 million items this year. Target, with its famous designers adding curves to toasters, has been hip for years. But cheap chic has now descended the final rung. Call it 99-cent store chic. From Family Dollar to Dollar General, from Just-A-Buck to 99 Cent Planet, many consumers who could afford to shop elsewhere are proudly spending their time and their money at less dolled-up retailers. A recent study commissioned by a large American dollar-store chain in the East found that 32 percent of the cars in its parking lots were what it called ""A-class"" vehicles, less than two years old with no dents, said Craig Childress, director of prototype design research for Envirosell, which conducted the study. The findings surprised him at first, Mr. Childress said. Now he argues that what brings well-heeled shoppers to discount stores is the thrill of the hunt, that amid the bric-a-brac they might find some hidden treasure. ""The object you buy can be like a trophy you can show your friends,"" he said. ""And then you show them the price."" Trophies include more than beach balls. This holiday season, 99 cents Only is offering 15 varieties of wine with corks, not screw-tops, said Mr. Schiffer, who also added that in a blind taste-test of under $5 wines conducted by The Los Angeles Times last year, one of his came out on top, thumping even Trader Joe's Charles Shaw brand. ""We beat Two-Buck Chuck,"" he said, using the brand's well-known nickname, ""and we're half the price."" At Everything 99 Cents or Less, in the East Village in Manhattan, the offerings not long ago included faux-bamboo picture frames, old-style school composition books, 12-packs of fruit-punch-flavored candy canes and two-packs of toilet-paper rollers. Ivan Tarrazo, 37, was leaving with packing tape and envelopes for his online retail business, and said he had been at the shop a few days before, poking around for fun. ""I ended up getting these strawberry cookies from Brazil that turned out to be good,"" Mr. Tarrazo said. ""And some herbal toothpaste from Turkey that was also very good."" Michael Gurven, a professor of anthropology at the University of California at Santa Barbara who has studied foraging practices among the Ache tribe in the Paraguayan rain forest, said human foragers often seek items that cost little to acquire but promise big status points when given away or displayed. Mr. Schiffer said that his stores have added merchandise like golf balls, cellphone accessories and gourmet foods to appeal to upper-income customers. The traditional lower-income customers still expect to find staples like cleaning products and off-brand canned foods. Mr. Childress warns that discount stores should not cater too much to the rich, like imitating an Apple store by removing all clutter. ""When people are having the great hunt as the motivating factor, it changes things,"" he said. ""We have stores where you get wonderfully lost, and around every corner is surprise."" The Envirosell study found that 75 percent of shoppers visit their local dollar store at least once a week, and that 95 percent of those who enter the store buy something. This ""conversion rate"" compares with 25 percent for mainstream apparel stores and 80 percent for mass merchandisers like Kmart, Wal-Mart and Target. Speaking of Target, the vanguard of cheap chic, it provides crowning evidence that the dollar-and-under moment has arrived. This fall, it added the ""1-Spot"" to the front of its stores, a section where merchandise like stationery, toys and baby products will change completely every six to eight weeks, each costing one dollar. The new area will provide lots of surprises, said Lena Michaud, a Target spokeswoman. ""It's a part of the fun of shopping.""",4657

To make sure I got one I really liked, he took me to a watch store so I could pick out my favorite. Big mistake. I stared at the cases full of watches, several hundred at least, and freaked out. Arranged in no particular order, the watches all looked the same. How could I possibly find the one that was right for me? What had started as a sweet gift suddenly became an intimidating chore. My husband rescued me. Knowing my taste, he pointed out three or four likely candidates. With a reasonable number to choose from, I quickly selected one. Whether shopping for watches or jeans, salad greens or bathroom faucets, consumers have many more options than ever before. The variety of choices today gives us a much better chance of finding something that exactly suits our needs, our personalities, our activities and our bodies. We don't have to settle for the lowest common denominator or one size fits all. But those choices can be overwhelming. Sooner or later, every shopper has an experience like my watch-buying breakdown. Our brains lock up, and we just want to go home. The stress is particularly great when we're buying unfamiliar goods, spending a lot of money or picking out something we'll have to live with for years. In the book ""The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less,"" Barry Schwartz, a psychology professor at Swarthmore College, emphasizes the downside of freedom and variety. ""As the number of choices grows further, the negatives escalate until we become overloaded,"" he writes. ""At this point, choice no longer liberates, but debilitates. It might even be said to tyrannize."" Social critics like Professor Schwartz see the plethora of choices today as a market failure -- the latest sign that commercial capitalism is bad for us. He's nostalgic for the good old days when he didn't expect his jeans to fit perfectly, but it only took five minutes to buy a new pair. Of course, back then, those of us with less standard figures couldn't find any jeans at all. Giving up variety means making people with unusual tastes or needs much worse off. And nobody is average in every dimension. We all enjoy the ability to personalize our world. Fortunately, consumers can escape the tyranny of too many choices without sacrificing the pleasure of finding the right match. As options proliferate, so do new forms of mediated shopping -- experts and tools that narrow the possibilities to a manageable number of likely candidates. That's what my husband did with the watches. It's what real estate agents, financial planners, search engines and the recommendation services at Amazon.com and other sites do. Each knows something about us and something about what's available. They don't just reduce the number of options. They do so intelligently, with an eye to what we're most likely to want. They help us be ourselves. ""The options are paralyzing until somebody who knows what they're talking about comes in, and you realize that most things aren't really as good as you think they are,"" said Kim France, editor in chief of Lucky, a magazine devoted to shopping. ""I know it because I know what the clothes are like when they come here."" She said that some clothes may be too expensive, or some may be made of inferior material. ""These are the things that any woman realizes when she goes shopping,"" she said. Lucky itself offers a form of mediated shopping. Readers flip through the magazine at their own pace, much like looking at a Web site or catalog, and mark the items that inspire them. Unlike the artistic but hard-to-make-out portraits of impossibly expensive gowns in traditional fashion magazines, Lucky's photography is ""very literal,"" Ms. France said. Instead of being ""about tweed"" or ""about gold lamé,"" the fashion articles have practical themes, like how to look chic even when it's freezing. Yet ""the magazine about shopping"" never actually talks about going into stores and buying things. Instead, Lucky celebrates today's plenitude of goods, while creating order out of potential chaos. ""When we show things on a page, they all make sense on the page together, so you're not looking at this crazy mix,"" Ms. France said. ""It's all been edited."" For Lucky's audience, shopping is fun -- and frequent. Choices are more stressful when they're infrequent, expensive and emotionally charged. That's when we really need mediated shopping, if only to give us someone besides ourselves to blame if things go wrong. Hence, the rise of wedding planners, a profession that barely existed 20 years ago. As the constraints of tradition have loosened and the bridal market has produced more alternatives for everything from invitations to limousines, weddings have gotten more complex and personalized. ""Everybody is looking for that little twist,"" said Salli Goldstein, a wedding consultant in Dallas. ""The cookie cutter is gone,"" said Gerard J. Monaghan, president of the Association of Bridal Consultants, an industry group in New Milford, Conn., whose membership has grown to 4,000 this year from 27 in 1981. He estimates that there are about 10,000 wedding consultants practicing in the United States, a tenfold increase over 25 years. While some brides hire a wedding planner simply to keep track of the details or to recommend reliable vendors (itself a form of mediated shopping), others need creative guidance. ""Many brides have no idea what is possible for their wedding, and a good wedding consultant can help them define and realize their dream,"" said Joanne M. Kersten of Le Glacé Events in Dallas. Defining and realizing a dream -- and particularly a dream home -- is the plot of many television makeover shows. While they are largely fantasy, especially when it comes to time and budget, they reflect a changing reality. These days, the average person has home décor choices once available only to the wealthy and well connected. ""The days of only through the trade, those have been pretty much eclipsed,"" said H. Don Bowden, an architect and interior designer in Mobile, Ala., and the former president of the American Society of Interior Designers. Interior designers act less like gatekeepers, earning commissions by marking up products, and more like consultants, helping clients make satisfying choices and getting paid directly for their time and talent. ""Our clients come to us armed with more information,"" Mr. Bowden said. ""But that's also part of their problem -- that they're too informed. So what they want is someone to tell them what questions to ask."" Andy Bowman, an engineer and consultant in Fairhope, Ala., and one of Mr. Bowden's clients, says he and his wife do much of their shopping online. ""All you've got to do is type in 'sink,' and you get 90,000 choices,"" he said. That sounds overwhelming, but Mr. Bowman says that the couple narrowed the options by specifying ""a double sink with a built-in drainboard."" Once they made their selection, Mr. Bowman said, ""We would use Don as a source of affirmation,"" asking whether the feature would work well in the house. ""Don was great at being able to say yes and no very quickly and plainly."" This intersection of high-tech shopping and high-touch reassurance has transformed Faith Sheridan's interior design practice since she moved to Portland, Ore., from Omaha three years ago. Busy young professional couples who do their research online find her through the referral service of the American Society for Interior Designers or her own Web site. ""They are comfortable with hiring a quote-unquote professional to guide them,"" Ms. Sheridan said, ""just as they would hire an accountant or they would hire a financial planner -- people who have specific training. They look to a designer to guide them in these purchases.""

HOMESONGS -- Adem. (Domino, $13.99.) This British singer-songwriter has a warm, slightly croaky voice, and on his lovely solo debut album, he surrounds his strummed guitar with little bells and other stray sounds. (It's recommended for Coldplay fans who might like something quiet and spookier.) These whispery indie-rock songs take hold in a gentle, yet ruthless way.

JULIE ROBERTS -- Julie Roberts. (Mercury Nashville, $13.98.) Ms. Roberts was responsible for one of the year's best country ballads, an aching but resolute lament called ''Break Down Here.'' The song comes from her debut album, which is filled with elegant and often clever country love songs.

HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB -- U2. (Interscope, $13.98; deluxe edition with DVD, $22.99.) For its latest plunge into questions of mortality, faith, love and hope, U2 arrives with guitar riffs, panoramic sound and some of the best melodies of its career. The band has reclaimed the pealing sound of its 1980's albums while expanding its ambitions.

CONFESSIONS -- Usher. (LaFace, $18.98.) Minimal tracks and maximized emotion are the ingredients for Usher's ''Confessions.'' He's still a Casanova, but ''Confessions'' also dips into the guilty consequences.

PRINCE OF COOL: THE PACIFIC JAZZ YEARS, 1952-1957 -- Chet Baker. (Pacific Jazz/EMI, $38.98.) The 1950's were the trumpeter Chet Baker's prelapsarian period, and these excellent sessions capture a durable, iconic pop melancholy. This three-CD sampler corrals the best of Baker, and some of his work with Gerry Mulligan.

DUKE ELLINGTON: THE CENTENNIAL COLLECTION -- (Bluebird/BMG, $19.98.) The remarkable music Ellington recorded for RCA -- starting in the 1920's, but at its best in the early 1940's -- has been collected in this sampler of 13 tracks with a seven-track extension of unreleased live music from 1941. Paired with a bonus DVD of Ellington's ''soundies'' (essentially music videos) from the 30's and 40's, it's a great present for a jazz beginner.

HANDEL ARIAS -- Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. (Avie Records, $19.98.) If I had to choose a single record of the year for 2003, it would have been the Bach solo cantatas by Lorraine Hunt Lieberson from Nonesuch, and this Handel disc is every bit as fine. Ms. Hunt Lieberson can be fierce when the music demands it, but the lulling numbers are quite simply otherworldy.

BELLS FOR STOKOWSKI -- University of Texas Wind Ensemble. (Reference Recordings, $17.98.) I couldn't be more surprised to find myself recommending a recording by a wind band, but the sheer joy the Texas students, led by Jerry Junkin, take in music-making, is utterly irresistible, especially in Tylman Susato's collection ''Danserye.''

I get 188,000 hits. Be still my heart!!! ""So I search 'vintage Hermès scarf,' and get 19,000 items. Linked to eBay is an Hermès Vintage 1962 SS French Line Silk Scarf. The bid is $112.50, but there's a note: 'Reserve price not met.' "" 'Vintage' is clearly the ticket, although the prices are hardly stable. An Hermès crocodile bag, at $900, finally went for $1,375. An Hermès ostrich tote, in chocolate brown, the most gorgeous thing on earth -- bidding up to $985. ""Also a Classic Vintage Chanel Suit From a Las Vegas Entertainer's Estate. Owned by a Frenchwoman who appeared on the 'MERV GRIFFIN SHOW.' This was perhaps not vrais CHANEL. 'Anyone that is a true Chanel wearer knows Chanel only uses 100 percent silk for their silk-lined items -- never acetate,' one MICHELLE K. WARD wrote. 'Also, the few that are muslin- or cheesecloth-lined are those for cruise or summer weight.' ""Well, I felt such admiration for Michelle K. Ward that if I'd had her number, I would have called. But I poured another and raised my glass: here's to you, SISTER! ""Then I got to thinking: it's 5 a.m. I'm alone, a smidge blue, my invitations lost, and I go online and there's a world of women out there just like me. Then I realize something else. That fabulous Hermès tote. All I had to do was challenge its authenticity, sign my name and the other buyers would flee! It was a true crisis of conscience. I had the good Gimmé on one shoulder, in a Chanel and MANOLO stilettos with a halo, and the bad Gimmé, holding a red pitchfork and wearing a bad VERSACE copy. ""Anyway, just as I am writing my Buyer Beware note, the good Gimmé jabbed me in the ear with her heel and said: 'Gimmé, you idiot! That is obviously authentic Hermès. If you sign such a note and someone from the fashion world sees it, no one will ever give you, uh, I mean work with you ever again.' ""Talk about your wake-up call! So I just flicked the bad Gimmé from my shoulder like a piece of lint. My Hermès bag sold for $985, by the way. ""This diamond brooch? From an online dealer. I mentioned I was writing a story about the luxe Internet, and next thing you know, he sends me a prezzie. ""Virtue is its own reward, no?""",3676

You can buy it at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., because Fantasy World never closes. ""Our sort of business, some people like to shop in the night,"" said the smiling salesclerk one recent night. He provided only his first name, Joe. (He is Roman Catholic, he said, and doesn't want it to be known where he works.) But Fantasy World is essentially it, as far as all-night shopping options for clothing go, even in the city that is said to never sleep. For those given to shopping in the wee hours, who never understood how friends could so easily turn to catalogs and the Internet, giving up the visceral thrill of hunting, handling and smelling merchandise, it may seem strangely unfair that few stores have rewarded your loyalty by staying open later. You could shop at L. L. Bean's flagship store 24 hours, 365 days a year. But not everyone lives within a short trip of Freeport, Me., or within striking distance of a 24-hour Wal-Mart. So you must learn to meld your late-night shopping needs to what is available. A trip to Lowe's home improvement store in Brooklyn one Friday night provided a glimpse of who, exactly, was out shopping late, making do with what was open and why. There was a small crowd at the paint counter. But, among the storage baskets, appliances and decorative lighting, there were even more shoppers who just wanted to browse. ""I had no idea stores like this were open,"" said Georgia Kokolis, 37, as she surveyed rugs around 11 p.m. (This Lowe's is open 5 a.m. to midnight.) Ms. Kokolis, who is from Canada but lives in New York, said that she and her fiancé were driving by when they saw the Lowe's sign and decided to stop. Judy Alvarez, 52, who had stopped in with her husband, Ernesto, to get ideas for Christmas gifts, found the store manager to tell him that she had nearly stepped on a dead rat on the street outside the store. (A hazard of any nighttime venture in New York.) Mrs. Alvarez, in a trembling voice, said that she would become a daytime shopper. Most customers said that they worked until the evening on weekdays and loathed weekend crowds, leading them to shop in the late hours. ""After I go home and cook dinner and come back out, you have less of the public to deal with,"" said Cheryl Darlington, 34, a social worker who lives in Brooklyn whose shopping cart included a shower-curtain rod and gardening supplies. Ms. Darlington said that sometimes on Friday nights she shops at Macy's as late as she can and then heads to a 24-hour supermarket to do her grocery shopping. Which was fine with her 9-year-old son, Roshawn Brooks, who was all too delighted to accompany her this night, delaying his bedtime. There are some things you must accept about night shopping, at any store. There will be clerks who are available to help you. If there is a parking lot, there will be plenty of parking. And despite a few boxes in the aisles as clerks restock the shelves, there will probably be ample room in which to maneuver. Once you get used to these luxuries, it's hard to return to the weekend afternoon crunch, said Jon Harris, 47, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, and was pushing his cart, unobstructed, through Lowe's shortly before closing. His girlfriend, Hope Menaker, 55, of Brooklyn, agreed. She described a date a few years back that ended at 2 a.m. with an impromptu dance in the aisles of the Brooklyn Home Depot, just because. But that was another boyfriend. And Home Depot now closes at midnight.",3656

SplashShopper is one of the most elaborate and complete. The $20 program lets users categorize shopping into lists for books, wines, groceries, clothing, gifts and other items that have already been entered by the manufacturer. (You can add to the items as well.) Custom drop-down headings in each list let you quickly pick among the store names you have put in yourself, reminding you where the item can be found and, in the case of a gift, the recipient and the price. If the user notes while shopping that an item is available in several stores, only the cheapest location is displayed in the device. When the item is purchased, it disappears from the list. While the program helps create and manage lists, it does not help speed shoppers through the aisles. For that, consider Aisle Cruiser, a $15 program that learns your shopping patterns and makes them more efficient. While cruising the aisles, the $8 Coupon Keeper can help you keep track of coupons that shoppers often forget to use. List the name of the coupon, its value and expiration date, then sort based on name or expiration. One failing is that the program does not sort coupons by the amount they save. Discount coupons are rarely available for buying diamonds, but the $10 RockShop shareware program may save amateur jewelry shoppers money. Put in the so-called four C's that determine a diamond's worth: carat, clarity, color and cut, and RockShop will display what it thinks is a fair price for the stone.   ERIC A. TAUB",1605

Ms. Montgomery, who has just moved from her Times Square environs to a space twice as big in Sunnyside, Queens, shops in Midtown stores like Kenneth Cole, Benetton and H&M during her lunch hour. After work, she surfs the Web to furnish her home. ""For things you can't try on like posters and lamps, it's great,"" she said. ""Or for clothes that are insane bargains."" Or not. Faced with technology that lets Americans shop every minute, even august retailers like Bergdorf Goodman are jumping into the new age. In just three months of selling on the Internet, Bergdorf has received orders from 49 states, with only Alaska left untapped. At 3 a.m. a few days ago, a shopper in Talent, Ore., bought a $1,000 Badgley Mischka handbag covered in feathers. Two hours later, another night owl bought a $475 pair of suede Robert Clergerie pumps, size 8. ""Customers are becoming much more comfortable shopping at home,"" said Marshal Cohen, senior researcher at NPD Group, retail consultants. At home. At work. In big boxes. In places you never thought of five years ago. Shopping today can be a seamless experience that begins when you wake up -- quick, start your day with a television shopping show -- resumes with a discreet scan through the latest eBay listings at your desk and continues when you slip out for an afternoon latte and come back with Christmas mugs and a cappuccino machine. In the car, swing by Home Depot for the late-night special on a Makita portable table saw. Then it's time for a sybaritic wallow in holiday catalogs -- here's a bargain on linen-colored Egyptian cotton towels -- and a chance to peruse glossy new shopping magazines like Lucky and Shop. One way or another, retailing has a huge impact on the economy, representing roughly 24 percent of gross domestic product. Last year, sales in stores were almost $2.5 trillion, up $120 billion from the year before, but barely keeping up with inflation. Americans have become both avid luxury consumers and diehard bargain hunters, economists say. At this paradoxical juncture, the Internet has become a powerful force -- accelerating both trends. Within the last five years, shopping and the way things are sold have been caught up in perhaps the biggest retail revolution since the advent of the Sears, Roebuck catalog. Each year, more people shop on the Internet, and economists and social scientists are rushing to study the effects of what they call the shifting channels of distribution. Scott A. Neslin, an economist at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, just finished a paper on the changing ways Americans buy. What he found underscores the complexity of the new environment: Internet shoppers have less loyalty to a particular virtual ""store"" than they do to a real store or even to a particular catalog. That is because the amount of human-to-human interaction is reduced. ""When a merchant doesn't have the sweater you want in the color you want, it's much easier to just flip to another site,"" he said. Melissa Payner-Gregor, chief executive of Bluefly.com, agrees that old-fashioned stores have their advantages. Bluefly just opened a temporary store in Manhattan's SoHo. ""The consumer feels that if there's a flagship store it lends credibility to the whole thing,"" she said. Staying nimble and attuned to customer sentiment may be the only way to succeed because, despite all the different ways to shop, the pie has not gotten much bigger, said Mr. Neslin's colleague, Kusum L. Ailawadi, who teaches retail econometrics at Tuck. And price competition, she said, has taken consumer goods ""past the point of diminishing returns"" for the whole economy. F. A. O. Schwarz, the venerable toy store, went broke trying to beat Toys ""R"" Us on prices. So when Schwarz came back this Christmas season, it decided to raise prices and offer ""differentiated"" toys, many customized for their young customers. You can now pick your own Steiff purebred plush dogs, for example, complete with a certificate from the American Kennel Club. (Puppies, the catalog says, can be delivered later.) How easy it seemed when there was just one big mall near your house; with Saks Fifth Avenue at one end, J. C. Penney at the other. Only a short time ago, there were not only established shopping hours but also established shopping seasons: back-to-school, Christmas, Easter. Now experts say the Easter and back-to-school shopping seasons have almost disappeared, and Christmas may not be far behind. The Christmas gifts have changed, too, from mostly clothes and fragrance -- remember the invariable striped tie for Dad, the cologne for Mom? -- to electronics or gift cards for the whole family. Many malls are turning into what developers call town centers or lifestyle centers, supposedly friendlier words to lure those for whom the word ""mall"" has become anathema: endless corridors with splashing fountains, plastic food courts and creepy Muzak. Today's shopping centers have restaurants you can park next to and every teenage-oriented specialty chain imaginable. Moribund department stores have been replaced by multiplex movie theaters and Cheesecake Factories, with condominiums clustered on the outskirts. Women, who used to shop as recreation, now shop more like men, said John D. Morris, a retail analyst with Harris Nesbitt, who writes an annual report on shopper trends. In his research gathered through ""shopalongs"" with groups of consumers in the last six months, Mr. Morris found that ""women used to be gatherers, now they are shopping like hunters."" They know what they want and they have a list of goods found in catalogs, checked on the Web and verified in the stores for quality and fit. For department stores, this is merely the latest challenge. Department store chains still sell $62 billion a year, about 25 percent of the country's clothes and home furnishings, according to NPD. But that figure has not grown, as older customers died off and younger customers started deserting them for new specialty retailers like Sephora, an international chain that sells makeup and perfume (once the exclusive province of the department stores). Teenagers, wooed by Pacific Sunwear and Hot Topic, told pollsters they wouldn't be caught dead in a department store. Their parents had long ago succumbed to the Gap and stores like Talbots and Eddie Bauer. And increasingly, the whole family shops at Wal-Mart and Target. Shopping preferences do not necessarily reflect income, either. In a recent study by the American Affluence Research Center in Pinecrest, Fla., individuals who made at least $359,000 a year picked their favorite stores. The women's choice? Sixty-one percent chose Target. Sixty percent of the men picked Home Depot. Men and women liked Costco next. (Nordstrom was ranked No. 4; Saks Fifth Avenue, 14.) Burt Tansky, the chairman of Neiman Marcus, was there when the department stores started losing their touch. ""If you roll back 30 years, the department stores were everything,"" he said. ""They held the world, they sold clothes and furniture and stoves and typewriters. Then they started abdicating: to Home Depot, to Circuit City, who realized there was an enormous void. At the same time, they gave up on service."" To recapture this lost trade, and, they hoped, gain a new generation of shoppers, America's best-known department stores first tried slashing prices, then learned painfully that they couldn't beat the discount stores at their own low-price game. About 18 months ago, the stores, almost in unison, got out their hammers and drills. Influenced by Selfridges in London, they started trying to bring ""entertainment"" and ""differentiation"" into their environments because shoppers were telling pollsters all the department stores looked alike and had the same merchandise. Elaborate cornices and wrought-iron staircases buried under layers of Sheetrock were exposed at Marshall Field's. Boutiques were installed to sell pens made out of rare wood, the hottest bicycles and even pets and accessories. At Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, executives are debating a computerized check-in, like those at some Las Vegas casinos, offering deals and discounts to shoppers who spend over a certain amount in their establishment. All of them say they are installing more help desks and better fitting rooms, and leather-seated hang-out areas for uninterested spouses to read their newspapers. Is it possible to make the downtown stores a destination again? Happily for them, there are still women like Elissa Hutner, a lawyer who calls herself an inveterate shopper. ""I love going to the stores, putting things together, spending two weeks finding the perfect blouse to go with an outfit,"" she said. ""And it's more fun if it's a real bargain, and I have gotten some real bargains in my time."" She calls shopping a project, especially if she has a special event, like a wedding. ""I go to Bergdorf's, Saks, Barneys, maybe Searle -- all the high-end places to see what they have, and sometimes I find the bargain right there. But usually, I go to the discounters: Filene's, Loehmann's, Century 21."" Yet even Ms. Hutner has responded to the late-night allure of the televised shopping shows. ""I started buying jewelry on ShopNBC,"" she said. ""Oh, and I bought a vacuum cleaner, I think it was on QVC. And I shopped for kitchen hardware and curtain rods, because they're a pain in the neck to schlep home. I've even bought books. But I still enjoy going to a bookstore."" However seamless the new world of shopping may appear, there are still snags. Ms. Montgomery, the paralegal who moved to Queens, said the Internet provided a way for her and her mother, a retired college professor in North Adams, Mass., to shop together again. ""My mom called me up,"" she said. ""She knew I was looking for a rug and she told me to look at one on the Linens 'n Things site and I liked it, too, and I ordered it."" But the living-room rug, a 5-by-8-foot wool Heriz, still had not arrived. Federal Express had delivered it to the wrong address and would try again the next day. ""It's frustrating,"" she said, ""but I really couldn't have gotten it home in a taxicab."" She sighed. ""No matter how you do it, shopping is still hard.""",10439
4fd2414a8eb7c8105d7d962e,2004-12-07T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/business/businessspecial/07HAYS.html,Retail,"FIRST there was a town house filled with goods from the Midwest, a quiet presence in TriBeCa. Then came a slightly louder storefront showcasing home furnishings in Rockefeller Center. Finally, during the dog days of summer, a two-story glass box full of cat food and mewling felines materialized on Fifth Avenue, across from the massive stone lions flanking the New York Public Library. All three were examples of pop-up stores, a marketing trend that tries to build buzz around products or test their appeal by parking them, temporarily, directly in front of consumers. The more consumers, the merrier; Times Square is a favorite with pop-up marketers, and so are busy airports. The fleeting nature of these stores, most of which are in business for a month or less, may be a factor in their popularity, as shoppers rush to visit something they only have two weeks to experience. Take the Chris Madden store created by J. C. Penney for a month last May. The company rented ground-floor space in a building in Rockefeller Center, where pedestrians could easily take in the displays. Furnishings were arranged by categories -- adventurous, romantic and serene -- and Ms. Madden, who has an exclusive product license with J. C. Penney and is considered a Martha Stewart-like instructor in the domestic arts, made appearances as well. ""It was all about making things really easy for you and taking the fear out of decorating,"" said Amelia Alonso, a company spokeswoman. It was there and gone by June 1. But like most pop-ups, it made an impression. ""Whether it's done by a manufacturer or a retailer, it's startling,"" said Candace Corlett, a partner at WSL Strategic Retail, a marketing consulting company in Manhattan. ""It makes the consumer think 'how clever.' It takes people by surprise, and it gives them another reason to think about you, and, most important, to think about you differently from a 30-second commercial."" That was the hope of Matthew Glass, president of the New York promotional agency Grand Central Marketing, when he conceived of a store filled with Meow Mix cat food that came into being for two weeks this summer. Outside was a big sign that said No Dogs Allowed. Inside was an assortment of cat toys and cat food, especially a new wet variety that Meow Mix was introducing. ""The goal was to make this a big splash,"" Mr. Glass said. ""We said: 'Let's treat it like a movie premiere. Let's get people out in line, waiting for it.' "" A vacant storefront on Fifth Avenue was painted orange inside and bedecked with feline merchandise. A cafe was installed, where cats could sample tuna-flavored food and their human companions could nibble on tuna canapés. Activities for the humans were set up; a popular game was Hairball Toss, in which supersize replicas of the feline nuisance were tossed into baskets. Mr. Glass invited people and their cats, and held an opening night starring Eartha Kitt. ""She's a real cat lover,"" he said. Thousands of people came the first night, and more lined up on the sidewalk with their cats the next day, waiting for the store to open. The reception -- all right, it was the middle of August -- surprised even Mr. Glass and Richard Thompson, the chief executive of the Meow Mix Company who had greenlighted the project. ""When Al Jazeera in the Middle East has shown the clip twice, you know everybody in the world has seen it,"" Mr. Thompson said. Now he is making plans for Meow Mix Café, redux. While most ad campaigns promoting new products can run into the millions, pop-ups like the Meow Mix Café cost only about $150,000. ""So, for a fraction of the cost for a new product launch,"" Mr. Glass said, ""companies not only get more visibility, they get an invaluable amount of buzz."" Target got to Manhattan first in 2001, filling a TriBeCa town house with the store's merchandise. Shoppers could peruse the wares and order them with the help of Target employees who were standing by, said John Remington, the company's vice president for marketing. ""It's another way of getting the Target sensibility in front of a guest who may not have been in a store,"" he said. ""And to get media attention."" Target followed up the next year by docking a large boat filled with selected products at Pier 62 on the Hudson River. Visitors could pick up any items they liked from inventory housed on a pier nearby. Last fall, the company opened a temporary store in Rockefeller Center devoted to products designed by Isaac Mizrahi and sold only at Target. In time for Memorial Day, Target spruced up an old house in Bridgehampton, N.Y., loading it with brooms, porch furniture and other wares that the weekend homeowner, driving eastward, might want or need. By the Fourth of July, the store had closed. ""We're not looking at pop-up stores so much as a strategy as what is the next big idea we can do to connect with our guests,"" Mr. Remington said. In October, Target created a pop-up store in Times Square devoted to breast cancer awareness, replete with pink bicycles, pink flip-flops and pink doughnuts served from a coffee cart outside. ""It elevates your feelings about the brand, because so many things have become so boring,"" Ms. Corlett of WSL Strategic Retail said. Older companies, struggling to redefine themselves for younger generations of consumers, might benefit in particular from pop-ups. ""For every brand, it's kind of a dream to get off the shelf and take over the store,"" Mr. Glass said, reminiscing about the vanished Meow Mix Café. ""We were able to do that here.""",5519

And that means the annual hunt for the perfect gift, a prospect that makes some of us break out in a cold sweat. That this is a daunting experience for so many people is obvious from a quick Google search. When I typed in ""gift giving advice,"" more than two million sites popped up, teeming with practical tips about buying gifts for anyone -- from your boss to your best friend's pet. Is giving a gift really that hard? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be yes. A 2003 American Express survey of 803 consumers found that nearly a third of respondents admitted to recycling a gift they had received. That's a lot of people who are not thrilled with their presents. An artist friend told me, with admirable but not entirely convincing calm, that he discovered one of his paintings he'd given as a gift up for auction on eBay. Of course, I didn't ask him what he was doing on eBay. Gift giving is, among other things, an exercise in empathy. The successful present is a mark of how well you know a friend -- his likes and dislikes. Of course, this requires suspending your own tastes, something easier said than done. I wonder if it's possible for you to buy something you don't want yourself just the slightest bit. Even if you pass the empathy test, you are not out of the woods. A truly great present has to do more than affirm your friend's interests; it should anticipate and enlarge them. When my sister was 12, I remember how thrilled she was when my grandfather gave her a subscription to National Geographic. She had no clue at first that this was an interest, but photography and travel became her twin passions. O.K., I admit that's a tall order. Can't a gift ever be just a gift? Not a chance. Whether you buy a present for a co-worker, a new friend or a lover, dark psychological and economic forces are apparently at play. ""When I buy a gift for my kids or my wife, I suppose I don't just want to surprise them but also show them how clever I am at discovering such a wonderful gift,"" my friend Nick told me recently. Whoever said gift giving is an act of altruism? Certainly not many economists, who view it, at least on the surface, as an irrational act. After all, if I am willing to spend $100 for a gift, the odds are high that the recipient will value it at less than $100, which is a loss for both of us. This discrepancy in value that givers and receivers place on gifts was coined ""deadweight,"" by Joel Waldfogel, a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who wrote about it in a 1993 paper called ""The Deadweight Loss of Christmas."" The logical conclusion would seem to be to give money and dispense with all this guessing. Perhaps it makes strict economic sense, but psychologically, it is just a sneaky way to make the other person buy his own gift, which would subvert the point of giving a present. Let's be frank, though: some people view a gift merely as an investment. As a tradition, that has a long past. Just a few hundred thousand years ago, an impressive gift was probably a necessity to secure a choice mate; whoever took down the biggest mastodon got the prize. We may have come a long way since then, but some things never change. According to a 2003 study by Dr. Gad Saad, an associate professor of marketing at the John Molson School of Business at Concordia University in Montreal, men on the whole are more likely than women to give gifts for so-called tactical reasons: to flaunt wealth, to seduce, to create a good impression and to signal long-term interest. Men just can't help themselves. Not surprisingly, the women in the study understood with deadly accuracy the reasons why men offer them gifts. As you can see, it is probably not a good idea to think too much about your presents. When you open your gift, be gallant and say, ""You have no idea how much this means to me!"" One way or the other, you will be telling the truth. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to Tiffany & Company. I have some seducing -- I mean shopping -- to do.",4134
4fd2414a8eb7c8105d7d962f,2004-12-07T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/business/businessspecial/07ELLI.html,Retail,"STEVEN GILLIATT, president of G2 Worldwide, a leading brand development and design consulting company in New York, recently had an up-close-and-personal demonstration of the increasing power of eye appeal in retailing. ""I was buying an iPod a couple weeks ago and there was a feeding frenzy at the store,"" Mr. Gilliatt said, referring to the Apple Store in SoHo, where customers jostled one another to buy the special edition iPod loaded with music by the rock group U2. ""I was there as a civilian, but I'd been converted from consideration to purchase,"" he said, borrowing jargon from marketing mavens. Mr. Gilliatt's response to the innovative design of the Apple Store -- so cool it is now being described as a ""singles mecca"" in The New York Post -- indicates the importance of intangible elements in selling goods ranging from apparel and personal-care products to entertainment merchandise and housewares. The product's design, the packaging and even the style of the store are now weapons in the marketing arsenal, as much as traditional tactics like television commercials and print advertisements. ""There's a lot of competition out there, and everyone needs to be differentiated,"" said Erik Ulfers, senior vice president for environmental design at Jack Morton Worldwide in New York, which specializes in what it calls ""experiential communications,"" which range from the NBC Experience Store in Rockefeller Center to the opening and closing ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in Athens. The goal is to generate ""an emotional moment between a consumer and a brand,"" Mr. Ulfers said, adding: ""It sounds a little goofy, a little abstract, if you talk about it too much. The big challenge is to dimensionalize the aspects of a brand -- what a brand is, who it wants to be -- and use the visuals to support the story about that brand you want to tell."" Eye appeal has become more crucial in the last five years, said Jim Lucas, director for planning and research at Draft in Chicago, a direct marketing agency, part of what he termed the ""popularization of design,"" or ""design for the masses,"" brought to life by name-brand designers like Michael Graves and Philippe Starck for retailers like Target. ""What has started to happen as a result,"" Mr. Lucas added, ""is that people have come to expect a certain level of design from their products than before,"" citing iPod's success and the Mini Cooper. ""Design works at different levels, not just on functionality,"" Mr. Lucas said. ""It also works at a visceral level, as the color, the shape, attract one's attention, not just as eye candy but in a more reflective, associative way."" The store itself is now ""one of the key elements of the marketing mix,"" Mr. Lucas said, as retailers like Wal-Mart seize more power from the manufacturers who once had the upper hand by running advertising that drove customers into stores. ""Retailers now are the choice editors, whereas in the past the manufacturers were,"" he added, naming chains like H&M, Ikea and Pottery Barn. As a result, a store's environment is acquiring an importance once reserved for, say, the script of a commercial to be run during the Super Bowl. ""The outside is the new inside,"" said Peter Arnell, chairman and chief executive of the Arnell Group in New York, an advertising agency that has branched into design. ""It's all about sensory experience. The retail theater closes the deal,"" said Mr. Arnell, who once studied architecture with Mr. Graves. For one advertising client, Reebok International, the Arnell Group designed a flagship store in Philadelphia meant to personify the company's new Rbk footwear and apparel line by converting, as Mr. Arnell put it, ""the beats and rhythms of sports into a three-story retail space."" And Jacob Arabo, a k a Jacob the Jeweler, the purveyor of bling-bling to the hip-hop aristocracy, is getting an Arnell Group design for his first store, at 48 East 57th Street in Manhattan, which is intended to invoke the interior of a gem mine. For the Sharp Corporation, the Wieden & Kennedy agency in Portland, Ore., sought to offer consumers a three-dimensional version of a global brand campaign for Sharp's Aquos liquid-crystal-display television sets. So the agency conceived the Aquos Project, a public gallery that is open through Dec. 24 at 137 Wooster Street in SoHo in Manhattan. The gallery, managed by Lime Public Relations and Promotion in New York, features the works of an artist, Kenzo Minami, and a design studio, Tronic, which are partly displayed on -- of course -- Aquos televisions. ""It comes down to a membership program, if you will,"" Mr. Ulfers of Morton Worldwide said, ""making a brand's constituency feel like members with a sense of inclusion."" For all the interest in eye appeal, conventional advertising ""is not going to go away, certainly not in our lifetimes,"" Mr. Gilliatt of G2 said, because it is ""important for getting people in the store."" Still, ""marketers are recognizing there's a huge opportunity,"" he added, ""for making design, packaging, lighting, display and other in-store elements, work harder at the point of purchase to create emotional connections, so all our contacts with the consumer are more focused and powerful. ""Let's put it this way,"" Mr. Gilliatt said, ""in the Apple Store, there was a lot of emotional connecting going on.""",5327

While most people sleep, Mrs. Hinton patiently helps her night-owl customers by offering gift ideas, decades of customer service experience and perhaps a measure of companionship and understanding. ""People may call at night if they're lonely, or they've got the kids in bed and they have time to place an order,"" said Mrs. Hinton, her voice calm and unfailingly polite. ""They've got everything taken care of at home, and now is when they can find a little more one-on-one time."" With so many opportunities to shop amid the anonymity of the Internet, catalog shoppers at any hour who bother to pick up the phone to place their orders are often seeking more than a quick transaction. This is particularly true at night, when the friendly customer service representative might be a shopper's only form of company. ""What they will divulge to you is amazing,"" says Magy Nakkashian, director of customer care at the skin care company Murad, in El Segundo, Calif. ""They want to tell you all about their lives, their divorce, their recent surgeries. I've even had agents referring their callers to drug rehab."" Catalog companies receive the majority of their phone orders during the day, but the all-night call center is a service that consumers have grown to expect. For some customers, a patient voice late at night is the main reason they shop by catalog, rather than over the Internet or at retail stores. ""There is a reason that catalog companies are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and that is because people do shop in the middle of the night,"" says Amy Blankenship, a spokeswoman for the Direct Marketing Association. ""I can't think of an example of a catalog company that doesn't have 24-hour order lines. It is available because people are very busy and simply do not have the time to shop"" during business hours. Fifty-eight percent of Americans shop from catalogs, with the average shopper placing 11 orders a year, the association says. During the last holiday season, they spent an average of $150 an order. The advent of toll-free telephone numbers in the late 1960's helped the rise of all-night call centers just as more women went to work outside the home. Today, the typical catalog shopper is married, female and 51 years old with a household income of $53,000. She lives in the suburbs, is employed and shops by catalog for convenience. For the Lillian Vernon Corporation, calls that come between midnight and 6 a.m., the shift Mrs. Hinton works, tend to be longer than calls during other business hours. ""People are much more chatty, and certainly in less of a hurry,"" said David Hochberg, vice president for public affairs. ""They're not late for an appointment, they're not taking care of their kids, and certainly the sales reps have more time to devote to the customers at that hour as well."" Although Lillian Vernon, which sells gift and household merchandise, will have more than 436 sales representatives taking phone orders during the day this holiday season, only a dozen operators will be working the overnight shift. Shoppers who call the company at that time are often retirees and people who are not working on a rigid schedule and need to hear a friendly voice, Mr. Hochberg said. Consumers who call Frederick's of Hollywood, the racy lingerie and apparel catalog, tend to have a more direct sense of purpose when they shop in the late hours. ""They're often seeking instant gratification,"" said Tracy Rhyan, a senior manager for direct marketing at Frederick's of Hollywood, meaning they are looking for the perfect thing to wear for the weekend and are more likely to ask for expedited shipping. Ms. Rhyan described the attitude of a typical after-hours shopper as: ""This is what I want to be wearing, I want to order it and I want it now. I've got a date and I know what I want to wear."" But that doesn't usually mean shorter calls. Like many catalog shoppers, late-night customers seem more leisurely. ""They are likely to ask more questions about the fabrics,"" Ms. Rhyan said. That pace is one thing that Mrs. Hinton says she likes about the overnight shift. Working then allows her to be home when her daughter arrives after school, and she doesn't feel as harried. She's also heard her share of personal information. ""It's just an opportunity for them to vent,"" Mrs. Hinton said. ""I let them finish, and then I say, 'I understand, but is there anything else I can help you with?' """,4602

Each rap of a salesman's ballpoint signaled the sale of a diamond ring or a pair of cuff links. It intoned happiness and solvency, and, since Tiffany was not the sort of place to expose a customer to the indecency of baring his wallet in public, it summoned a manager, who performed the actual transaction at a discreet distance. Tiffany stopped the practice of pen tapping almost 10 years ago; you probably didn't even notice. For one thing, people aren't embarrassed by the sight of money anymore and, for another, they don't have time to wait for the manager. They slap their credit cards on the counter, and there's no need to soften the blow with hushed voices. Today, in fact, the most persistent sound in luxury shopping is the mouse click. From now until the end of the holidays, Tiffany.com will receive 100,000 hits a day, roughly equal to the number of people who will visit a Tiffany store. If mass retailing has been transformed by the availability of better-designed products, like Michael Graves teapots at Target, class has been transformed by technology and a consumer who is as well informed as she is impatient to have the latest gaud. Half the purchases on Neiman Marcus's Web site are by customers who do not live near one of its actual stores, said Brendan Hoffman, chief executive of Neiman Marcus Direct, which also operates the Web site of Bergdorf Goodman, a Neiman property. Designers who travel the trunk-show circuit, selling their new clothes like Fuller brushes, have long known about the wealth in this country. But the Web has given merchants an unlimited portal to the rich, and changed the meaning of notions like status and exclusivity. ""We're selling Chloé, Manolo Blahnik, Dolce & Gabbana,"" Mr. Hoffman said. ""We see no price resistance on the Web."" Not long ago, the Neiman site offered Giorgio Armani's Le Collezione label, which has women's suits for around $1,200. The line sold out in less than a month, Mr. Hoffman said. The speed of information has also induced consumers to buy earlier, giving merchants a greater chance to sell more goods at full price. ""We saw some of our biggest purchases this year between Aug. 15 and Sept. 15,"" said Brian Bolke, an owner of Forty Five Ten, a boutique in Dallas, where some customers spent as much as $20,000. Speed also agitates demand for special and hard-to-find products. Stores like Bergdorf's and Barneys New York now offer more small labels in their mix to woo shoppers who are turned off by the ubiquity of big brands -- and the media buzz around them. ""Our customers want more individuality,"" said Robert Burke, the fashion director at Bergdorf's. But this desire for the hidden and seemingly exclusive helps even established designers. Oscar de la Renta had a $40,000 sheared mink jacket in his fall line. ""We thought we'd sell a few,"" said the company's chief executive, Alex Bolen. ""We sold 40."" Of course, the notion of trading up -- exchanging one identity for a better one -- has been going on in this country since the Mayflower. In their 1992 book, ""Channels of Desire: Mass Images and the Shaping of American Consciousness,"" Stuart and Elizabeth Ewen point to the influence of silent films on the lives of immigrants. Such films, the Ewens said, supported a crucial myth in American culture, ""metamorphosis through consumption."" But the consumption ethic, it can also be argued, remained relatively static for decades, drawn as much by rigid economic lines as by class distinctions. The rich had their own playgrounds, their own style of life, and while they sought the best clothes and the best food, they didn't try to surround their exquisite taste with a term like luxury. They certainly didn't think of luxury as an exploitable commodity, the way Ralph Lauren began to do in the 70's. As Slim Aarons said of the socialites he photographed in the 50's: ""I didn't do fashion. I did the people in the clothes that became the fashion."" What brought the barbarians finally to the gate was branding. Things had been moving in that direction since the mid-60's, around the time Life magazine published a list of the 100 most influential New Yorkers and included the names of a few designers and Pop artists, a notion that would have been too ridiculous to contemplate a decade earlier, when such figures were considered outside the elite establishment. But the real explosion came in the 90's with the emergence of superbrands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Although credit has been given to Tom Ford and Domenico De Sole, who left Gucci in April, for stimulating consumer demand at the high end -- largely by limiting distribution and then feeding the frenzy for ""it"" handbags with waiting lists -- Mr. Ford recognized a crucial change in modern tastes. Namely, all the energy, all the excitement (and a great deal of the money), was coming from the bottom -- from the worlds of indie rockers, rap artists, celebrities, even porn stars. A luxury brand might be aspirational, but it can't afford to be perceived as elitist. ""In luxury today, it's so much more about having a bottom-up identity,"" said Nancy Koehn, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ""The top has to marry itself with the bottom, because the elite at the top aren't that important."" The Internet is also anti-elitist, as journalists who left magazines for online publications discovered. Not only was conventional media slow, it wasn't interactive or personal enough to satisfy all the different segments of readers. For luxury retailers, the challenge is how to leverage their prestige without appearing snobbishly out of touch. Neiman's, for instance, is developing custom home pages. Tiffany's Web site shows how engagement diamonds are cut and set, believing that consumers want more for their money than the luster of a name. Big brands undeniably offer security. ""You know that Chanel is going to be around for a while,"" said Jane Buckingham, president of Youth Intelligence, a company that surveys trends. But safety in numbers carries its own threat. Brian Bolke of Forty Five Ten, the Dallas boutique, suggests that specialty stores like his -- and Tracey Ross in Los Angeles and Linda Dresner in New York and Birmingham, Mich. -- serve as a filter. ""I'm sure that Prada has the biggest influence of any brand,"" Mr. Bolke said. ""But if you go to a party and there are seven other women in the same Prada dress, you might as well have gone to Gap."" No two designers are more alert to the cloning factor than Miuccia Prada and Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel. That's why they keep upping the ante each season with looks that are novel or hard to copy. Compelled by an affluent shopper who gets her information about a collection hours after it is shown, who makes her purchases earlier and earlier, they have no choice. To be slow in fashion these days is to be out of the money.",7000

Mr. Brayton, who sells lighting fixtures and chandeliers from his shop in Ocala, Fla., loves eBay's ability to bring in customers. But he finds the auctions a hassle. Instead of dealing with those, he sells his items on eBay Stores (stores.ebay.com), where he can list inventory for longer than seven days and sell it at a fixed price. ""Less than 10 percent of our items are at auction,"" Mr. Brayton said. ""To tell you, honestly, the auctions are strictly advertising."" For those who think ""auction"" when they think of eBay, Mr. Brayton's strategy may come as a surprise. But ever since the advent of the Buy It Now option in 2000 and the opening of eBay Stores in 2001, commissions and fees from nonauction sales on eBay have become a significant part of the company's revenue. For the last two years, nearly 30 percent of the gross merchandise volume traded on eBay has been exchanged at a fixed price. Meanwhile, many sellers and a few longtime analysts of the company say the trading method that has made eBay famous -- its online auctions -- is generating fewer of the bidding frenzies that once translated into profits. ""The novelty of having to compete with someone is wearing off a bit,"" said Jonathan Garriss, the executive director of the Professional eBay Sellers Alliance, a trade association made up of 600 of eBay's top sellers. EBay does not provide sitewide statistics on the average number of bids its items attract, and although many sellers say they have seen a softness in the auction market, their tales are only anecdotal. But the observations do re-evaluate eBay's evolution. The company is an auction site dependent on what one analyst called the ""thrill of the hunt."" Yet it is also running an online shopping mall catering to quick routine sales. Can it be both and continue to excel? EBay is quick to say yes. It grows every quarter, continues to turn profits, has 125 million members and was the most-visited online shopping site on Black Friday, the shopping day after Thanksgiving. Its stock price has soared to about $116 this week from $55 in December 2003. Most industry analysts say they like its expansion into the more traditional shopping realm. Without its fixed-price sales, eBay's ""earnings power would be a lot less, its valuation would be a lot less and its share price would be a lot less,"" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst for American Technology Research, a boutique research firm in Greenwich, Conn., which evaluates technology companies. EBay, he said, is one of his top stock picks. But the praise for eBay's move into fixed-price sales does not negate the risks. The company's brand name is built on auctions, and most analysts agree that it can be dangerous for a company to move away from its base. What many people are watching closely is how eBay's membership will change now that it is attracting sellers and buyers who want a more traditional shopping experience. ""This is where there is some conflict,"" said Derek Brown, an analyst at Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco, who has been watching eBay since 1999. Fixed-price selling is usually associated with commodities, or products that are so common that those with the lowest prices are the most likely to be bought. ""Auction selling is more effective in a market in which an item is unique or there is an unknown value associated with it,"" Mr. Brown said. ""The question is, are buyers coming to eBay for unique items or more commoditized items?"" Think back to eBay's origins as a site for collectors of Pez candy dispensers. Those collectibles epitomized the kinds of products that have made eBay irresistible to millions. They were vintage items whose value could be discerned in a global online auction. Today, many sellers still live for the excitement of trading an item whose value might soar beyond expectations. And buyers admit that they can get caught up in the game. ""The experience of the purchase sometimes transcends the value of what they are buying,"" said Adam Sarner, an analyst with the Gartner Group, a research company in Stamford, Conn. But now eBay's membership includes a segment of people with a different mind-set. These sellers are not trying to market rare treasures. They want to move merchandise. And they have found a growing group of eBay buyers who value the immediacy of a purchase over auction excitement. Many of the eBay Stores -- now up to 224,000 -- sell multiple copies of the same thing. For example, Mr. Brayton's eBay store, Let There Be Lights and ThangZ, sells pineapple-shaped patio wall sconces, five of which were available last week. (On the site, Mr. Brayton says he first got started on eBay by selling ""dead inventory,"" items that had not sold, for a real lighting store.) Other eBay Stores run the gamut from overstock distributors selling last year's designer handbags to first-time sellers who have found a niche buying highly specialized items from suppliers and reselling them from their homes. Printing and mailing catalogs would be too costly, but on eBay, sellers can tap into an international market for much less. Mr. Garriss of the professional eBay trade group sells women's shoes on eBay and runs a retail site at www.gothamcityonline.com. His retail business is doing well. ""We see that growth accelerate while our eBay auctions have stayed flat,"" Mr. Garriss said. Joe Cortese, founder of the eBay sellers group, who sells antiques collectibles on eBay under the name Noble Spirit, said he had heard the same thing from other sellers. ""The customer's need for convenience"" -- the ability to make an immediate purchase -- ""outweighs the original enthusiasm we saw in auctions,"" he said. One seller, Amit Vora, in Los Angeles, said he was struggling so much with his eBay auction business that he planned to leave eBay in a few years, after he built up his own retail site. Mr. Vora started on eBay in 1998 (as DiaGemInc) to supplement sales at the wholesale manufacturer he works for, Diamond and Gemstone Promotional Jewelry. He had become so faithful to auctions that he set all his opening bids at 99 cents, although some items were valued at thousands of dollars. The point, he said, was to generate enthusiasm and, with luck, bidding wars. In 2000 and 2001, he said, the strategy worked. He could list a one-carat diamond ring, say, and it would go for $1,000 to $1,500. ""That sort of thing has come down now to $400,"" he said. ""Now people are asking, 'Why are you selling diamonds for $1?' "" he added. ""Before, we didn't need to explain that."" It is hard to know what might be causing business problems like Mr. Vora's. And there are people on eBay who say that their auction profits are rising, not falling. But eBay has another answer for critics who worry that it has started to lose sight of its grass-roots marketplace. For one, said Chris Donlay, an eBay spokesman, the idea to allow fixed-price sales ""came from the community,"" Mr. Donlay said. ""They said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to do this?' "" Beyond that, Mr. Donlay said, someone who takes a close look at what sells on eBay, regardless of method, will see that the site is not trying to compete with Amazon.com or any other online shopping mall. The majority of the goods on eBay, he said, still fall under the category of ""hard to find."" Even some collectors are finding that fixed-price sales can work. For example, Sheryl Williams in Pillager, Minn., has opened an eBay store called OnePreciousPlace to sell porcelain figurines from the Precious Moments collection. She said that during November she was selling items rapidly in her store, even though she had not listed an auction item for three weeks. EBay remains a site for ""consumers selling to other consumers,"" said Mr. Sarner of the Gartner Group. Someone can still take an old watch from a drawer, he said, and trade it to anyone anywhere. Whatever eBay's mix of fixed price and auctions, he added, the company is probably on the right track ""as long as there's the chance to get that watch for 99 cents.""",8091

These postmidnight buyers -- who include insomniacs, night owls and people who like to work late -- seem to be taking advantage of high-speed Internet access in the home. About 5 percent of online sales take place from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m., according to Coremetrics, a company that tracks online customer behavior. ""People are clearly going home, having their dinner, putting their kids to bed and sitting at the computer,"" said Toni Sikes, chief executive of Guild.com, a Web site that sells hand-crafted arts and furniture. The trend may be accelerating, said Chuck Davis, the chief executive of Shopzilla, a shopping search engine. Mr. Davis said that he recently observed that the peak hour when Shopzilla visitors clicked from the search engine to a merchant's Web site was 12:30 a.m. Eastern time. ""It's a new phenomenon,"" Mr. Davis said of the surge in late-night shopping. Unlike dial-up service, a high-speed Internet connection is ""always on,"" Mr. Davis added. Some of the larger commerce sites, particularly those with a heavy international customer base, are accommodating this around-the-clock crowd by offering full-time customer service. Amazon.com, for instance, has customer service representatives available by phone 24 hours a day, as does eBay, a site where 46 percent of gross sales are generated by customers outside the United States. ""It's the middle of the day somewhere,"" said Hani Durzy, an eBay spokesman. Ms. Sikes of Guild.com said that her site, although experiencing late-night shopping, has yet to decide whether to extend its live customer support and telephone sales operation all night. The operation stops at 9 p.m. Central time and opens at 7 a.m. Yet Ms. Sikes said that although the number of shoppers is considerably fewer at night, these shoppers may actually be spending more than their daytime counterparts. Night shoppers, she speculated, are able to spend more time on the site and may feel more comfortable buying big-ticket items than if they were making more hurried decisions about purchases during the day, possibly doing so at work. Asked if people may be spending more in the middle of the night because they were sleep deprived, Ms. Sikes laughed. ""I wouldn't suggest that in print,"" she said. But sleep troubles may be one reason people shop after bars have closed and television is showing infomercials. At least that was the recent experience of Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist, an online bulletin board used by millions of people to buy and sell goods. On a recent evening around midnight, Mr. Newmark was experiencing a little jet-lag-inspired insomnia. He logged on to the sites of several electronics retailers, tapping away in his T-shirt and pajama bottoms searching for a new laptop computer. ""I was half asleep,"" he said. ""I just didn't want to go to bed quite yet."" He said he knew anecdotally that many Craigslist users did the same thing. For instance, he said, it is not unheard of for people in the middle of the night to scour the site's free sections -- where items are given away -- to make sure they get first dibs. ""They'll get in the car at 2 a.m. if they hear about something that has just been placed outside of someone's door,"" Mr. Newmark said. The idea of getting a good deal also helps inspire Ms. Moskowitz, the intrepid late-night shopper. She said the one thing that motivated her to troll the Internet at odd hours was when she had received an e-mail message from one of her favorite online merchants advertising a sale. In particular, she said, she gets excited when one of her favorite sites offers a sale that lets her satisfy her most passionate yearning, buying earrings. ""I'm an earring junkie,"" Ms. Moskowitz said. ""I will spend hours going through the entire site looking at earrings and adding them to my wish list."" Meanwhile, with the snoring downstairs, Ms. Moskowitz may want to consider extending her purchase with a pair of earplugs.",4762

4fd280958eb7c8105d84bcec,2004-12-07T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/business/businessspecial/07NAPO.html,Retail,"WEST CHESTER, Pa. - IN her elegant black chiffon dress and her hair swept into an updo, Lena McIlwain looks like one of those Bergdorf Goodman salesladies whose very presence in the store make you believe that if you would only buy that lipstick, that scarf, that whatever-it-is-she's-got-in-her-hands, you, too, would be as gorgeous. It is Friday at midnight and Ms. McIlwain is far from a store like Bergdorf. She is standing on a brightly illuminated corner of a 20,000-square-foot set in the middle of a wooded industrial park here, 30 miles west of Philadelphia, talking to a robotic television camera in the reassuring voice that belies her glamour. That is what makes her welcome in homes at this hour of the night. ""It's a new day here at QVC, and look what we have for you today,"" Ms. McIlwain said to her invisible customers, as if she were about to reveal the winner of the Academy Award for best picture. She had six pocketbooks in front of her. ""You can't find this Dooney & Bourke leather-trimmed satchel in the stores; it's exclusive to QVC. It comes in six beautiful colors, and it's just $174.72, or three easy payments of $58.24."" A spiral staircase snakes up from the set to a control room. Here, Tim Slifer, the overnight line producer, a manager of sorts, is hawking a half-dozen monitors with the intensity of an air-traffic controller. The most important monitor tracks the sales of items in this televised department store. The screen shows that despite the hour, call volume is high. The bags begin to fly off the virtual shelves. By 12:04, four minutes after Ms. McIlwain began discussing the product, 1,156 purses were sold. By 12:05, the total was 2,580. Mr. Slifer whispered into Ms. McIlwain's ear piece that it is ""very busy on the line,"" QVC code for ""Tell the viewers to be patient."" Ms. McIlwain, without missing a beat, admonished viewers to please understand that the phone lines were full. After 10 minutes of selling, Ms. McIlwain had sold 5,132 bags. The dark hours of the night are when most stores stock their shelves or dust the merchandise, but at the home shopping network QVC, every hour of the day is an opportunity to move more products. The 18-year-old virtual store is easy to lampoon, with its always-smiling hosts and beauty shots of twirling cubic zirconium rings. But if you have a product to sell, the department store that never sleeps is a place where you would want to sell it. Last year, QVC sold $4.8 billion of merchandise. ""This is kind of like Vegas -- you don't know if it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon or 2 o'clock in the morning,"" said Rick Domeier, a host who has just come off the air from the 10 p.m. to midnight shift. He is relaxing on a Mission-style sofa in one of four green rooms provided for guests, watching his colleague on the TV as she continues to sell. He shakes his head as the sales continue to rise, with not a trace of envy but the enthusiasm of a soccer dad egging on the team. No one at QVC looks at the overnight hours as the graveyard shift, he said. ""When I'm on, it's prime time,"" said Mr. Domeier, a former actor who said he had thought he would spend six months at the TV network and then move on. It has been 10 years, and Mr. Domeier said that in that time he had grown to value the ""emotional connection"" with his viewers. ""As Oprah as that sounds, you want customers to trust you,"" he said. ""When it comes to the selling part, if you go too hard, they'll let you know."" Doug Howe, the merchandising executive responsible for the Dooney & Bourke bags, comes into the green room. He is here late tonight to see how his product is faring. Mr. Domeier congratulates him on the sales volume. Mr. Howe spent 14 years at the May department stores before joining QVC in 2001. ""It's kind of like you've died and gone to heaven,"" he said of the experience. ""Here, it really is about merchandise. In traditional stores, it was about managing the product in the store environment. Here, we sell one thing at a time."" He pointed to the TV. ""That screen is your selling space."" In the financial fourth quarter at a department store, Mr. Howe said, store buyers would often take to the selling floor to hear what customers had to say about the products. At QVC, he said, he gets feedback from customers immediately -- not just from the calls that are placed on-air but from the sales volume, evident instantly on the computer screens throughout the building. ""It's instant gratification,"" he said. ""You learn and react constantly."" The green room is filling up with guests who have arrived at this remote studio to appear on the 2 a.m. show, ""Gifts for the Cook."" A demonstrator who has just flown in from Los Angeles irons his chef's jacket. He will appear to sell ceramic knives. Two other women sit quietly waiting for their call to the set; one will demonstrate a vacuum-pump wine saver, another will talk about a stainless steel casserole with a magnetic trivet. By 1:30, 13,788 Dooney & Bourke handbags have been sold. In a prep kitchen on the other side of the building, a man is blow-torching a turkey to give it that golden brown look. It sits in a ceramic bake-and-serve dish nested in rattan. The creator of the product, Tara McConnell, watches as he readies the display to be wheeled onto the set. Sometime after 2:30 in the morning, she will sell $45,000 of merchandise in just seven minutes. In the hallways, new vendors start making their way to the green rooms to prepare for their time on camera. One has curlers in her hair. A show host named Laurie Shore, a former TV reporter, sits in another room reading up on marcasite jewelry for her 6 a.m. show. She has yet to apply her makeup. And on the computer terminals throughout the department store that never sleeps, evidence mounts of invisible home shoppers as the day's tally grows higher.",5841

After a momentary hush, a woman resembling Cher loudly responds, ""I'm Joan Lacey,"" briskly asking to see furs that fall in her $100,000 budget. A personal shopper who describes herself as ""early 50's,"" Ms. Lacey wears her dark hair long with bangs, and for this shopping trip was dressed in tight jeans, a vintage Armani jacket and leopard-print shirt. She reviews Mr. Basso's wares through blue sunglasses, and after swiftly dismissing several options, inquiring whether he has any chinchilla and carefully examining a dark green $45,000 jacket, she settles on a brown $25,000 bolero with a colorful vintage-fabric lining. She puts the fur on hold, and sweeps out to her waiting Mercedes S600 for the next stop. Coordinating stops with her cellphone, consulting scribbles on scraps of paper for store numbers, Ms. Lacey shouts instructions to her driver, Hector Rodriguez, who has been with her for three years. ""He makes sure to avoid the grates for my high heels,"" she laughs, later adding, ""if I didn't have a driver, at this point in my life I wouldn't be doing this."" Ms. Lacey has made a business of selling her taste and her time to clients who are too busy, or impatient, to shop for themselves and who find the services of a single store limiting. She is one of a small cadre of independent shopping consultants who have found success spending other people's money to enhance the cachet of their gifts -- or their wardrobes. Her stable of 35 customers includes socialites as well as companies ranging from banking to film, and her services vary from picking out cupcakes to arranging $50,000 golf packages as business gifts. At the next stop, the jeweler Kaufmann de Suisse on Madison Avenue, Ms. Lacey eyes a $400,000 pearl necklace, and after musing that her client's wife does not own any pearls, asks to see something under $100,000. This client is the head of a hedge fund in Chicago, she explains, and she's looking for Christmas gifts for his wife. ""Depending on what I see, I might try to get something from both stores."" The owner brings her a $66,000 baroque-style pearl necklace, and after inspecting the diamonds in the clasp, she puts it on hold and has the salesclerk write down the size of the pearls. ""I'm going to talk with my client today, and I'll call you this afternoon,"" she says, before climbing back into her car to go downtown. At her final destination, Links of London, she meets with Sharon Buntain, the company's president and chief executive for North America, to select a gift for the 18th birthday of a client's daughter. Ms. Lacey selects charms for a bracelet, later saying: ""I think I'll do a fashion bracelet, with five charms -- a cellphone, lipstick, handbag, high heels and a cross. She's not really religious, but crosses are sort of hip, and she's Catholic."" Ms. Lacey has the right résumé to be a fashion mercenary. Originally from Ohio, she moved to New York in 1971, where one of her first jobs was working for Bloomingdale's. ""This was when Bloomingdale's was in its heyday,"" she says, ""when people would go every week to look at the windows."" After Bloomingdale's, she worked as a publicist, fashion editor and, eventually, a freelance fashion stylist for videos and movies. ""That's when I really started doing personal shopping,"" Ms. Lacey says. ""Your customers just start asking you to do things."" Although Ms. Lacey has been a personal shopper for a few years, she recently formalized her company, Ask Joan for All Things Stylish, expanding to style concierge service, at the prompting of her best friend, the socialite Karen LeFrak, with whom Ms. Lacey shares a passion for breeding show poodles. ""She's a know-it-all in the best possible sense!"" says the pixyish Mrs. LeFrak. ""One time I even called her on the way home from a dog show in New Jersey because I didn't know what exit to take!"" Over time, Mrs. LeFrak has started referring her frequent queries as ""Ask Joans,"" and the company name was born. Ms. Lacey says that ""personal shopping is personal: that's very important to me. I don't have assistants."" She sees this approach as the cornerstone of her work. ""I research, find out who they are, what they do, what they collect,"" she says. ""If someone collects Georgian jewelry, for example, I can find that. I'm not just a messenger who goes out and gets a bunch of clothes."" Personal work is lucrative: while some companies keep her on retainer, her hourly rate is around $200 (if the customer accompanies her), a rate she is raising. While most purchases go on customer's credit cards ""for tax purposes,"" Ms. Lacey herself wields an American Express Black Card, saying, ""I like it because it doesn't have a limit."" With total annual expenditures by her clients nearing the high six figures, she allows that the $100,000 budget for her client today was an anomaly; some years she might not have any client who wants to spend that much. ""Not all husbands, no matter how much money they have, spend that much money!"" she says.",5141
4fd2414a8eb7c8105d7d9629,2004-12-07T00:00:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/business/businessspecial/07BLAK.html,Retail,"THINK about your favorite retail store. Call it XYZ. On a scale of 1 to 5 -- 1 means you're neutral, 5 means you agree strongly; rate these statements: XYZ always treats me with respect. I feel proud to be an XYZ customer. If a problem arises, I can always count on XYZ to reach a fair and satisfactory resolution. XYZ always treats me fairly. XYZ always delivers on what it promises. XYZ is a name I can always trust. I can't imagine a world without XYZ. XYZ is the perfect store for me. Now think about your bank. Go through the same statements and rate how you feel. Earlier this year in Japan, 16 women participated in a study that measured such responses and determined store loyalty by using a brain scan. The subjects identified their own XYZ -- an upscale department store in Tokyo -- and agreed to a scan while they were asked 32 yes-or-no-type questions about the store, their bank and their daily life. The women, who were 22 to 66 years old, placed their heads into machines that track brain blood flow as the women performed the mental tasks. For example, when people see a face, make a decision, feel a reward, pay attention, sense deception or react to countless stimuli, specific regions of the brain light up. Before entering the scanner, a third of the women revealed that they were passionately loyal customers of XYZ. A third said they liked to shop there but were not fanatical about it. The rest were neutral. During the session, each woman was asked to imagine her most recent experiences at XYZ and at the bank. Everyone had similar brain patterns when answering questions about mundane daily life or trips to the bank, said John Fleming, a senior consultant for the Gallup Organization in Princeton, N.J., which led the study. But those who indicated an extremely strong emotional attachment to the store, as measured by questions like ""this is the store for me,"" showed a distinct pattern. Three areas of the brain -- the orbitofrontal cortex, the temporal pole and the amygdala -- lighted up brightly. All are associated with visual memory and emotion, Mr. Fleming said. The most ""brand addicted"" subjects, he said, showed the greatest activation in the amygdala, which is a sensory gateway to the emotions. ""If the company they love screws up, they blame themselves,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""They ask themselves what they did to contribute to the problem."" Women who were mildly fond of or neutral about the store showed far less activation or no activation in these emotional areas of the brain. The study, carried out at Nihon University in Tokyo, was reported in late October at the Society for Neuroscience's annual meeting, held in San Diego. Marketing and neuroscience are becoming bedfellows. Corporations and advertisers are turning to brain-imaging technologies as a way of learning customer preferences. By peering at brain circuits as people think about products or services, neuromarketers hope to glean what buyers really want instead of what they might say in a focus group or write on a questionnaire. The Gallup study is a variation on this theme. It explored the brains of people who already professed different degrees of brand loyalty. A result is startling evidence that brands can invade the brain's most intimate emotional centers -- and drive behavior. Companies have long known that brand loyalty is important, Mr. Fleming said. Loyal customers buy more, expanding profits. They tend to try new offerings and tell their friends. It costs less to keep loyal customers than to recruit new ones. If a company could turn 5 percent more of its customers into loyalists, with hooks into their amygdalas, profits would increase 25 to 100 percent a customer, said Frederick F. Reichheld, author of ""The Loyalty Effect: The Hidden Force Behind Growth, Profits and Lasting Value."" Marketing executives naturally want to know what creates brand loyalty. It does not stem from flashy ad campaigns, Mr. Fleming said. Nor is it a measure of customer satisfaction, a better-quality product or even a lesser-quality product. What drives behavior in a complex world is often emotions, said Dr. Daniel Kahneman, a psychology professor at Princeton University who shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics. He argues that emotions are important determinants of economic behavior, more so than rationality. To win brand loyalty, companies need to establish strong emotional bonds with their customers. Moreover, this builds one transaction at a time, involving face-to-face contacts. ""A brand is more than a virtual symbol in the marketplace,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""It has a face of the people who interact in the marketplace."" Many corporations are waking up to the fact that their lowest-paid employees are the people who create, or fail to create, the emotional connections that lead to brand loyalty. They are also aware of local differences in how employees engage customers. ""For me, a good example is Continental Airlines,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""I love the airline, but maybe that's because I fly out of Newark. I know people in Houston who do not have the same experience."" It is probably too soon to tell if buying goods on the Internet will lead to similar levels of brand loyalty. A prompt, courteous, cost-competitive Web site could conceivably build loyal customers. But without face-to-face contact and those small touches that mean great service, will America's amygdalas light up in cyberspace? Perhaps a future brain imaging experiment will tell.",5483

5a98d34c410cf7000162ecb6,2018-03-02T04:29:57+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/sports/lebron-james-between-the-legs-mvp-race.html,Sports,"The N.B.A. can sometimes feel like an endless game of one-upmanship, but LeBron James took it to another level on Thursday. A day after James Harden of the Houston Rockets had a highlight for the ages when he faked a player nearly out of his shoes before calmly hitting a 3-pointer, James answered with a play that rivaled Harden’s in terms of court wizardry. James, whose Cleveland Cavaliers were in a tight contest at home against the Philadelphia 76ers, an eventual 108-97 was driving to the hoop when he found himself confronted by one of the few N.B.A. players he couldn’t run through: Joel Embiid, the 76ers’ 23-year-old All-Star center. James was also blocked on his right side, where Tristan Thompson of the Cavaliers was tangled up in a screen with Robert Covington of the 76ers. No matter. James dribbled once to his left, brought the ball around his back, tossed it through Thompson’s legs, and then leapt over Embiid’s outstretched leg and regained control of the ball inside the key. With a clear path to the basket, he finished with a left-handed layup. There will undoubtedly be an endless debate about whether James intended the between-the-legs move, or whether he simply had some good fortune after losing control of the ball. But with James, it’s easy to assume nearly anything he does on a court is intentional, so he has earned the benefit of the doubt unless he says otherwise. Harden’s play carried no such ambiguity — except, perhaps, for armchair referees who declared a push-off or a travel. Early in Houston’s eventual 105-92 victory on Wednesday, Harden was being guarded near half-court by Wesley Johnson of the Los Angeles Clippers. Harden feigned a drive before stopping on a dime to go back behind the 3-point line. Johnson, trying to match the change in gears, ended up falling backward onto the court, leaving Harden without a Clippers player within 10 feet. Harden, the favorite for the N.B.A.’s Most Valuable Player Award, then rubbed the Clippers’ faces in the misfortune by taking his time in setting up the 3-point shot as his teammates went berserk on the sideline. Asked about Harden’s play before his game on Thursday, James gushed about his rival player’s ability. “That was one of those moves that sometimes you dream about having,” James said. “It was a perfect storm, because at that time they were pretty handily winning that game, they were up like 28-7 at that point and gets that step-back — one of his patented moves — and the crowd went crazy, his teammates went crazy. That’s a play that will be in his highlight reel the rest of his life.” The dueling plays came as the M.V.P. race between Harden and James was beginning to heat up. Harden is averaging a league-leading 31.3 points along with 8.9 assists and 5.2 rebounds, and his team has the best record in the N.B.A. James entered Thursday with averages of 26.7 points, 9 assists (a career-high) and 8.4 rebounds a game, but he could get more credit from voters for being the lone constant on a team that has been aggressively rebuilt during the season. James, in discussing Harden’s play, made it clear that when it comes to highlight-reel plays, just about anything is allowed regardless of the egos of those being humiliated. “Listen, man, it’s all part of the game,” James said. “This is a game of showmanship, but at the same time this is a game of swag and whatever you’ve got to do, man. Once you’re in between these lines of 94, ain’t no rules. The only rules is don’t try to hurt nobody purposely.” With both Harden’s and James’s plays, the gauntlet has been thrown down for the league’s other M.V.P. candidates, namely Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans and Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. If they want to keep pace, they will need to come up with something equally — or more — awe-inspiring and stylish.",3840
5a98a017410cf7000162ec63,2018-03-02T00:51:22+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/sports/baseball/dustin-fowler-oakland-as.html,Sports,"MESA, Ariz. — On Sept. 14, 1919, at Griffith Stadium in Washington, a shortstop named Jesse Baker made his major league debut for the Senators. Baker was 24 years old, nicknamed Tiny because he was only 5 feet 4 inches. He started at shortstop against the Detroit Tigers, and Ty Cobb spiked him on a slide into second base. Baker left the game without getting to bat, and never played again in the majors. For nearly a century, that sad tale stood alone as the only known instance of a position player starting his one and only major league game without ever coming up to hit. For now, though, Tiny Baker has company in Dustin Fowler. Fowler started in right field for the Yankees last June 29, on the road against the Chicago White Sox. He was a bit nervous, he said, but that was good; he plays better that way. He had studied James Shields, the opposing starter, and knew to look for sinkers and cutters. “I was in a good spot when I left Triple-A,” Fowler said on Thursday. “I was getting hot again. I felt like some good things were gonna happen.” With two out in the bottom of the first inning, Fowler bolted from his position to chase a foul pop by Jose Abreu. He slammed full-speed into an unpadded metal electrical box along a side wall, rupturing his right patellar tendon with an injury so gruesome it brought Joe Girardi, then the Yankees’ manager, to tears. Fowler would have led off the second inning, but his season had come to a sudden and grisly end. A month later his Yankees’ career ended, too, with a trade to the Oakland Athletics as part of a package for starter Sonny Gray. Though he never expected it, Fowler said, he recognized the opportunity immediately. “Getting hurt there was a big part of getting traded here,” Fowler said, by his locker at Hohokam Stadium. “But I’m happy for it. I think everything happens for a reason. Hopefully I’ll get my debut here sooner than later so I can go ahead and forget about that day.” Fowler has appeared in just one of Oakland’s seven games this spring training, but he is scheduled to play again on Saturday, and every other day after that. He still needs to strengthen his right quadriceps and regain his old two-step burst when he runs. But the A’s want him to win their center field job, and he could be ready by opening day. “He’s hitting every marker,” Manager Bob Melvin said. “You want to make sure he gets plenty of at-bats and does well, but he looks very graceful in the outfield, he’s got a nice swing, he runs well, he’s very athletic — some of the qualities we maybe haven’t had in the past.” The A’s have finished in last place in each of the past three seasons, their longest such streak since the 1940s. Forever trapped in the outmoded, low-revenue Coliseum, they need to take risks to compete with the World Series champion Houston Astros and their other American League West rivals. The Fowler trade qualifies. In moving Gray, whose rights the A’s controlled through 2019, Oakland received a second injured prospect besides Fowler: pitcher James Kaprielian, a former first-round draft choice who is recovering from Tommy John surgery. Jorge Mateo, a shortstop who was not injured then but has a sprained knee ligament now, was the third — and most highly touted — prospect in the deal. “We’ve been through this cycle a lot, in my and Billy’s time together,” General Manager David Forst said, referring to Billy Beane, Oakland’s executive vice president for baseball operations. “We’ve done the up-and-down, and hopefully can recognize when there’s a time to look at higher-upside guys. We’ve made trades for safer guys with a lower ceiling who could impact us sooner, but we were certainly in position last July to go for the most talent regardless of how far away from the big leagues they were.” In Fowler’s case, the A’s had few precedents to study. The injury, Forst said, is more common in N.F.L. running backs than major league outfielders. Yet while Fowler is fast — he had 55 steals in his last two full seasons in the minors — the A’s feel he has enough skills to not depend entirely on speed. “His hands are quick enough that he will drive the ball to all the fields, with gap-to-gap power,” said the Oakland first base coach Al Pedrique, who managed the Yankees’ Class AAA team last season, when Fowler hit .293 with 13 homers. “He’s a very smart player, and defensively he got so much better last year with his routes and jumps. His throwing strength has improved, and his awareness of where to throw the ball has gotten so much better. He can play center field every day in the big leagues.” As a center fielder, Fowler will not have to contend with side walls. He also hopes that his example will minimize risks for other fielders. In January, Fowler sued the White Sox and the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, the agency that owns Guaranteed Rate Field, alleging negligence and seeking compensation for possible lost future earnings. Fowler said the suit was still in progress and had not been resolved. “I’m just looking out for the guy next to me,” Fowler said. “Two outs into my big league career and I’m suing someone, you’d never want to do that. But I wouldn’t want anyone else to have to go through what I went through.” Whatever happens with his case, Fowler will always have a scar and a lonely Yankees stat line — one game and a row of zeros — to remind him of his cruel and unusual introduction to the majors. He wishes he had something else. “The only thing that upsets me is I was so close to it and I wasn’t able to come up with it,” Fowler said. “After an injury, it looks a lot better to actually have caught the ball.”",5640

Jim is a tough and courageous man and we know he will fight this battle with strength and determination.” Kelly, 58, was previously diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in his upper jaw in 2013. He was declared to be cancer-free following surgery but had a recurrence that required treatment through radiation and chemotherapy. Before Thursday’s announcement, he had been believed to be free of cancer since September 2014. After his first experience with cancer, Kelly discussed the lingering effects from the disease and treatment, including difficulty in speaking, the inability to produce saliva and an inability to taste food. Kelly’s family was open about the latest diagnosis, with his wife, Jill, and one his daughters, Erin Kelly-Bean, discussing it on Instagram. “We are shocked, heartbroken, sad, angry, confused, and just darn tired,” Jill Kelly said in her post. “Yet, despite how we feel, we KNOW that God is a promise maker and keeper.” Kelly, who remained a towering force in Buffalo and in the N.F.L. despite all of his Super Bowl appearances ending in losses, said he was relying on what he called the “four Fs”: faith, family, friends and fans. “With all of you by my side we will fight and win this battle together,” he said. “Staying ‘Kelly Tough’ and trusting God will carry us through this difficult time.”",1866

Who can forget Ilie Nastase pulling down his pants and mooning the chair umpire Charles Hare in Palm Springs in 1976? Or John McEnroe at Wimbledon in 1981 screaming, “You cannot be serious, man!” after what he perceived to be an incorrect call, and referring to the umpire Edward James as the “absolute pits of the world”? Or that night at the 2009 United States Open when Serena Williams cursed at and threatened to stuff a tennis ball down the throat of the line judge Shino Tsurubuchi for calling a foot fault, an incident that cost Williams her semifinal match against Kim Clijsters? But tennis tantrums could soon go by the wayside. The ATP World Tour, the governing body of men’s professional tennis, is testing Hawk-Eye Live, an electronic line-calling device that would eliminate the need for line judges. The system will be discussed by ATP leadership and then debated by players and officials during ATP Council meetings at Wimbledon this summer. “In our sport, things change really slowly,” said McEnroe, 59, who played under Hawk-Eye Live during the ATP Champions event at the Delray Beach Open in Florida last month. “But if the technology is there, all you really need is an umpire to call the score. It’s not like it would be the players calling their own lines.” He added that he might have been a better player with no line judges to argue with, “but I would have been more boring.” The current Hawk-Eye system, which made its debut in 2004, acts as a check on human line-calling. Through computer-generated software and courtside integration, line calls are made and recorded but put into play only when a player challenges the validity of a call made by a line judge or the chair umpire. The replay of the ball’s bounce is projected on giant screens around the stadium, generating suspense — and often rhythmic clapping from spectators — until it is determined whether the call was accurate. Each player is allowed three incorrect challenges per set and is awarded another should the set go to a tiebreaker. More than 100 ATP and WTA tournaments use Hawk-Eye, as do all four Grand Slam tournaments, though the system is not available on all courts. (At the French Open, as at other clay events, Hawk-Eye is used only for television broadcasts and statistical analysis as ball marks are more definitive on clay courts than on hard or grass surfaces.) Hawk-Eye Live, which has been in the works for the last two years and was tested at the NextGen ATP Finals in Milan in November and again in Delray Beach, goes beyond the challenge system and makes every on-court call. The system sends visual and audio cues to the chair umpire and off-court monitors within a tenth of a second of a ball bouncing. “The core technology is very similar to Hawk-Eye,” said James Japhet, managing director of Hawk-Eye Americas. “We’ve just added more live elements, like cameras mounted behind the court and looking across the baseline that can detect foot faults. We’ve taken the entire human element out of it.” There is, however, a manned booth behind and above the court, and there will always be a chair umpire on court. In Milan, line judges wearing plain clothes sat in the stands as seat fillers, ready to intervene if the system malfunctioned. One of the biggest issues was determining what sound Hawk-Eye Live should emit in making an “out” call. “We tried horns, buzzers and beeps,” said Gayle David Bradshaw, the ATP’s executive vice president for rules and competition. “We didn’t want it sounding like the buzzer on the ‘Family Feud.’ Finally, we decided to record different human voices yelling ‘out,’ so it doesn’t sound monotonous. We’ll add a different voice for the foot fault call.” According to Japhet, the extra cost to tournaments for upgrading to Hawk-Eye Live will be offset by eliminating the cost of paying, housing, feeding and clothing line judges. Japhet and Bradshaw acknowledged that replacing line judges with technology will not only put people out of jobs, but it will also dehumanize the game a little bit. “I understand that this may kill officiating, especially because our up-and-coming chair umpires are almost always linespeople first,” Bradshaw said. “We’re also taking away some of the entertainment value with the challenges because fans like to debate whether they think the call was right or not. “But we can replace that by showing close calls on the big screens so the fans can see them as replays at the same time the players and officials are seeing them. As far as the players, they no longer have to worry about bad calls; they can just play the game. And if we have a system out there that’s better, don’t we owe it to our athletes to have access to it?” Japhet said Hawk-Eye Live was being used worldwide in soccer, cricket and Nascar racing. Jesse Levine, who competed on the ATP Tour for eight years before retiring in 2014, played the Champions event in Delray Beach using Hawk-Eye Live. He saw the pros and cons. “It’s cool because it’s a computer-generated system, so it’s never wrong,” said Levine, 30, who now coaches the WTA pro Jessica Pegula. “There can’t be any mistakes. You’re not going to argue with a machine. “That said,” he added, “the negative is that there’s not so much interaction with the fans. There’s no cheering during challenges. More important, it’s not in the tradition of tennis. In all these sports, there’s a human element that creates suspense. That’s what the challenge system is for. This is really cool to experience once in a while, but not all the time.”",5670
5a985dd7410cf7000162eb90,2018-03-01T20:08:48+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/sports/ncaabasketball/sean-miller-arizona.html,Sports,"The University of Arizona announced on Thursday that Sean Miller would remain as its men’s basketball coach despite allegations that he had discussed paying a top recruit $100,000. “At this time, we have no reason to believe Coach Miller violated N.C.A.A. rules or any laws,” the university’s president, Robert C. Robbins, told reporters after a meeting with the Arizona Board of Regents. At the meeting, it was also decided that Miller would coach the team on Thursday night against Stanford. The announcement came on a day of high drama at the university. Hours before the Regents convened an executive session to discuss Miller’s employment, the basketball coach called a news conference on campus at which he read a prepared statement vehemently pushing back against the accusations. He did not take questions. “I have never knowingly violated N.C.A.A. rules while serving as head coach of this great program,” he said. “I have never paid a recruit, prospect or their family to come to Arizona, and I never will.” Miller, 49, is among several coaches and players who have been linked to a vast federal investigation into recruiting improprieties in college basketball. The language in Miller’s contract makes it unclear how much money he is entitled to if he is terminated before its completion. An assistant coach under Miller, Emanuel Richardson, was arrested in September on charges of bribery. Richardson was one of four Division I assistant coaches named in complaints filed by federal prosecutors in the United States Southern District of New York. At the time, it was unclear the extent of what Miller knew about Richardson’s involvement or if Miller himself was involved. Last year, Miller signed a contract extension with Arizona through March 31, 2022. The complaint that was made public in September said that Richardson had accepted bribes for promising to use his influence to steer his N.B.A.-caliber players to retain the services of the financial adviser Munish Sood and the former sports agent Christian Dawkins when they became professionals. Last week, ESPN reported that Miller spoke with Dawkins about paying a top recruit, DeAndre Ayton, $100,000 to sign with Arizona. Ayton did join Arizona, and is a front-runner to be selected first in the 2018 N.B.A. draft. The ESPN report, citing anonymous sources, said the conversation between Miller and Dawkins was captured by F.B.I. wiretaps. Soon after ESPN’s report, the Regents announced Thursday’s meeting for “legal advice and discussion regarding the University of Arizona men’s basketball and the multiple-year employment contract for the head men’s basketball coach.” Miller did not coach his team in a loss on Saturday to Oregon. In his statement on Thursday, he called the news reports “inaccurate, false and defamatory.” “These statements have damaged me, my family, the university, DeAndre Ayton and his incredible family,” he added. N.C.A.A. rules say that players who are suspected of being ineligible should be held out of competition until they are cleared. Arizona said in a statement that Ayton was eligible to play. This year, Miller’s base salary is $1.5 million. His contract also outlines additional compensation, which is standard among college coaches, if the team performs well academically, and includes bonuses for winning the regular-season championship and performing well in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Arizona is No. 19 in The Associated Press rankings with a record of 22-7. The Wildcats are expected to be given a top-four seeding in a bracket of the N.C.A.A. tournament.",3571

Since the conclusion of the trial, the entire board of directors of U.S.A. Gymnastics, the sport’s domestic governing body, resigned. A bipartisan group of United States senators asked for a special committee to investigate the scandal. And on Wednesday, the head of the United States Olympic Committee, Scott Blackmun, stepped down under pressure from a group that included Olympians. This weekend, America’s elite gymnasts will compete at the American Cup in Chicago, the first major meet for the women since the implosion of their national governing body. Several current gymnasts have expressed concern that the upheaval within U.S.A. Gymnastics will hurt their careers. Members of the “gymternet” responded to our questions with posts in our comments section, on social media and in emails. Some commenters said they knew Dr. Nassar, either personally or through an online association. Gwendolyn from California, a retired gymnast who competed for eight years, said that Dr. Nassar befriended her online after she wrote to him to ask for help with a persistent injury. “I remember feeling shocked and confused,” she said about reading the initial reports of his abuse. “I didn’t want to believe that the ‘doctor’ that I had briefly come to know could do such a thing. Later learning that he abused over 100 gymnasts, including those whom I looked up to while growing up, I was mortified.” Janae Janik, 22, from Seattle, said she was subjected to emotional abuse by her coaches: “I’ve realized that much of my own struggle with depression, anxiety and an eating disorder stemmed from this abuse.” Ms. Janik was a competitive gymnast in the Junior Olympic system and later for the University of Washington. Ms. Janik said she trained at the same gym with two prominent accusers of Dr. Nassar, McKayla Maroney and Mattie Larson, though she never met him. “The stories coming out in the media are shocking,” Ms. Janik said in an email. “But to those of us who lived it, they’re all too familiar. “A lot of emotional abuse is seen as very normal, and I believe that needs to change through educating both coaches and athletes on what that looks like.” Karen Psiaki from Georgia, who said she competed in gymnastics for 12 years, said she wanted to become a sports medicine doctor because of Dr. Nassar. “It makes me sick to think that I, like so many, idolized him and the entire elite gymnastics world for so many years!” she wrote. Now, she said, “I would think twice about letting my children be part of the elite competitive world unless I could SEE the changes being made and felt comfortable that it was a safe environment.” Many writers acknowledged that they faced abuse as gymnasts themselves. “After taking several months off to rehab an injured Achilles, I was told upon my return that I had developed cellulite on my butt. I was 10,” said Nicole Johnson, a gymnastics coach in Colorado Springs. “Hiding pain, discomfort and struggle had earned me accolades in gymnastics,” said Sarah Payne of San Francisco, who said that her coping strategies haunted her into adulthood. She added that she assumed the same would be true after leaving the gymnastics world. “As an adult, I assumed submitting to authority, never asking for raises or reporting questionable behavior would lead to professional rewards. How wrong I was! We are doing a disservice to our gymnasts by teaching them that silence equals success.” Sarah from New Jersey became a gymnastics coach after participating in competitive gymnastics for most of her youth and “struggled with anxiety and mental blocks.” “I think that’s why I started coaching,” she said, “and why I love coaching and empowering girls so much.” Some parents of gymnasts said they would demand changes in their children’s gyms. “If all of us gym parents don’t start asking those uncomfortable questions, like ‘Can I please see a copy of the gym rules, and do you run background checks on your staff?,’ it leaves our kids just as vulnerable to history repeating itself in the future,” said Karla Fuentes, 36, from Rego Park, Queens. Ms. Fuentes and her husband participate, with their nearly 2-year-old daughter, Anastasia Mikaela (named for the Olympic gold medalists Nastia Liukin and McKayla Maroney, said Mrs. Fuentes), in parent and tot classes at her local gym. Ms. Fuentes said that her gym told her that it didn’t have written policies on background checks for staff or on staff being alone with athletes. “I don’t know why I am afraid of offending the coach for asking for something that should be so obvious, but I am — and I have to assume that other parents are as well.” Ty Schalter, 36, sends his daughter Luisa, 9, to Twistars U.S.A. Gymnastics Club in Lansing, Mich., where many of Dr. Nassar’s victims said they suffered through his “treatments.” The head coach at Twistars, John Geddert, was named by many victims of Dr. Nassar as an enabler of abuse who was himself physically and emotionally abusive to gymnasts. I connected with Mr. Schalter on Twitter after he posted an article he wrote about Luisa. Luisa is a low-level competitive gymnast at Twistars who has never been personally coached by Mr. Geddert, Mr. Schalter said. In a direct message on Twitter, Mr. Schalter said that the mood at Twistars has been dark in the wake of Dr. Nassar’s trial. “There’s broad uncertainty about the future of the gym, and I think most parents feel those who haven’t been around the gym as these stories have come out can’t understand the difficult choices we’ve all been making.” Many parents at other gyms, he said in a phone interview, “want blood.” But he added that if Twistars were shuttered, it would put a lot of coaches out of work, some of whom were victims of Dr. Nassar, and take the sport away from children, some of whom were victims. “That’s not better for our kids,” he said. “Why not show solidarity for the victims?” Mr. Schalter did not believe the scandal was “a one-gym problem” centered on Twistars. “It’s a sportwide culture issue that needs to be addressed from the top down and bottom up.” Gymnastics fans also worried about the conflict between supporting the athletes and supporting a system that failed them. Jessica Taylor Price from Somerville, Mass., a freelance writer who contributes to thegymter.net regularly, said, “It’s terrible that the levels of dysfunction in the sport were so much worse than we thought, and I can’t help but feel complicit.” Vanessa from New York, a former tumbler and gymnastics fan who continues to take gymnastics classes as an adult, said: “Do I even continue to watch this sport, or do I show my anger in not supporting U.S.A.G.? But by not watching or supporting them, I’m taking away from the gymnasts who have worked quite literally their entire lives to be on a national stage.” Ms. Price wondered whether fans boycotting gymnastics meets like the national championships would send a message to U.S.A. Gymnastics. Another fan, Emily from California, said: “I can’t imagine watching U.S.A.G. meets, although I hate the idea of not supporting young gymnasts. Gymnastics used to be an escape for me from the harsh world of work, and stress, and politics. But now it’s all coalescing into a story about a world where women aren’t heard.”",7431
5a985412410cf7000162eb77,2018-03-01T19:27:06+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/sports/soccer/soccer-memory-west-brom.html,Sports,"WEST BROMWICH, England — Steve Griffiths first noticed something was wrong about four years ago. The clues were only little things — putting something down and not being able to remember where, forgetting longstanding appointments — but they were enough to make him worry. At first, he and his wife, Heather, wondered if it might be stress. Griffiths ran his own tire business, and that meant long days at work and hours at night worrying about the competition. They thought giving up work might improve his health, so Steve took early retirement. It made no difference. For a while, then, they wondered if perhaps he was experiencing the early stages of Parkinson’s disease. His hands shook a little when he talked; his movement was slightly stiff. Last July, though, he learned it was not Parkinson’s. Instead, Steve, 60 at the time, was told he had early-onset Alzheimer’s. There was a little relief in finally having a diagnosis, in “knowing what we were facing,” as Heather said, but mostly it was shock and fear. “It took awhile to come to terms with it,” she said. A few months on, Steve has “good days and bad days, times when I am a bit depressed, a bit down.” Losing his driver’s license, and the independence it bestowed, hit him hard. Mainly, though, it is the little things that hurt, dozens of them every day. Each one is another little blow delivered by his disease. Each one erodes his confidence a little more, eating away at his sense of self. Beneath the fog, though, Steve is who he has always been. The big things, including that composite of experience and memory and interests that defines a person, are still there. He has been a West Bromwich Albion fan since he was a child, and neither his condition nor the team’s recent struggles have changed that. He gave up his season ticket a few years ago; coping with the match day crowds at the Hawthorns was too much. But he still goes to the stadium, only now it is when the stands are quiet and the field is empty. Along with Heather, Steve has come every Wednesday for the last six weeks as part of a program, run for five years by West Brom’s foundation, called Albion Memories. Each group consists of a handful of West Brom fans, all of them suffering from some form of dementia, as well as some partners and caregivers. One or two wear West Brom scarves, gently draping them over their chairs, or knitted hats embroidered with the club’s crest. They come to meet and to talk — “to get out of the house,” as Heather put it. But mainly, they come to remember. “We want to energize their memories, to get them talking again,” said Paul Glover, the foundation’s head of disability. The best way to do that, he believes, is through soccer, through West Brom, tapping into the vast reservoir of memories built up through a lifetime of being a fan, its hold so strong that it remains untouched even as dementia starts to take a toll in other ways. “Their memory is often very good, even if they cannot recall what they had for dinner last night,” said Jan Liddell, a senior health care support worker at Edward Street mental health hospital. All of the members of the group are patients at Edward Street; all have expressed an interest in soccer, and all, as part of their treatment, have been offered the chance to join the Albion Memories program. “With memory, there is an element of use it or lose it,” Liddell said. They come here to use it. The format is simple. The participants sit in a semicircle in a stadium lounge, gazing through a picture window at the field — the view itself is an aide-mémoire, Liddell said — while John Homer, the head of West Brom’s supporters’ club and a walking encyclopedia of the Black Country, as this part of England is known, interviews a player. Some interview subjects are drawn from the current squad, though Glover says the former stars get the best reactions: not just because of West Brom’s current struggles, but because those are the names and the faces that the aging members of the group — Griffiths, now 61, is among the youngest — remember. A few weeks ago, the guests were Graham Lovett and Graham Williams, veterans of the West Brom team that won the 1968 F.A. Cup, and the club’s former striker Micky Fudge. All three, at Homer’s gentle insistence, cycled through their memories of their playing days, telling stories, cracking jokes, amiably mocking one another. When Lovett lost the thread on one anecdote, Williams suggested with a smile that perhaps he should be in the audience, not on the stage. Skillfully, Homer seizes on every little story to spark something in the group. He asks where the players used to drink, and asks those listening if they remember the pub, if they know where it is. He mentions cafes and ice cream parlors, some long since closed, and cars that have not been on the road for decades. At one point, he breaks into an impromptu chorus of “Wonderful Copenhagen,” from the 1952 musical film “Hans Christian Andersen.” A few of the guests take up the tune. They remember the lyrics perfectly. “The key is to go into their world, not drag them into yours,” Homer said. He brings along old newspaper clippings and weathered programs as prompts, each one passed around, and pored over, by the group. Some visitors join in more readily than others, but whenever Homer — or any of his guests — brings up a player, even a name long forgotten, the reaction is universal. As Lovett tells a story about playing against Johnny Haynes, a revered 1950s star for Fulham, there is a ripple of recognition, a murmur of approval. These sessions do not cure dementia. They cannot. Nonetheless, their effect can be profound. Some of that comes from the simple act of socializing, organizers said, since many of those living with dementia find themselves increasingly isolated. “The clinical impact of loneliness is massive,” said Tony Jameson Allen, co-founder of the Sporting Memories Foundation, an organization that uses similar reminiscence therapies to run more than 100 such programs in Britain. “People with dementia often see their social circles reduce significantly. Groups like these can be really powerful.” Increasingly, soccer is being used as their focal point. A number of teams — including Everton and Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Brom’s fierce local rival — run similar programs, and the National Football Museum in Manchester opens its doors for patients suffering with dementia, too. Liddell said that she has seen how effective it can be firsthand. “When they come here, they all talk and interact, and they see that they are not alone,” she said. “There is a definite benefit for their well-being.” Most of all, though, the pleasure and the purpose are in the acts of remembering, of being able to remember, of feeling like themselves again. “This disease strikes at the heart of identity,” said Jason Karlawish, a co-director of the Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “It can lead to a fractured sense of who you are. The logic of an activity like this is to kindle emotionally salient memories that tap back into that identity.” He noted that while there was no data proving such therapies had a curative effect, much the same could be said of medication. “These are substantive programs,” he said. Over the years, Glover has seen hundreds of people like Griffiths attend the sessions, but the experiences of one or two have stayed with him. “We had one woman who came to the group with her father,” he said. Under Homer’s guidance, the man started to talk about the games he had seen, the players he had watched, the highs and lows. He was no longer someone with dementia. He was what he always had been, what he still was: a West Brom fan. The visit was just as powerful for his daughter. “She said that when he was here, she did not see him as she knew him,” Glover said, but as something, someone else. “She said she saw him as his younger self.”",7930
5a97587f410cf7000162e8ce,2018-03-01T01:33:47+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/sports/baseball/clint-frazier-yankees-concussion.html,Sports,"TAMPA, Fla. — Clint Frazier discovered the supposed restorative powers of hydration on Wednesday. When he arrived at Steinbrenner Field, he felt foggy, his head throbbed and his appetite had disappeared — telltale symptoms of the concussion he had been diagnosed with after twice colliding with the wall in an exhibition game Saturday. Then, on the advice of Russell Wilson, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback who is in camp this week with the Yankees, Frazier began drinking water — and lots of it. Frazier guzzled six 12-ounce bottles over an hour or so Wednesday morning, and suddenly the symptoms diminished. His headache dissipated and his hunger returned. “I don’t know for sure,” Frazier said with a laugh, estimating that he had drank a gallon of water. “But it pumps oxygen to your brain a lot, so I feel alive right now. Maybe I was lacking water; I don’t know. Maybe I just feel good.” The handling of Frazier’s brain injury is another example of how despite a raised awareness of concussions — and detailed protocols for diagnosing them — the treatment of such injuries remains murky in sports, where there are many interests competing with a player’s welfare. Wilson himself has experience with the issue. During a game in December, he ducked in and out of a treatment tent in a matter of seconds  after he was sent there for a concussion evaluation. The Seahawks were hit with a $100,000 fine for evading the protocol. Wilson was also criticized in 2015 for suggesting that a brand of fortified water, in which he had invested, had helped to prevent a concussion during a playoff game. While baseball is not the contact sport that football is, the Yankees still are no strangers to head injuries. Catcher Austin Romine was sidelined with a concussion in 2013, as was infielder Stephen Drew in 2015. And last season, Jacoby Ellsbury missed a month with a concussion after crashing into the center-field wall at Yankee Stadium to make a catch. Ellsbury was allowed to remain in the game to finish the inning. Frazier’s first collision Saturday came when he made a leaping catch in the first inning before falling and hitting the back of his head on the outfield wall. But his injury may have been the result of a second, lesser collision he had with the wall several innings later. His head did not hit the wall, but his shoulder did, leaving Frazier to wonder if the second collision was jarring enough to exacerbate the first. Frazier was not evaluated on the field, but was checked out when he returned to the dugout at the end of the first inning. “I made it through the game and felt fine,” Frazier said. “That’s why it was frightening afterward. That’s why you have to take it seriously.” Still, Frazier admitted to feeling conflicted. He arrived to spring training determined to play his way onto the opening day roster, a tall task but one that is not out of reach for a former No. 4 overall draft pick. He can’t earn a spot unless he’s on the field. “It’s not fun watching your goal slipping away while you’re sitting on the shelf,” Frazier said. Scott Rodeo, the team doctor for the N.F.L.’s Giants, emphasized that concussions were a unique type of injury. He said he had seen jarring hits resulting in a near-loss of consciousness leave no signs of a concussion, while an innocuous collision could leave persistent symptoms. As for water helping out? “I don’t know of any physiological reason why drinking water would make a difference in alleviating symptoms of a concussion,” Rodeo said. Major League Baseball’s concussion protocol, instituted in 2011 and updated in the most recent collective bargaining agreement, was supposed to take decisions about handling concussions away from players and managers. It calls for the game to be stopped and a player to be evaluated by a certified athletic trainer if there is an incident with a “high risk of concussion.” Manager Aaron Boone said there was some thought to removing Frazier from the game at the end of the first inning, but tests did not show any symptoms. “I think we were comfortable with how we checked him out and checked in on him,” Boone said. “There wasn’t anything in the immediate right there to suggest getting him out of the game.” When the Yankees returned from Bradenton, Fla., after the game, Frazier’s head began to hurt and he began to feel nauseated. He notified a trainer, who put him through a battery of tests: balancing on each foot with his eyes closed, looking at lights, reciting the months backward, remembering five words they told him at the beginning. “I passed all that,” Frazier said. “It was just the headaches.” He did not feel any better on Sunday or Monday. When Frazier arrives at the clubhouse each day, he typically eats three scrambled eggs with cheese, three pancakes and hash browns. In recent days, he barely touched his food. When he went outside, the sunlight was blinding. Frazier said the first time he was told he had a concussion was on Monday, when he was sent by the Yankees to a doctor outside the organization. On Tuesday, Frazier rode an exercise bike for 11 minutes to build his heart rate up. He felt O.K., so he then went to the batting cage to take some swings in a soft-toss drill, but he became dizzy tracking the flight of the ball. When he arrived at Steinbrenner Field on Wednesday morning, he did not feel any better. He sat at his locker with his forehead throbbing, comparing it to a migraine. “I can’t even sit in my living room without feeling like” rubbish, Frazier said, using an expletive. “I can’t shake the headache all day.” But then he began to drink water. He felt well enough to ride the exercise bike again and take some more swings in the cage. He reported afterward that his head remained clear. The same could not be said for when he will be back on the field.",5818

A day after P.S.G. Coach Unai Emery denied reports that Neymar, a star for the Brazilian national team, would have an operation, the club walked back that statement on Wednesday and announced that he would have surgery. “After an initial treatment period of three days in line with a strict medical protocol, a joint decision has been taken between the medical staffs of both Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team,” P.S.G. said in a statement. P.S.G. broke soccer’s transfer record last year by paying Barcelona 222 million euros ($260 million) to buy Neymar, in part with the hope that he would lead the club to the Champions League title. But those hopes took a massive blow when he was injured on Sunday during P.S.G.’s 3-0 win over Marseille. Tests later revealed he had a cracked fifth metatarsal in his right foot along with an ankle injury. P.S.G., the runaway French league leaders, said that “in accordance with the player, it has been decided that Neymar Jr. will undergo surgery in Brazil at the end of this week. He will be operated on by Dr. Rodrigo Lasmar, accompanied by Professor Saillant, representing PSG.” Gerard Saillant has operated on high-profile athletes, including the former Brazil striker Ronaldo. After Emery said on Tuesday that Neymar had a chance to recover in time to play at the Parc des Princes against Madrid, the player’s father, Neymar Santos, had cast a doubt on whether his son would participate in the match, saying he believed Neymar would need surgery. There were concerns that Neymar could aggravate the injury and potentially threaten his chances of playing in the World Cup this summer if he continued playing for P.S.G. instead of having surgery. Metatarsal injuries are common in soccer and can sometimes lead to a lengthy absence. P.S.G., which beat Marseille by 3-0 in a French Cup match on Wednesday without their star striker, did not say how long Neymar would be sidelined, but his father estimated that the recovery would take “between six and eight weeks.”",2181

Mr. Blackmun was highly regarded and viewed as a stabilizing force in an organization previously troubled by chaotic leadership. But criticism of the committee’s handling of the abuse scandal involving the national team doctor for gymnastics had led two United States senators and a group of about 30 former Olympians, athletes’ representatives and child-advocacy experts to call for Mr. Blackmun to resign. Mr. Blackmun became chief executive in 2010, and in January disclosed that tests showed he had prostate cancer. The senators called for Mr. Blackmun to leave his post after The Wall Street Journal reported that the committee did not intervene despite learning in 2015 from U.S.A. Gymnastics that gymnasts were victims of possible sexual misconduct by Dr. Nassar, a year before accusations became public in an investigation by The Indianapolis Star. The committee has said it followed proper procedures and was told that the authorities were being contacted. But The New York Times in February identified at least 40 girls and women who said that Dr. Nassar molested them between July 2015, when he first fell under F.B.I. scrutiny, and September 2016, when he was exposed by The Star. In November, Dr. Nassar pleaded guilty to sexually abusing seven girls, but at his sentencing hearing in January in Michigan, more than 150 girls and women described sexual abuse by him for years while they were under his care, either with the United States gymnastics teams, at private gyms or through his job at Michigan State. He was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for multiple sex crimes. He had already been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison for child pornography convictions. In January, Mr. Blackmun called for the resignation of the entire board of U.S.A. Gymnastics in the wake of the Nassar scandal, and days later the members complied. The head of U.S.A. Gymnastics had resigned last March. U.S.A. Gymnastics, which sets the sport’s rules and policies and selects the American teams for the Olympics, has been widely derided for its handling of the sex-abuse scandal, but the U.S.O.C. has also come under scrutiny for its inability to hold the gymnastics federation accountable for its failures. In his email demanding the resignation of the entire U.S.A. Gymnastics board, Mr. Blackmun wrote that the gymnastics federation needed “a categorically fresh start at the board level,” adding that “reform must start with an entirely new board.” Mr. Blackmun did not attend the recent Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. But Larry Probst, the chairman of the Olympic committee’s board, said at a news conference before the Games that Mr. Blackmun would keep his job — for which he was paid $1 million in 2016 — until the organization had completed an independent investigation of its actions in the Nassar matter. In a phone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Probst attributed Mr. Blackmun’s resignation to his health, but the organization acknowledged the urgency of the scandal and outlined multiple reforms alongside the change in leadership. Those included increased funding for Dr. Nassar’s victims and a plan to re-examine the basic governance structure of American Olympic sports. Mr. Probst said Mr. Blackmun and the board agreed that the organization “needed a C.E.O. who can work 24-7 as we navigate through this situation.” Asked whether he felt it was appropriate for him to remain as chairman of the Olympic committee, Mr. Probst said, “I serve at the discretion of the board, so that is really a question for them to answer.” He added that he was confident that he and the current board members were “the appropriate group of people to lead the organization through these difficult times.” Susanne Lyons, a former executive at Visa who has belonged to the committee’s board since 2010, will serve as acting chief executive until a permanent replacement is found, the organization said. Ms. Lyons said she wanted the committee to re-evaluate its relationship with the national governing bodies of each sport and make sure it has “clear-cut authorization to intercede” when appropriate. “I understand that may involve opening up the Amateur Sports Act,” she said in a phone interview, referring to the four-decade-old legislation that puts the U.S.O.C. in charge of amateur sports in the United States but also limits its power to interfere with the business of national sports federations. Ms. Lyons said the process for finding a new chief executive had begun and would take four to six months. The leadership of the Olympic committee learned that gymnasts had been abused by a top doctor at U.S.A. Gymnastics during the summer of 2015 but largely stayed on the sidelines because, the Olympic officials have said, they were deferring to law enforcement. Mr. Blackmun and Mr. Probst asked few questions of the U.S.A. Gymnastics leadership. Only last year did the Olympic committee’s board recommend that U.S.A. Gymnastics remove its president, Steve Penny. Asked what lesson he could draw from the past two years, Mr. Probst said, “I don’t know that there is a particular lesson from the last two years.”",5308
5a9707f0410cf7000162e7e9,2018-02-28T19:50:04+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/sports/baseball/minnesota-twins-fernando-rodney.html,Sports,"FORT MYERS, Fla. — Fernando Rodney chose to play his home games in Minnesota this season. His younger self would never have believed it. Rodney is the oldest player on any 40-man roster this spring training. He signed his first professional contract in late 1997, for $3,000 with Detroit, and then left the Dominican Republic for spring training in Lakeland, Fla. After two years, he was assigned to a Class A team in Grand Rapids, Mich., where the average low temperature in April is 38 degrees. Rodney was miserable. “I said to him, ‘Hey, the cold’s mental, man,’ ” said Ramon Santiago, Rodney’s roommate then and a Tigers coach now. “He said: ‘Mental? It’s not mental, it’s cold!’ ” Rodney laughed about it here the other day, in the spring training clubhouse of his ninth major league team. “You come from the Dominican, you go to Florida — and then you go to West Michigan!” he said. “All those little towns around there were cold. But I think about it: ‘You have to stay here.’ I said, ‘O.K., I’m going to try.’ I started my career like that.” As Rodney approaches his 41st birthday, on March 18, his career is not slowing down. His fastball has held steady, at 94 to 95 miles an hour, more than 10 m.p.h. harder than his signature changeup. He converted 39 of 45 save chances last season, helping the Arizona Diamondbacks reach the playoffs, and he signed with the Twins for one year and $4.5 million. “He’s what we needed,” said LaTroy Hawkins, a special assistant to baseball operations for the Twins and one of their former pitchers. “If he can do what he’s done the last few years, it’ll be a lot of fun.” Hawkins was the majors’ oldest player when he retired in 2015, at 42. Bartolo Colon now holds that distinction, but Colon, 44, signed a minor league deal with Texas and is trying to make the Rangers’ staff. The Twins, who made a surprising appearance in the playoffs last year, are counting on Rodney. After struggling last April, Rodney had a 2.38 earned run average the rest of the way for the Diamondbacks. The Twins, who also added the veteran relievers Addison Reed and Zach Duke, join Detroit, the Angels, Tampa Bay, Seattle, the Cubs, San Diego, Miami and Arizona on Rodney’s career itinerary. “Sometimes you see the roster and you say, ‘Why am I here?’ ” Rodney said. “I say, ‘I don’t know, maybe I can control the game.’ ” Last season, Rodney became just the fifth pitcher to earn 30 saves after age 40, joining the Hall of Famers Dennis Eckersley and Trevor Hoffman, as well as Mariano Rivera and Doug Jones. Rodney has 300 saves in his career, and with four more, he will pass Jones and move into the top 25 on the career list. Rodney could never have imagined this future as a boy in Samaná, a mountainous beach town in the Dominican. He did not consider a future in the game until his late teens, when a friend signed a professional contract, and Rodney started pitching only about a year before he signed, at age 20. He started for a bit but preferred the bullpen, inventing his changeup when he tried to find a grip for a two-seam fastball. With Santiago, his teammate throughout the minors, Rodney brought some of Samaná to their diet, cooking fish regularly. His father, Ulise, was a fisherman who wore his hat sideways to block the sun. Rodney was pitching for Class AA Erie when his father died of cancer in April 2002. Just three days later, the Tigers promoted Rodney to the majors. He lost his debut — on an unearned run at the old Metrodome in Minneapolis — and soon decided to wear his hat askew, as his father had done. That tribute remains part of Rodney’s inimitable style, along with his bow-and-arrow celebration after closing out wins. Rodney devised that in 2012 with the Rays, gathering with teammates on the mound and pointing to an imaginary landing spot for the arrow. The archery theme aligns with a legend about Rodney’s hometown. As the story goes, natives of Samaná greeted Christopher Columbus with arrows after he arrived on their shores in 1493, inspiring the nickname Golfo de Las Flechas, or Bay of Arrows, for the area. But there was another reason for Rodney’s ritual. “I watch a lot of the Animal Channel, and you see the guy get the arrow and shoot,” he said. “When they shoot it in a good spot, they can run, but you know they’re going to be dead. So that’s how the idea got in my mind: When I shoot the arrow, the game is over.” The antics are charming and harmless, but in a game that often values conformity, Rodney’s showmanship stands out. He says he simply wants teammates to share in his joy. “When you show your teammates your love and passion for the game, that’s the only way you can express yourself, to try to be comfortable, to have fun everywhere,” Rodney said. “I want the guy behind me and in front of me to know I’m happy, I feel good, and I’m here for the same reason.” Derek Falvey, the Twins’ chief baseball officer, said he was struck by Rodney’s authenticity — “This guy cares very deeply about people,” Falvey said — and his physical condition. Rodney is listed at 5 feet 11 inches and 230 pounds, much of that weight in his legs, shoulders and upper back. “Look at his body, man,” said Hawkins, who is six inches taller than Rodney but weighs less. “He’s built like a tank. He’s not that tall guy like I was. He’s a cinder block.” Rodney, who had Tommy John surgery in 2004, said he stayed strong by working with a weighted ball in the winter, emphasizing shoulder exercises and eating healthily. While younger flamethrowers increasingly dominate bullpens in the steroid-testing era, Rodney has never been implicated in scandal. He has pitched in every major league city, closed out the 2013 World Baseball Classic and pitched in all four of Detroit’s losses in the forgettable 2006 World Series. He said he preferred the frenzied atmosphere of the W.B.C., during which teammates rallied around the lucky plantain Rodney brought to the dugout. “You want to be around Fernando Rodney because he’s going to be the same guy every single day,” said the Mets’ Jose Reyes, a Dominican teammate in the W.B.C. “Great attitude, big smile, he always has a joke — and he’s always going to do something weird.” Rodney likes to sneak up on teammates in the weight room and surprise them with voices: the deep, affected baritone of a broadcaster, a rooster’s, Kermit the Frog’s. He thrives on crowd noise and particularly favors Fenway Park’s bullpen because of its proximity to the fans. “When they’re close like that, I have more concentration on what I’m going to do because they yell a lot of things,” Rodney said. “You have to make sure you do your job because if you don’t do your job, the next day you come out, they say, ‘O.K., here he comes again!’ ” Some players have enjoyed seeing Rodney coming in. He considers Derek Jeter (5 for 10) and Justin Morneau (7 for 17) some of his toughest outs, but he has owned Ben Zobrist (0 for 12) and Alex Rodriguez (2 for 14). His favorite catcher was Jose Molina, who kept a statue-like frame while stealing strikes on the corners. After signing with the Twins, Rodney made plans to see the Super Bowl in Minneapolis. He does not follow football closely, but he wanted to see what the fuss was about. He flew in from the Dominican and wore a vintage Rob Gronkowski jersey, shooting imaginary arrows from his seat at U.S. Bank Stadium. Rodney would like to see more physical contact in baseball. He lamented recent rule changes aimed at curbing collisions on the bases. “In football, if you’re not ready, they’re going to hit you — that’s what they do, and that’s why the fans yell,” Rodney said. “That’s a special moment in football, and the fans want to see that. They want to see you break up the double play. I know at home plate sometimes it’s a little hard, but that’s what the fans want. They want to see the catcher hold the ball when you push him — ‘He keeps the ball! He’s out!’ ” Rodney’s enthusiasm has never waned. You hear it in his voice and see it in his actions. “One day I’m going to wake up in my bed and say, ‘Hey, I think that’s enough,’ ” Rodney said. “But I don’t feel that way right now.”",8136
5a96d9de410cf7000162e748,2018-02-28T16:33:28+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/sports/tennis/marion-bartoli.html,Sports,"The 2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli endured mental abuse and physical illness over the past two years that, she said, left her close to death. Dramatic weight loss fueled distressing speculation about her health and left little promise of a return to anything resembling professional tennis. Yet somehow Bartoli is back, partly because she fixed a far less sensational problem: her serve. A shoulder impingement and a torn tendon, most likely caused by her unorthodox service motion, forced Bartoli to retire just weeks after she won Wimbledon. Now Bartoli, 32, has a new, more conventional serve. “I don’t know if you can call it conventional,” Bartoli, who is French, said with a laugh. “I don’t know if I do anything conventional.” Indeed, in 14 years on the professional tennis tour, Bartoli was not known for conformity. In addition to that odd serve, she had a rare, two-handed forehand and relied on a series of unusual training methods that involved elastic ropes tied from torso to limbs. Her latest unconventional move is a comeback to the tour after four and a half years of a retirement that was at times agonizing and frightening. Her return will begin at the Tie Break Tens, a one-day exhibition tournament on Monday at Madison Square Garden, where she will join Serena Williams, Venus Williams and five other players. Bartoli also hopes to play at the Miami Open later in March, then a tournament in Monterrey, Mexico, and perhaps a dozen or so more this year, including the three remaining Grand Slam events. She is not the first former Grand Slam champion to attempt a comeback. Kim Clijsters made a triumphal return after a nearly two-year layoff, winning the United States Open in 2009. Justine Henin made a brief comeback after a 20-month absence. But Bartoli’s recent retirement lasted much longer and included harrowing months of poor health. “I’ve been weighing, at some point, 90 pounds, and I was close to dying,” she said in a recent telephone interview from Paris. “So anything that comes after that is a bonus. If I am able to call myself a professional tennis player after that, it’s a huge victory.” During her best years Bartoli was consistently in the top 10, ascending as high as No. 7. She was a powerful player who dictated points with an aggressive style that mitigated her relative lack of court coverage. It was a successful formula, but eventually her right shoulder became so inflamed that she could not play more than 45 minutes without searing pain, she said. Five weeks after her greatest triumph at Wimbledon (she was also a runner-up there in 2007), she stepped aside. But what followed in retirement was much worse than any shoulder pain. Bartoli described an 18-month period in which a boyfriend tormented her into dropping unhealthy amounts of weight, beginning in the autumn of 2015. According to Bartoli, the man, whom she did not name, harped on her weight and pressured her into a diet that she knew was unhealthy. He would point to slim women and mention how they looked better than Bartoli. She said her weight plummeted to 114 pounds from 165. “But I did it because he was just, every single day, telling me I was too heavy and too fat and whatever and whatever,” she said. “So I started a diet that just never ends, basically.” Perhaps weakened from that ordeal, Bartoli said, she contracted a virus from a mosquito while traveling in India: a version of the H1N1, also known as swine flu. She said she had a fever of 104 degrees for 15 straight days and lost even more weight, dropping to 90 pounds. During those months she worked as a television broadcaster at tennis events, and conducted on-court interviews at the French Open in Paris. People were so taken aback by her weight loss that some speculated she had anorexia, which Bartoli said bothered her because it was untrue. The turning point came in 2016 at Wimbledon, where Bartoli hoped to play in an exhibition doubles event. But tournament doctors, fearing for her health, refused to allow her to play. It was then that Bartoli revealed she had contracted the virus and said she would soon be entering a clinic. “Looking back, I think they took the best decision for me because I would have probably died on that court if I played a tennis match on that weight,” she said. “It took me a very long period of time to recover, definitely. I went into the hospital for four months after that.” As she gradually recovered, Bartoli started to consider playing tennis again. Last October, she assembled a team and began to train. But during her illness she had lost significant muscle mass and virtually all athletic conditioning. Bartoli pounded weights and spent two weeks training at 9,800 feet in the French Alps, which she said was exhausting but critical to her revival. Her stamina and muscle structure have largely returned, she said, and although she is still not fully fit, she has gotten close enough to play. Training has shifted back to Paris, where she has played regularly against Ugo Humbert, a 19-year-old Frenchman ranked No. 331 on the ATP Tour. She also reported feeling no pain in her shoulder. Bartoli spent the last few months learning new mechanics with her serve, which was the real beginning for her comeback. In her old service motion, her right arm remained stiff as she brought it around to strike the ball, mostly without bending her elbow. Now, she said, she has learned to bend the elbow in a way to take pressure off her shoulder. The velocity is steadily increasing, but it remains a challenge. “It’s not easy to learn something new at 32 years of age,” she said. When Bartoli returns — either at Madison Square Garden or another tournament — at least one thing will look the same: the two-handed forehand that has defined her game. “That hasn’t changed,” she said, “and I don’t think it will ever change.”",5857

Putin said the decision by the International Olympic Committee on Wednesday to lift its suspension of Russia signaled that it was time for the country to put the doping scandal behind it, a sentiment echoed by some of its newly minted Olympic winners. “We have to turn this page,” Mr. Putin said at a warm, relaxed ceremony in one of the Kremlin’s gilded, domed reception halls, where he awarded state medals to the Russian athletes who won medals at the recent Pyeongchang Games in South Korea. Russia has long blamed the scandal on an international effort to isolate the country, rather than revelations about its state-backed doping program, which soiled a series of international sporting events. The return of Russia to full-member status in the International Olympic Committee was not connected to any acknowledgment of wrongdoing, and Mr. Putin stuck to the Kremlin’s standard line. “I hope that international organizations will eventually understand that sports should be kept as far away as possible from problems that are completely unrelated to sports,” he said. “In general, with all the complexities and problems, the Games gave us pleasant surprises and new heroes.” The 44 or so Olympians being honored — first with medals, then with a Champagne toast and finally with a new BMW each — had the option of saying a few words from the podium. The few who spoke welcomed the end of the Olympic penalties, but they too expressed a certain defiance that the Russian Olympic team, and by extension the country, had emerged from the Winter Olympics relatively well despite the hurdles involved. Pavel Datsyuk, a former N.H.L. player for the Detroit Red Wings and the captain of the Russian team that won gold in men’s ice hockey, called it a “landmark Olympics” for his country. “We did a decent job defending the honor of our country,” he said in thanking the president, attributing the outcome to both the Russian character and support from across this vast land. “Thanks for your help, thanks for letting us vindicate to the whole world that our Russian character is not broken and won’t ever be broken.” Russia’s flag and anthem were missing from the Pyeongchang Games, though more than 160 of the nation’s athletes were able to participate as neutrals called “Olympic Athletes From Russia.” Two of them accounted for half of the failed drug tests at the Pyeongchang Games. Russia was not allowed to march under its flag in the closing ceremony. Russia’s reinstatement followed a decision on Sunday by the I.O.C.’s executive board, led by Thomas Bach, its president, to bring Russia back into the fold if the remaining drug tests of its athletes from the Pyeongchang Games were confirmed as negative. Scores of Russian athletes, coaches and officials were barred after an investigation into the yearslong conspiracy that peaked at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, when the state security apparatus colluded with sports officials to swap drug-tainted urine samples with clean ones in a clandestine, dead-of-night operation. The scandal and its aftermath have led to much upheaval in the global sporting movement, with many athletes and some of the I.O.C.’s own members critical of the way it had been dealt with. Richard Pound, the organization’s longest serving member, boycotted the closing of the Pyeongchang Games in protest. The doping scheme has now tarnished no fewer than three Olympic Games. At Sunday’s I.O.C. session, where the plan to rehabilitate Russia was first announced, Nicole Hoevertsz, an official from Aruba tasked with monitoring Russian compliance, said the time had come to move on. “We should draw a line, we have to draw a line and look to the future,” she said. After the two failed drug tests by Russian athletes — by the curler Alexander Krushelnytsky and the bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva — the I.O.C. did not lift the suspension for the closing ceremony, which it had called a possibility. At the Kremlin, various Russian medalists said that being able to participate in the Olympics was more important than being able to display their national symbols, and several thanked Mr. Putin for allowing them to compete despite the restrictions. Ilya Kovalchuk, a star in both the American and Russian hockey leagues, said in an interview that the most important factor was fulfilling his dream of winning an Olympic gold medal; the other circumstances proved secondary. “It was a little different, but we tried not to think about it too much,” he said. Perhaps the most emotional moment, he said, was when the Russian hockey players began singing their own national anthem instead of the Olympic hymn being played as they were awarded their gold medals. “Everyone knows where we are from,” he said. “Ninety percent of the fans were cheering for us, and there were a lot of Russian flags in the stands. Our friends and families were there, singing, our kids, it was great.” The athletes seemed to consider their “Olympic Athlete From Russia” uniforms something of a historical treasure to be preserved, not a mark of Cain to be discarded. “Athletes from other countries were coming up to us and saying, ‘Olympic Athlete From Russia,’ it sounds very honorable, really good; they wanted a name like that,” said Ekaterina Bobrova, a silver medalist in ice dancing. The winners generally attributed the far lower Russian medal count — with 17 over all, compared with 29 at Sochi, after some were later rescinded for doping — to the fact that much of the squad was not there. But Ms. Bobrova said you could also look at it from the point of view that the Russians did really well winning 17 medals with so many athletes barred. That was also a common sentiment at the podium during the ceremony with Mr. Putin, which was held in the round St. Catherine’s Hall, decorated in shades of blue and gold. After a winner’s name was announced, he or she was serenaded to the front of the room by an orchestra of about 30 musicians. All the hockey players walked forward to a blast of brass instruments playing an old Soviet hockey tune, “No Coward Plays Hockey.” “Cross-country skiing was hit especially hard,” said Yulia Belorukova, who clanked forward wearing her two bronze medals in the sport. “We had lots of young people on board, but we proved that Russia is clean and that we’re capable of competing for medals in any situation.” Russia has never accepted the description of a state-controlled doping operation in the country set out in great detail by its former doping laboratory head, Grigory Rodchenkov, and confirmed by three separate investigations. The World Anti-Doping Agency said it would continue to regard Russia’s domestic drug testing organization as noncompliant until it does. Many of Russia’s top athletes were barred from the 2018 Games because of links to the doping scandal. That led to a weak performance, and a vast downgrade from the doping-fueled success in Sochi, where Russia topped the medals table. Alina Zagitova, a 15-year-old figure skater, beat her compatriot Evgenia Medvedeva in a battle for gold, before the Russians secured the hockey title in an overtime victory over Germany on the final day. As well as the Olympic ban, Russia was forced to pay a $15 million fine. The effects of the scandal continue to roil the sports world. Several biathletes, including members of the United States team, have announced that they will not participate in next month’s season-ending competition in Russia, while soccer’s governing body, FIFA, is facing scrutiny just four months before the World Cup in Russia over claims of doping by players from there.",7640

He is drilling a quartet of Golden State Warriors, each young enough to be his grandson. At 5 feet 11 inches, Ron Adams is in a land of giants. Methodically, he orders centers and forwards, most of them nearly a foot taller, through defensive maneuvers and a shooting workout. His boss, Steve Kerr, eyes him intently, then smiles like a gambler admiring someone who is beating the odds. “I could watch him run drills all day,” Kerr says. “Seventy years old and still at it!” Adams was in his mid-60s when Kerr, the Warriors’ head coach, hired him away from the Boston Celtics, where he was the lead assistant coach. What Kerr wanted was a venerable wise man, someone who had coached for decades but had no real desire to be promoted. Someone who would thus be free to speak his mind — like Tex Winter, who was Phil Jackson’s assistant in the 1990s when Kerr starred on the Chicago Bulls’ championship-winning teams. In the summer of 2014, Kerr took Adams to dinner at A16, a trendy, red-brick restaurant in Oakland. Adams, who reads literature and poetry and likes fine wine, ordered a bottle of pinot noir for the table. The waiter poured a bit for him to try. He swirled it in his glass and took a sip. “That tastes nothing like a pinot,” he said, insisting the waiter bring another bottle. “He sent the wine back!” Kerr recalls. He chuckles at the memory. “Ron is the first and only guy I have ever seen who sent the wine back!” “I’m thinking,” he adds, with an expletive for emphasis, “‘Who is this guy?’ “I wanted a truth-teller, somebody to tell me, ‘You gotta do this, and you gotta do that,’ completely unfiltered,” Kerr says. “Somebody whose experience and wisdom made everyone stand up and listen. I knew right then that we were talking to the right guy, and I’m just thankful we have him because he’s been instrumental in all that we’ve done. “Ron Adams, he’s our Tex.” For a sports franchise, the Warriors are uncommonly engaged with the outside world, particularly when it comes to politics and social activism. Kerr and several of his players — superstars keenly sensitive to the hardships faced by black people — have been sharply critical of President Trump. They have taken public stances against police shootings, inequities in the justice system and the rise in racist rhetoric. In December, the Warriors blared “Sweet Home Alabama” over the loudspeakers on their practice court the morning after Doug Jones, a Democrat, upset Roy Moore, a Republican who had been accused of sexual assault, in Alabama’s Senate race. Adams, a renaissance man in professional basketball, plays a subtle role in this activism. He goads an already intellectually curious team to keep learning, keep reading, keep searching for more. Adams is the exacting, behind-the-scenes coach known for sending out links to essays about Trump and race. He is the one eager to talk big ideas: philosophy, religion, sociology and especially politics. He is the one concerned about the pitfalls posed by big tech. He is the one who is best friends with a Gestalt psychologist. “Maybe that’s the key to longevity,” says a fellow assistant coach, Bruce Fraser, 53. “This business can engulf you, especially for us younger guys, and it gets worse as the season moves on. Here’s the guy who has lasted, and he makes sure to always remind us that there is more to the world.” Adams’s fascination with the world started early. His parents had a 320-acre farm in tiny Laton, on the plains of central California, 22 miles southeast of Fresno. The family raised cattle and grew alfalfa, corn and cotton. Adams was in charge of feeding the cows bushels of cured, baled alfalfa, which were wrapped in wire mesh and required clipping. He learned to do it with care and close attention to detail. A cow could die from ingesting even a sliver of wire. He learned something else. “On the farm, your rapport with your neighbor is critical,” Adams says. “There is a premium on honesty. You don’t fool people in that world.” On the farm he learned to speak the truth — and to send the wine back. “My father, I remember him getting bales of hay,” he says, “and if it didn’t meet his standard, the response would be polite but firm: ‘This is good but not what I wanted.’” Basketball was how he left the farm. He played guard in college at what is now Fresno Pacific University, where he became an assistant coach after graduation. It was 1969. He was 21. Adams never played again. He is not the oldest coach in the N.B.A. Bob Weiss, an assistant with the Denver Nuggets, is five years older, but Weiss played professional basketball for a dozen years. Adams kept coaching. In his mid-20s, he was promoted to head coach at his alma mater. By his mid-30s, he had honed a sophisticated defensive theory based in part on the tactics of a handful of coaches from the 1950s and 1960s. Adams put the theory into a booklet, “A Man-to-Man Pressure Defensive System,” and he developed a following. In his late 30s, he became the head coach at Fresno State. He was an unusual blend: professorial, bookish and hard-charging. “Bobby Knight-ish in some ways,” says Jervis Cole, one of his key players, drawing a comparison more with Knight’s authoritarian style than his histrionics. “Coach Adams cared about us in a way that was special.” But he was also demanding and structured to an extreme. One of his most talented forwards struggled under the dictates, transferred to Colorado State and became player of the year in the rival Western Athletic Conference. “It was, ‘My way or the highway,’” Cole says of Adams’s philosophy. “That is the way things were done in that era,” Adams says, ruefully. “Top-down. The chain of command was everything. The coach was very much in charge. When I look back, knowing what I know now, as a more experienced human being, I say to myself, ‘You sure could have taken a lot different approach.’” At the same time, his reputation for teaching the game kept soaring. He grounded his players in the same minutiae he now preaches to the Warriors: angles, foot positions, how to spread their hands, how to be an instigator instead of lying in wait, how to be flexible enough as a unit to protect multiple positions. Fresno State defended well, but it was short of talent. The Bulldogs won 43 games and lost 72. Adams resigned. “A very tough time for me,” he says. “Coaching the team in the area where you grew up, and you have parents and friends and family there, and it doesn’t go as well as you want it to go … .” His voice, ordinarily steady, trails off. He would never be a head coach again. It was 1990, the year Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were born and Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant turned 2. Career assistants don’t make enough money to retire early. Soon Adams began teaching his principles of defense to Jerry Tarkanian’s teams at U.N.L.V. Then he was in Iowa, at Drake. When Tarkanian took over the San Antonio Spurs, Adams joined him. When Tarkanian got fired, the new coach, John Lucas, kept Adams on. When Lucas bolted for Philadelphia, Adams went along. The N.B.A. grind, constant change with little job security, became part of life for Adams, his wife, Leah, and their two children. Says Leah: “I became an absolute expert at packing up and moving.” Still, doubt tore at Adams, not about his defensive tactics, but about coaching itself. About every four or five months, he says, he had “an existential crisis about what I should be doing.” “We all think we should be doing more than what we are, but the restrictiveness of what I do, and have done for almost 50 years, has been limiting,” he says. “In some ways, it has kept me from pursuits that I think are the most important.” He could imagine himself, for instance, in national politics. “There are a lot of needs out there,” he says. “So much crap is going on in our country, it’s worrisome. Our country is taking steps backward.” What of Curry, Durant, Green and all the other Warriors who are growing more and more comfortable with speaking out? “All of that makes me much prouder than anything they have ever done on the court,” he says. “We have players speaking truth to power. They should, because they see the world they come from in much more depth than someone who does not come from their background.” As Adams moved from team to team, whenever he worried about whether he was doing enough to change the world, he beat back the angst. His love of the game and the people who play it and coach it — their strategies and tactics and vibrant energy — kept him in thrall. “Whether you were a superstar like Ray Allen or a journeyman like me, he invested his life into you,” says Kevin Ollie, who played on a pair of Adams’s N.B.A. teams and is now a title-holding coach at the University of Connecticut. “He made you see what you could become.” Ollie has another recollection: The Adams of yesteryear went about his work with such driving earnestness that Ollie rarely saw him smile. The years folded one into the other, and on Adams went: Milwaukee, Chicago, Oklahoma City, back to Chicago, and finally to Boston, where he and Brad Stevens, head coach of the Celtics, took over a dismal young team. To this day, Stevens credits Adams, whom he calls “my editor,” with helping him establish the habits and expectations that have come to characterize the Celtics, now one of the best teams in the league. It looked like Boston would be his last stop. But then Kerr took Adams to dinner at A16. Over pizza, Kerr spoke of creating a dynamic Warrior offense that was forceful, fluid and fast. He also spoke of embracing Adams’s tenets so that he could establish a team defense with the same characteristics. No team in league history had played in that style on both ends of the court and won a title. At least, not yet. And Kerr had another bold idea, too. He wanted to change the Warrior culture. He would blend old school tenacity with outright fun. Adams was interested. On June 23, 2014, he joined the team. And at first, he was wary. Old school ran deep in his veins, and Kerr was creating a culture unlike any Adams had seen. He remembers his first Warrior practices. The team was jovial and loose. Hip-hop was ripping through a sound system. “I had to learn to put up with their crap music,” he says, a glint in his eye and sarcasm in his voice. “I’m an older coach,” Adams adds, “and I had to change.” It was difficult. Kerr wanted the team to learn from its losses — but not to wallow in them. Adams, however, “took losses really hard,” Kerr says. During Adams’s first season with the Warriors, the Memphis Grizzlies broke a 16-game Golden State winning streak. In the locker room afterward, Adams’s fellow coaches did their best to take the edge off. They reviewed what had gone wrong, but they laughed, jibed one another and reveled in how long they had been winning. Adams wanted nothing to do with such lightness. He sat apart from them, pored over game statistics and obsessed about the team’s blunders. “He was despondent, and he didn’t want to talk to anyone,” Kerr says. “I don’t like that. I want everyone to be able to commiserate and talk ourselves off the ledge, and Ron was not even looking at us. He was just in the corner, staring at his notebook.” It took time to adjust, but as the Warriors continued their steady walk to their first N.B.A. championship in 40 years, Adams approached Kerr. “I have an admission,” Kerr remembers him saying. “I didn’t know if what you were doing would work. I didn’t know if playing music and being loose and carefree could cut it. But what you’ve got going, it’s working, all right. You’ve cooked up an interesting stew.” Players and the other assistants noticed how Adams was evolving. Today, on a supremely tight-knit team, he’s like a revered grandfather: wise and beloved, confident enough to let himself be ribbed for his age, still stern and sharp enough to command respect and set a high bar. Kerr has discovered that Adams’s truth-telling doesn’t show itself in dramatic confrontation but in the steady grind of the day to day. Even during a winning streak, “Ron will tell me, ‘We stunk last night,’” Kerr says. “He will say it to my face. He does not get fooled by our record. He’ll walk into practice and tell me we have to do a certain defensive drill, we can’t forget the fundamentals, because we’ve been awful.’” Durant, Curry and Thompson laud Adams for holding them accountable. “‘You could have contested that shot. … You could have made that guy miss. … You’ve got to use that length of yours . … Verticality! Verticality!’” Durant says, mimicking the way Adams bends his ear. Green, unsurprisingly, is a bit different. “Draymond yells at me,” Adams says, “but I like that. I like healthy exchanges when people believe what they are trying to get across. I love him. He’s just totally unique, and I love that.” Although Adams has mellowed, he still gets animated. An opponent will catch the Warriors unaware, run through the lane and get an easy dunk. Adams, in his customary seat on the bench next to Kerr, will look as though he has just seen a traffic accident. He will lean back in his chair and fix his eyes on the rafters as if to say, “Good God, what in the hell is happening!” His contortions sometimes get spliced into the game videos shown at practice. The Warriors laugh. These days, Adams laughs with them. But losing still hurts. In a mid-January home game against the Los Angeles Clippers, Lou Williams, probably the best sixth man in the league, torched Golden State for a career high 50 points. Adams smoldered. At the buzzer, he walked straight off the court. When he emerged from the locker room, he was stern, tight-lipped, angry. In the parking lot, he stepped into his black Volkswagen sedan and gripped the wheel. “Throughout his barrage,” he fumed, “we just treated Lou Williams like another guy! Another guy!” He looked across the front seat. “Nights like this one are hard on me.” So is age. The N.B.A. season is a marathon: nine months and about 100 games for a championship team. To run it, Adams avoids overeating and cuts back on late-night wine. He stretches as often as he can. He gets away from basketball by playing tennis. His thumbs, stiffened by time and the rigors of basketball, sometimes hurt so badly that he has trouble cleaning his glasses. A chiropractor helps him with a neck condition that has curved his spine. Getting enough sleep is impossible. When the Warriors play night games, they sometimes climb on a plane that takes off at 2 a.m. and lands just before dawn. “You can wake up in a hotel room and not know where the hell you are,” Adams says. “It gets worse as you get older. Sometimes we’ll be on a flight taking off, and the impulse is, ‘What city were we just in?’ It’s crazy.” Golden State, he says, is his last stop. For now, though, Adams is in what he calls “basketball nirvana.” He is the defensive coordinator for a well-oiled troupe that has won two world titles on his watch and is the heavy favorite to take a third. League general managers have voted him the best N.B.A. assistant for three years running. There have been times this season when he has laughed and joked with his team more than he can ever recall doing in the past. And though in professional basketball he has never been a head coach, he says, “it probably worked out the way it should.” “I try to be an artisan,” he adds. “There is a purity to teaching as an assistant — a virtue in being a craftsman and having a craft. It’s the nuts-and-bolts stuff that appeals to me, and the relationships. “Plus, quite frankly, I don’t think, until the last five or six years of my life, I have exhibited the flexibility to be a head coach. The level where I’ve found myself is just perfect.” His life is a fine one by almost every measure. For home games, he puts in 14-hour days. But when he leaves the stadium at about 11 p.m., he drives only 15 minutes to his four-story house in Oakland. He grabs a bowl of corn chips and tucks himself into his office to dissect replays — and chill. It is a narrow room lined with African art, photos of the Warriors and a trove of books. There are poems by Thomas Lux, a memoir by Ta-Nehisi Coates. On one shelf, “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life” perches next to “The Power of Kindness.”",16573
5a95fc21410cf7000162e525,2018-02-28T00:47:23+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/sports/baseball/free-agent-scrimmage-camp-jobless.html,Sports,"BRADENTON, Fla. — Tyler Clippard is the first to admit he wasn’t very good last year, when the Yankees ditched him and the Houston Astros left him off their playoff roster. Still, Clippard, the guileful, spectacled reliever, had a hard time believing where he was on Tuesday morning — taking the mound for a team of unemployed free agents in a scrimmage against an industrial-league team from Japan. “This wasn’t even in the realm of my thought or possibility,” said Clippard, a two-time All-Star who turned 33 this month. “That’s what makes it so frustrating — it doesn’t seem to be warranted in any way. I’ve had one bad season in nine big league seasons. I didn’t think I’d be in this situation, absolutely not.” At the end of a winter in which the free-agent market has shriveled for pricey stars and journeyman veterans alike — pitcher Jake Arrieta and third baseman Mike Moustakas, who could reshape a rotation or a lineup, remain unsigned — there is palpable frustration at the so-called Camp Jobless, the baseball complex at the IMG Academy here where about 30 players have gathered for the last two weeks to train while waiting for a call. There was coming and going on Tuesday: Mike Napoli left after signing a minor-league contract with the Cleveland Indians, and Neil Walker arrived after his hopes of joining the Yankees evaporated last week when they traded for a younger, cheaper player in Brandon Drury. There was also some long-awaited pushback, as the players’ union filed a grievance with Major League Baseball against four teams — the Miami Marlins, the Tampa Bay Rays, the Oakland Athletics and the Pittsburgh Pirates — charging that the clubs are not spending their revenue-sharing money on improving the on-field product, as they are required to do. The Marlins, Rays and Pirates traded away their franchise players this winter — Giancarlo Stanton, Evan Longoria and Andrew McCutchen, respectively. Those three teams issued statements disputing the charges, which were first reported by the Tampa Bay Times. Pirates President Frank Coonelly dismissed the grievance as “frivolous.” The union’s executive director, Tony Clark, who watched Tuesday’s five-inning scrimmage, confirmed that the union had filed the grievance but declined to comment on it. But earlier, while speaking to a handful of reporters, Clark said this was not a case of a select few teams doing a tear-down — a strategy the Astros and Chicago Cubs employed on their way to winning the last two World Series. Clark said at least 10 of baseball’s 30 teams were not trying to win in the coming season, suppressing the free-agent market. If the Marlins, for example, had not put Stanton on the trading block, the Yankees most likely would have dipped into the free-agent market for more offense, even though they have a mandate from the owner Hal Steinbrenner to stay below the $197 million luxury tax threshold. Nearly one-third of the 166 players who became free agents after last season remain unsigned, and Clark said that 17 teams were at least $50 million below the luxury tax threshold. Clark was asked if, given hindsight, he had seen any of this coming while negotiating the collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified in December 2016 and runs through the 2021 season. “For me,” Clark said, “if we had known that there was going to be upwards of a third of the league that may not be as interested in being the last team standing and therefore wouldn’t value experience on some level, then I would say yes.” He added: “But that was never the assumption. The entire C.B.A. is grounded and fundamentally focused in on creating as many opportunities for all 30 teams as possible. I don’t know how many years you heard competitive balance, competitive balance, competitive balance.” In the last two labor agreements, teams have won the right to cap how much they spend on the draft and on most international signings, essentially allowing them to peg the cost of a rebuild. “Against the backdrop of not competing, yeah, that can be a huge issue,” Clark said. An increasing reliance on analytics has also reshaped how teams value players and construct their rosters, placing a premium on younger and cheaper players. But Clark and others at Camp Jobless, including catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Tom Gordon, the former pitcher who is coaching here, said that the qualities a veteran could provide — leadership and grooming — were not being accurately accounted for. That has led to a great deal of frustration among free agents still looking for work. “They start to lose hope, and it’s humiliating,” said Dave Gallagher, a former outfielder who is serving as a coach at the camp. To that end, the camp, which had been closed to the news media and accessible only by appointment for scouts, opened its doors on Tuesday. A little before 9 a.m., the players took the field in gray pants, black jerseys with a players’ association patch on the chest, and plain black caps. They played catch to warm up, took batting practice and prepared for a game — much the same way teams have at 30 sites around Florida and Arizona during spring training. About six scouts showed up to watch, their iPads and radar guns at the ready behind home plate. Familiar names like Luke Scott, Omar Infante, Chris Johnson and Nolan Reimold took their swings, and Clippard, Tom Gorzelanny and Jim Henderson pitched against Japan Railway East, whose coach, Horii Tetsuya, said his players were below Class AAA level. When the teams scrimmage again, on Thursday, Walker could be playing with them. A week ago, Walker — who last season played for the Mets and then the Milwaukee Brewers on a one-year, $17.2 million deal — thought he would end up with the Yankees as their second or third baseman. Then the Yankees acquired Drury, who will make the major league minimum this season. “Maybe it’s something that’s being lost in translation with teams — how are we valuing guys?” Walker said. “Are we strictly valuing them on numbers, or are we not able to quantify how they’re making an impact, not only on the field but in the clubhouse? I’ve always felt like I’ve been somebody that’s been a leader. I guess in terms of dollars and cents, teams are not seeing that as a value at this point.” Clippard, who made $6.15 million last season, said he had only received offers for a minor league contract so far, which he has rebuffed. He chafed at what he sees as a double standard. “As players, if we took a year off, we’d be out of the game,” Clippard said. “But it’s O.K. for owners and organizations to take years off, and it’s actually accepted.”",6620

The N.F.L. and the pizza company said they were mutually dissolving their national sponsorship deal, and that Papa John’s would focus instead on the smaller sponsorships it has with 22 of the league’s 32 teams. John Schnatter, the founder of the home-delivery pizza chain and the longtime face of the company, stepped down as chief executive at the start of this year. Schnatter said on an analyst call at the beginning of November that the N.F.L. should have stopped the protests in 2016, when they began. “The N.F.L. has been a long and valued partner over the years,” he said. “But we’re certainly disappointed that the N.F.L. and its leadership did not resolve the ongoing situation to the satisfaction of all parties long ago.

5a95bea8410cf7000162e475,2018-02-27T20:25:05+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/sports/ncaabasketball/big-ten-tournament.html,Sports,"When Coach John Beilein led Richmond to the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament in 1998, he had so much time to fill between the Colonial Athletic Association Tournament and Selection Sunday that he took his players fishing. Such is life for midmajor programs, which sometimes punch their tickets to the N.C.A.A. tournament a week — or more — before the major conferences have even gathered to crown their league champions. In that waiting period, keeping a team sharp can require coaching methods that have nothing to do with basketball. So there are fishing trips. And whiffle ball games. And intrasquad scrimmages. “Just anything to change things up,” Beilein said this week. Beilein coaches Michigan now, in the undeniably major Big Ten Conference. But the league will hold its tournament a week early this year, squeezing into the schedule for Madison Square Garden, which the Big East had already booked for the prime week. With Rutgers and Maryland now in the traditionally Midwestern Big Ten, the conference’s commissioner, Jim Delany, pressed for the schedule shift to give the league a chance to promote itself in the New York market. The reality of the move for Beilein, and several other coaches, is the prospect of having to review a midmajor coaching manual. If Michigan (24-7) qualifies for the N.C.A.A. tournament — ESPN currently projects the 15th-ranked Wolverines as a No. 6 seed — it and the rest of the Big Ten qualifiers will face at least a week off before learning the identity of their opponents in the tournament. The Big Ten tournament opens Wednesday evening at the Garden. Michigan will play its first game Thursday, and the top seeds — Michigan State, Ohio State, Purdue and Nebraska — on Friday. The championship game is Sunday afternoon, and then — welcome or not — the Big Ten’s scheduled break will begin. Depending on when they lose in New York, the N.C.A.A.-bound Big Ten teams could face a break of as much as two weeks going into their biggest games of the year. Beilein said he would probably fill the time with high-intensity scrimmages. Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo said he would prefer some sunshine. “We’re thinking of going to the Bahamas for the week to have a little spring break,” he joked. Like most coaches, Izzo is a creature of habit, and he wasn’t initially supportive of having the tournament a week early. Like Beilein, he said he understood the thinking behind the move, but with the off-week looming, he became less sure it was the right call. So did the Big Ten office. In an interview with The Chicago Tribune last week, Delany, the commissioner, acknowledged the schedule change “wasn’t good, wasn’t healthy,” and he issued what amounted to a public apology. “We won’t do it again this way,” Delany said, “and I take responsibility for asking the coaches.” (Next year, the Big Ten tournament will be at the United Center in Chicago, following its typical timetable.) The compromises in the conference schedule predated this week. To accommodate the tournament’s early start, the Big Ten played a compressed regular-season schedule, with several conference games taking place in early December and the bulk of the schedule starting in early January. That forced some teams to play tough games before they were ready, Izzo said, even as the change baked in a week of rest and recuperation before the N.C.A.A. tournament for the lucky ones who will be going. The rest could prove helpful, especially for teams with injured players, or those looking to work out problems in practice. Of course, if all — or even most — of the Big Ten’s teams lose in the first weekend of the N.C.A.A. tournament, the coaches and their teams’ fans will almost certainly blame the break. “Coaches are no different than anybody else,” Izzo said. “If we have some success, or Michigan or Purdue or Indiana or Ohio State, if anybody has some success in the N.C.A.A. Tournament, the week’s going to be good. “If you fail, the week’s going to be bad.” As for whether he will again take his team fishing, Beilein conceded that was unlikely. “That was in Richmond,” he said. “We’d have to do ice fishing here still for a couple more weeks.”",4171
5a958fef410cf7000162e3f2,2018-02-27T17:05:46+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/sports/baseball/baltimore-orioles-tim-beckham-.html,Sports,"SARASOTA, Fla. — Tim Beckham never quite got what he wanted. His favorite number in high school was 3, but then he signed with the Tampa Bay Rays. Evan Longoria wore 3, so Beckham decided he should try something else. He switched to 22 in the minors, but when he reached the majors, that number belonged to Chris Archer. The Rays assigned Beckham 29. He didn’t like that, either. Three years ago, Beckham switched to No. 1, and he has worn it ever since. The No. 1 overall draft choice in 2008, Beckham now bats first for the Baltimore Orioles. Either would be a plausible reason for wearing No. 1, but neither explains Beckham’s choice. “If you give me the opportunity to play every day, I think I’m the best shortstop in baseball,” Beckham said this month after a workout on the back fields behind Ed Smith Stadium. “Everyone has their own opinion, but I feel like that 1 on my back is the confidence I have in myself. It’s a reminder that when I put my jersey on every day, you need to be the best person on the field.” This remains Beckham’s only goal. Last season was his 10th as a professional but just his first as an everyday player in the majors. Buster Posey, who was picked four spots after Beckham, won three World Series titles for the San Francisco Giants before Beckham made his second start in the majors. Now Beckham is learning a new position, third base, as the Orioles accommodate Manny Machado’s wish to move to shortstop. Beckham has started just five pro games at third base, and he acknowledged he had a long way to go. It is a familiar feeling — the story of Beckham’s career, really — but he loves a challenge. As a boy in Georgia, he would find thrills in the most mundane tasks. If he heated up food in the microwave, Beckham said, he would try to make a pitcher of Kool-Aid before the timer went off. Anything to push himself. “I’d like to consider myself a perpetual competitor,” Beckham said. “I’m blessed with that.” The Orioles finished 75-87 last season for their first losing record since 2011. But they stood just a game out of a wild-card spot as late as Sept. 5, with Beckham fueling an unlikely surge. Acquired from the Rays in a July 31 trade for the Class A pitcher Tobias Myers, Beckham hit safely in his first 12 games for Baltimore, batting .531. His final August average was .394, with 15 multi-hit games. “The first time a guy is traded, you’ve got a window of opportunity you can walk through,” Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said. “But I never dreamed he would have the month he had. I mean, he was unbelievable. There wasn’t a better player in the American League for a month.” Dan Duquette, the Orioles’ executive vice president for baseball operations, knows all about players thriving in new environments. In 2013, he traded a player who was 27, still with his first team, and who had never quite translated his talent to consistent success. That player was Jake Arrieta, who went on to stardom for the Chicago Cubs. Beckham was the Arrieta of the Rays: 27 years old last summer, in his fourth major league season with his only team, undeniably talented but going nowhere. The Orioles had seen plenty of Beckham, in spring training and the A.L. East, and they liked his tools. “He can run, he can throw, he’s an excellent athlete,” Duquette said. “It looked to me like he was learning how to hit and use his power. And he was hungry — he wanted to play every day, and he didn’t get the opportunity.” In Baltimore, Beckham said with a clear measure of pride, he did not miss a game until he needed a root canal in late September. He struggled that month but still finished with a .306 average for the Orioles and a .782 on-base plus slugging percentage for the entire season — matching Machado and ranking seventh among 20 everyday major league shortstops. For Beckham, it was vindication for all the time he believed he should have been starting for the Rays. He missed 50 games in 2012 after a second positive test for marijuana, and missed most of 2014 with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. But he never understood why the Rays acquired so many veteran shortstops — Yunel Escobar, Asdrubal Cabrera, Adeiny Hechavarria, Brad Miller, Matt Duffy — instead of seeing what he could do. “You can’t get locked in unless you’re playing every day, unless you’re given an opportunity to fail and they run you back out there,” Beckham said. “If I go 0 for 4 in Tampa, I might not play for four days, and then the next at-bat I get might be against Zach Britton.” As a right-handed hitter, Beckham would often play against All-Star left-handers like Britton, Chris Sale and David Price, who combined to hold him to two hits in 28 at-bats with the Rays. His pedigree made his lack of playing time stand out. “I’m 1-1, so how does that happen?” Beckham said, referring to first pick, first round. “Now everyone’s looking at me — ‘he’s not doing this, he’s not playing well.’ No, I’m not playing at all.” Beckham did play regularly for the Rays last season, mostly because of injuries to Miller and Duffy. Facing a logjam in late July, Tampa Bay traded him and promptly fell out of the playoff race. The Rays did not have a winning record after Aug. 11, and the tenure of their former top pick had ended with a thud. “I wouldn’t describe it as not working out. I really wouldn’t,” Rays General Manager Erik Neander said, explaining that, by the end, Beckham had finally blossomed. “Certainly, what he accomplished in Baltimore further cemented that, and we’re happy for him in that regard. “For us, hindsight helps a lot. But at the time with our infield situation, the way the at-bats were going to be allocated, we felt we were going to move someone, and that’s the way we went.” Neander said the Rays liked Myers and had depth in right-handed infielders like Beckham. They have since acquired even more, in deals that sent Longoria to San Francisco and starter Jake Odorizzi to the Minnesota Twins, right fielder Steven Souza Jr. to Arizona and left fielder Corey Dickerson to Pittsburgh. A rebuild is on for the Rays, and Beckham is happy in a city where nobody cares that he is not Buster Posey. “Good for him for all the accolades he’s gotten and deserves — he’s a heck of a catcher, a heck of a baseball player,” Beckham said. “With that being said, me getting a chance to play every day and getting on a winning ball club and a winning organization with the history of the Baltimore Orioles, I look to do the same thing.” To Beckham, there is simply no doubt. He will work as hard as he can to learn third base, but shortstop could be his again, if Machado is traded or leaves as a free agent next winter. Beckham knows he can still be a star, wherever the Orioles put him. It says so right on his back. “I will be,” he said. “I will be. As long as I’m playing every day, I’m going to be a star player.”",6852
5a9588ee410cf7000162e3db,2018-02-27T16:35:53+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/sports/vegas-golden-knights-raiders.html,Sports,"LAS VEGAS — Mary Kelly and her husband, Thomas Lindqvist, are the type of fans that sports executives in Las Vegas dream about. When the N.H.L. released its schedule last summer, Kelly and Lindqvist saw that their beloved Pittsburgh Penguins would visit Las Vegas to play the expansion Golden Knights on a Thursday in mid-December. Eager to see their team play in the newest N.H.L. city, Kelly, Lindqvist and a dozen friends planned a long weekend around the Penguins game. They booked rooms on the Strip, at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, and spent the weekend seeing the sights. “We bought tickets as soon as they went on sale,” said Kelly, who has had Penguins season tickets with her husband for a decade. “We go to about one road game a year, to Chicago, Buffalo, New York, D.C.” Before game time in Las Vegas, she looked across a plaza outside T-Mobile Arena, where many hundreds of Penguins fans were congregating, and said: “We did not expect to see this.” It’s fair to say the owners of the Golden Knights, the N.H.L. and the city of Las Vegas did not expect that, either. By most measures, the hockey team’s inaugural season has been a smashing success — one the Raiders hope to duplicate when they move to the city from Oakland for the 2020 N.F.L. season. With 41 wins and 87 points through Monday, the Golden Knights have been extending the record for most wins by an N.H.L. expansion team week after week. In first place in the Western Conference, they are the second-highest scoring team in the league and look poised for a playoff run. A big reason for the Golden Knights’ success is their play at T-Mobile Arena, where they are 24-5-2. Through the first 31 home games, the team averaged 17,969 fans, or 103.5 percent of the arena’s capacity, when including standing room tickets. All 44 luxury suites have been rented. The team sold its entire allotment of 12,500 season tickets, and Kerry Bubolz, the team president, told LVSportsBiz.com this month that about 2,500 fans had paid deposits to be part of the season-ticket waiting list. According to Fanatics, the largest online seller of licensed sports goods, the Golden Knights have ranked fourth in N.H.L. merchandise sales this season — and first since the start of 2018. The fast start by the Golden Knights has, for now, allayed fears that the N.H.L.’s decision to put another team in a desert city would lead to financial trouble. (See: Coyotes, Arizona.) Commissioner Gary Bettman has for years pushed for new teams in the Sun Belt, with mixed success, and aiming for Las Vegas, in particular, seemed like an overreach. It is the country’s 40th largest television market, best known as a destination for tourists and gamblers, and has a population heavy on retirees and service industry workers, who are unlikely candidates to spend thousands of dollars on season tickets. The city had little hockey tradition; it has hosted minor league teams but has few ice rinks or youth leagues. But an influx of out-of-town fans has complemented the Golden Knights’ fast start on the ice and at the box office. This is good news for local hotels, restaurants and casinos, which host 43 million visitors a year, and for the team as it gets its bearings in the market. Other N.H.L. teams in areas that attract transplanted retirees — like the Arizona Coyotes and the Florida Panthers — also tend to have strong crowds supporting the opposition. The Golden Knights, though, appear to have specifically designed their game nights like most things in their city: as tourist attractions. While hockey is certainly the central focus of game nights, the Knights have added a medieval motif, sometimes comically. The Zambonis that drive on the ice have jousts mounted on their sides to simulate a duel. The arena includes a 24-foot knight’s helmet and three castle structures, including one for cheerleaders with pompoms. Catapults are used to launch T-shirts into the crowd. “We wanted to focus on Vegas as the entertainment capital of the world,” Bubolz said. The Golden Knights’ success, camp and all, is an encouraging sign for the N.F.L., which last year approved the Raiders’ plan to relocate to Nevada. (The San Antonio Stars of the W.N.B.A. moved to Las Vegas in the off-season, and will begin play as the Las Vegas Aces in May.) But the definition of success will be far different. While the Knights play in a privately built arena, Nevada promised to use $750 million in hotel taxes to help pay for a new, domed stadium for the Raiders. The bonanza of public money persuaded the league’s owners to let the team move, and melted the N.F.L.’s long-running objections to playing in Las Vegas — based on the presence of legal sports gambling. The Raiders hope to double down on the Knights’ success at drawing out-of-town visitors. In most N.F.L. markets, roughly 5 percent of fans at a typical game are from out of town. Yet according to the Raiders’ projections, about half the fans at the 10 Raiders home games will come from outside Las Vegas, including many from neighboring California. “As far back as a decade, we all believed teams would travel very well to Las Vegas,” said Bill Hornbuckle, the president of MGM Resorts International and a member of the Las Vegas Stadium Authority, which has negotiated specifics of the stadium deal with the Raiders. Sporting events in Las Vegas, he added, “make what is normally a three-hour experience into a three-day experience.” Hornbuckle said that of the 48,000 fans who had paid a deposit for personal seat licenses, which will probably cost between $4,000 and $6,000, 48 percent were from Southern Nevada. But nearly 30 percent were from Southern California, and the remainder from elsewhere in the country. But while the Golden Knights moved into a pre-existing arena, the Raiders are responsible for construction of their stadium. The team, though, will have to cover only about one-third of the estimated $1.8 billion price tag. The rest will come from the hotel tax, an N.F.L. contribution of $200 million and an estimated $250 million from the fans’ seat license fees. The Raiders will operate the stadium and keep all revenue from every event there, not only football games. An existing monorail, which was privately financed, may be extended to reach the stadium and ease concerns about traffic and a lack of parking. Jim Nagourney, a former sports executive in New York who now lives in Las Vegas, has repeatedly criticized the arrangement with the Raiders, which could require taxpayers to cover any shortfall in the hotel tax revenue. He said the number of available parking spaces was too small, and he questioned whether half of the stadium’s 65,000 seats could be filled with out-of-town fans. Attendance for preseason games is notoriously spotty, and if the Raiders play poorly, their fans from outside Las Vegas may be less likely to travel long distances to see them, he said. Nagourney also said the assumption that fans would stay for nearly three days was based on visitors for conventions, not sports events. He does not believe it was necessary to bring the Golden Knights and the Raiders to Las Vegas to validate the city’s status. “It was a prestige thing,” Nagourney said. “But find me a map that doesn’t already have Las Vegas on it.”",7276
5a953dd5410cf7000162e2ec,2018-02-27T11:15:25+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/sports/usa-gymnastics-team.html,Sports,"The United States women’s gymnastics team has no coordinator. It has no training center. It has lost its biggest sponsors. Its governing body is under investigation by multiple congressional committees and recently jettisoned its entire board of directors. From the biggest sexual abuse case in sports, the institution of U.S.A. Gymnastics has emerged tattered and disgraced: censured for systematically failing to report predators, accused of fostering abusive training environments and condemned by many of its own stars. But there are still gymnasts training 30 to 40 hours a week in pursuit of lifelong dreams: National team membership. World titles. The 2020 Olympics. They are distinct from their governing body. And they are worried that this reckoning, essential though it is, will hold them back in a sport whose window for success can be painfully short. “We don’t have a year or two to settle down,” Margzetta Frazier, 18, a member of the national team, wrote this month in a tweet liked more than 1,200 times. “We cannot put our bodies on hold. Time is not on our side.” On Feb. 4, at least 20 elite gymnasts — including almost every national team member — posted a photo on Instagram or Twitter of a lineup at a national training camp, accompanied by a chain-link emoji and the hashtag #wst, short for “we stand together.” The message was twofold, several of them said in interviews: solidarity with the more than 250 women abused by the former national team doctor, and determination not to let the catastrophic failings of the sport’s officials derail its athletes. Jordan Chiles, 16, the runner-up at last year’s national championships, said the hashtag campaign “was something we decided to do together to show our support to our teammates, to our sport and to let everyone know that we are still standing strong. That we are unbreakable links in a chain.” Few gymnasts say they will miss Martha and Bela Karolyi’s Texas ranch, where the women’s national team trained for nearly 20 years until U.S.A. Gymnastics cut ties in January. Many were molested there by the former team doctor Lawrence G. Nassar, and the Karolyis are accused of creating an environment that both facilitated his predation and was abusive in its own right. In the past week, both The Associated Press and The Dallas Morning News published major investigations of mistreatment there. But many gymnasts do miss the monthly camps where they trained with the national team staff and performed their routines as though they were in competition. Contenders for approaching international events attended a selection camp at Louisiana State University on Sunday, but the regular camps have not been held since November. “Camps are not just about training,” said Olivia Dunne, 15, who has attended them since she was 10. “At each camp, we compete and get experience completing routines under pressure.” Jade Carey, 17, a double medalist at last year’s world championships, said the hiatus had made it difficult to receive guidance from the national staff. And because few gyms have more than one elite gymnast at a time, many national team members — far more skilled than anyone around them in daily training — count on the camps to show them their competition. At home, Adeline Kenlin, 15, is “a big fish in a little pond,” her coach Mary Wise said. “We look forward to the training camps as an environment that pushes her.” Valeri Liukin’s resignation as national team coordinator this month, less than two years after he took over from Martha Karolyi, also came as a shock. Liukin said at the time that he had been “looking forward to trying to turn this program around,” but that “the present climate causes me, and more importantly my family, far too much stress, difficulty and uncertainty.” Asked whether they were worried that the institutional upheaval would affect their ability to compete internationally, gymnasts said it already had. U.S.A. Gymnastics has withdrawn from two competitions — the International Gymnix in Canada, held in March, and the City of Jesolo Trophy in Italy, held in April — that are often the first international experience for new national team members. At least eight gymnasts, including Kenlin, have arranged to compete individually in Jesolo at their own expense. Beyond the practical difficulties of being a national team member without the accouterments of a national team, gymnasts are struggling to come to terms with a harsh spotlight. The current and former athletes speaking out against U.S.A. Gymnastics have made a point to distinguish between the organization and the sport. But to some not involved in gymnastics, the revelations of abuse seem to define it. In one widely shared article last month, a Sports Illustrated columnist declared: “American gymnastics is no longer a sport. It’s a conspiracy of pedophiles and their enablers.” The notion that American gymnastics was synonymous with the failures of its governing body has not sat well with American gymnasts, including Simone Biles, the 2016 Olympic all-around champion. Biles, 20, a survivor of Nassar’s abuse who began training again last year, wrote pointedly on Twitter that gymnasts “don’t stop working hard just because our organization is falling apart.” Asked what they wanted the public to know, every gymnast interviewed said largely the same thing. None disputed the importance of organizational and cultural change in U.S.A. Gymnastics. But they did not want their work and goals to be ignored. “There are still kids working hard,” Kenlin said. “There are still kids trying to achieve their dreams.” “There will always be unexpected ups and downs on the road to success,” Carey added, “but we will continue to support each other and not let anything or anyone destroy us or our love for gymnastics.” Wise, Kenlin’s coach, said it sometimes felt as if, in the push to make the sport safe for future generations, the current generation had been forgotten. “These kids are working hard, and we are hoping that their dreams don’t get damaged by the ripple effect from what has happened,” she said. “Their dreams are important. We want to see them have their chance, too.”",6170
5a94cc6b410cf7000162e1ee,2018-02-27T03:11:31+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/sports/basketball/knicks-warriors.html,Sports,"The youthful Knicks put up a surprisingly stiff fight against the mighty Golden State Warriors in the first half on Monday night, sneaking into the locker room with a 64-63 lead at Madison Square Garden. But it took just 41 seconds in the second half for the Warriors to retake the lead, and a subsequent 11-0 run started what would be a machine-like third quarter for the Warriors. They outscored the Knicks by 39-18 in the period en route to an eventual 125-111 victory. What had looked like a close game ended with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant cheering on their teammates from the sidelines as they sat out the entire fourth quarter. Golden State’s Klay Thompson led all scorers with 26 points on 9 of 13 shooting, and all five of the Warriors’ starters scored in double-digits. Curry finished with 21 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists, Durant had 22 points and 9 rebounds, and the team shot 15 of 31 from 3-point range. It was Golden State’s 35th game this season in which the team had 30 or more assists, and the team’s record improved to 31-4 in such games. The story of this game, however, was Golden State’s second-half defense. After initially struggling to contain a free-flowing Knicks offense, the Warriors completely shut things down after halftime. They harassed the Knicks on both ends of the court, with Draymond Green, JaVale McGee and Durant largely leading what was a teamwide effort. After the game, Coach Steve Kerr of the Warriors acknowledged that his team had a tendency to run away with games in the third quarter, but said it was more about the team having four All-Stars than anything he was doing. “It’s not like we’re making big adjustments or anything,” he said. “I think it’s a mentality shift for the players, knowing that they’re in a fight down 1 at the half, and they tend to pick up their focus.” The first half ended with the Knicks on top thanks to a 3-pointer by Lance Thomas that connected as the halftime buzzer rang. It was the culmination of a half in which the Knicks played Warriors-style basketball, with a great deal of ball movement and solid shooting, fighting their way back every time it looked like Golden State was making a run. Emmanuel Mudiay, who had been ice-cold from outside in the five games since coming to the Knicks in a trade with the Denver Nuggets, had 18 points in the first half, shooting 3 for 4 from 3-point range. He had begun his Knicks career by going 0 for 13 on 3-pointers. He finished the day with a team-leading 23 points, and added seven assists. Mudiay got plenty of help from Trey Burke and Frank Ntilikina, who finished with 18 and 13 points, but the Knicks’ offense took a major hit when Michael Beasley was forced out of the game late in the first half so he could be treated for a bad cut to his eyebrow sustained when Green’s elbow hit his face as the two fought for space under the basket. Beasley, who received five stitches according to the Knicks’ medical staff, returned in the second half but finished the game with just 2 points. The win was the second in a row for the Warriors, who briefly moved back into a tie at the top of the Western Conference standings before the Houston Rockets regained their half-game lead with a win over the Utah Jazz later Monday. The Knicks lost for the 10th time in 11 games.",3301
5a94b61c410cf7000162e1cc,2018-02-27T01:36:20+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/sports/baseball/russell-wilson-yankees.html,Sports,"TAMPA, Fla. — Russell Wilson looked very much at home in pinstripes Monday, when he suited up to take batting practice and ground balls with the Yankees. Wilson, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback and former minor league baseball player, whose rights were acquired by the Yankees during the off-season, smoothly fielded grounders at second base and did not look out of place while taking swings in a group with the Yankees’ biggest sluggers: Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Gary Sanchez and Greg Bird. Wilson muscled six balls over the wall with his 33 ½-inch, 31-ounce Russell Wilson-model bat — including on a last-pitch situational drill: two outs, bottom of the ninth. “I think he’s been out here early taking swings, because he took a couple out to left, and he took one out to center,” Judge said. “I think he’s been practicing.” Wilson, though, insisted the only work he had done was some soft-toss drills over the weekend. “I’ve been doing it my whole life ever since I was 2, 3, 4 years old,” said Wilson, who participated in spring training drills in 2013 and 2014 with the Texas Rangers, the team that previously held his rights. “This is what I know. This is what I’ve known my whole life. Now, I couldn’t just go step on the basketball court. But baseball — it’s like riding a bike.” Wilson plans to spend the week working out with the Yankees, but will not play in any exhibition games for fear of injury — though he is not prohibited from doing so by the Seahawks. If Wilson moved easily among the Yankees on Monday — he also addressed the team in a meeting — there are a number of Yankees who have enough football bona fides to find some common ground. Infielder Jace Peterson was a free safety at McNeese State, and the third-base coach Phil Nevin was a freshman all-American at Cal State Fullerton. Then there were others who could have played in college: Pitcher C. C. Sabathia signed a letter of intent to play tight end at Hawaii; Jacoby Ellsbury, who returned six kickoffs for touchdowns in high school, was recruited by Oregon; and Sonny Gray was an accomplished quarterback growing up in Tennessee, where he had several scholarship offers before sticking with baseball at Vanderbilt. But the two Yankees who most likely had the best chance to forge a career in football are the two who look the part — Stanton and Judge. Stanton is 6 feet 6 inches, 245 pounds, and Judge is 6-foot-7, 282 pounds. Both were star receivers in high school — coincidentally, each wore No. 2 — before dropping football in favor of a baseball career. “They’d definitely be tight ends,” Wilson said. “We have a running joke, me and Jimmy Graham, how he looks like Aaron Judge and how Judge looks like him,” Wilson added, referring to Seattle’s five-time Pro Bowl tight end. “I was telling Aaron earlier, Jimmy, I think, wore his jersey for Halloween.” While Stanton was an elite baseball prospect at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, Calif., he did not catch the eye of college football recruiters until his senior season — when in the season opener he caught a touchdown pass and scored on the ensuing 2-point conversion to win the game, leaping above a defender for both balls. Stanton took a recruiting visit to Southern California, attending a football game and having lunch over the weekend with Pete Carroll, then the U.S.C. football coach and now Wilson’s coach with the Seahawks. Carroll also came to watch Stanton play basketball. “Mike was an excellent prospect in high school, and we knew he had a ton of potential,” Carroll said via email through a team spokesman. “We truly saw him as a multisport athlete, which is rare at that level. He was so good at both sports that we would have wanted him to play both if he came to ‘SC.’” In his two years at Notre Dame — he transferred to the private school after spending two years at Verdugo Hills, a public school — Stanton played with at least 10 others who earned college scholarships. One of Stanton’s more memorable matchups came against one of Wilson’s teammates — the loquacious Richard Sherman. What did Stanton remember about it? “I just remember them kicking our butts,” said Stanton, whose team had its 35-game winning streak ended by Sherman’s Dominguez High School in a 41-14 route in the CIF-Southern Section Division III championship game. “They wore us down.” “They were talking crap, but I didn’t put it to just Sherman,” added Stanton, who was sometimes matched up against Sherman. “They were all talking stuff because they were the inner-city school and we were the privileged school. I went to public school, too, so I know what they were feeling.” Brandon Huffman, the national recruiting editor for 24/7 Sports, recalled how fast and fluid Stanton looked. “It was like he glided downfield,” Huffman said. “It didn’t look like he was that fast, but he had long strides. It was like watching a center fielder who knows how much ground he has to cover.” Judge, like Stanton, was a three-sport standout, playing football, basketball and baseball in Linden, Calif., a Central Valley farming community just east of Stockton. While Judge received recruiting interest from Notre Dame, Washington and U.C.L.A., he made it clear to most schools that he was interested in playing only baseball. A few, such as Eastern Michigan and Portland State, offered to let him play both, but Judge thought playing two sports — along with the academic challenges of college — would be too much, so he focused on baseball at Fresno State. “I thought if I could find a place where I could just play baseball, that would be great,” he said. Further dampening the idea of playing football was the fact that he might not have played receiver. Judge, who was a Cal fan — in part because his older brother John went to school there — attended a football camp in Berkeley before his senior season. “They knew I enjoyed football, but that I had baseball on the mind,” Judge said. “The receiver coach said, ‘I like you, but we’ll bulk you up and put you at tight end, to be honest.’” If that idea did not appeal to Judge at the time, he did not seem put off that Wilson viewed him as a tight end, figuring that Wilson would make him look good with a few passes. Wilson did not have a football with him, but said he would by the end of the week. Just as he is showing off what he might do with a baseball bat in his hands, Judge and Stanton might be able to show what they can do with a football in theirs. “You might catch us out on a backfield running some routes,” Judge said with a smile. INSIDE PITCH Outfielder Clint Frazier was found to have a concussion. He had complained of fogginess and a headache after crashing into the outfield wall twice in Saturday’s game against Pittsburgh. Frazier said Monday that he felt fine and would ride a stationary bike on Tuesday to determine if exercise would cause the symptoms to return.",6883
5a94b277410cf7000162e1c7,2018-02-27T01:20:47+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/sports/tennis/davis-cup-itf-pique.html,Sports,"It is a pity it had to come to this, but with Davis Cup withering and rival events surfacing, the feeling was that something had to give. On Monday, tradition did. In what would arguably be the biggest change to the Davis Cup since its creation in 1900, the International Tennis Federation announced plans to transform the annual national-team competition through what it called a 25-year, $3 billion partnership with an international investment group headed by the Spanish soccer star Gerard Piqué. The lucrative proposal, which requires final approval in August by the I.T.F.’s general membership, would change the top level of Davis Cup into a weeklong event in November involving 18 nations, with best-of-three-set matches played at a single site. The plan is to implement the overhaul for 2019, but approval, in light of the general membership’s conservative voting record, is far from guaranteed. “It’s politically tricky and no sure thing that this gets rubber-stamped,” Jim Courier, the American Davis Cup captain, said in an interview on Monday while expressing support for the plan. Currently, 16 men’s teams play in Davis Cup’s top division, known as the World Group, in a home-and-away format over four rounds interspersed throughout the season, and all live matches are best of five sets. Some former Davis Cup champions, like Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, consider the proposal a travesty. “Terrible,” Kafelnikov said in an interview Monday. “The value and spirit of the whole team competition is gone.” But like many influential figures in the game, I.T.F. President David Haggerty is convinced that big moves are necessary to keep the event relevant. Haggerty said the proposal had received unanimous support from the I.T.F.’s board of directors. Though mild-mannered in person, Haggerty is unafraid to make bold moves (if this one fails, his bid for re-election in 2019 certainly will suffer, too). A former tennis industry executive and a former president of the United States Tennis Association, Haggerty was among those who pushed successfully for a roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open and for the U.S.T.A.’s vast new complex at Lake Nona in Orlando, Fla. “Certainly this is a big decision for the I.T.F.,” Haggerty said by telephone from London on Monday. “We know the environment has changed in tennis over the last few years. Players are playing later in their careers. It’s a very physical sport, so I think many factors were taken into account. “At the same time, if you go back 50 years ago, in Bournemouth they had the first Open tennis event. There had to have been a number of tennis leaders sitting around saying, ‘Jeez, tennis is O.K., do we really need to make this change? What is it going to do to us? Is it good or bad?’ You never know, so that strength of conviction, they had that at the time. They took a risk, but look how tennis has changed. Perhaps in the future, we will look back on this and say the I.T.F. board took such a risk.” Haggerty also wants a more solid financial base for the I.T.F., which has become the weakest pillar among the sport’s bloated network of governing bodies. The money could indeed be transformative: Haggerty said the partnership with Kosmos, the investment firm headed by Piqué and backed by the 52-year-old Japanese billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani, would provide more than $20 million in prize money for the players in the final phase each year. If the $3 billion figure is correct, it would also provide the I.T.F., whose main source of revenue is Davis Cup, with an unheard-of influx of cash to fund its own activities, which include developing the game worldwide and running amateur and lower-level professional circuits. Haggerty also said that national federations would benefit. If the overhaul is approved, only the seasons ahead will determine who was correct in their assessment: the Kafelnikovs or the Haggertys. But one can understand the lure and the timing. Despite pockets of passion, and a compelling history, Davis Cup is losing traction globally. There were certainly less extreme potential solutions: A partnership with the ATP Tour; shifting the Davis Cup dates away from such proximity to Grand Slam tournaments; or switching to a biennial format that might have lured the biggest stars. But after being thwarted last year in an attempt to tweak the format with smaller changes, like using a neutral-site final and best-of-three-set singles matches, Haggerty doubled down and pushed instead for more radical change. At least initially, the event would most likely be held in Asia, Haggerty said, and because of the number of courts required, it would most likely be staged outdoors. “The next step in my view to make this event all it could be would be to include the Fed Cup in this tennis extravaganza,” Courier said, referring to the I.T.F’s women’s team competition. “That should be the ultimate goal.” For now, the I.T.F. is focused on expanding Fed Cup’s top division from eight to 16 teams, although Haggerty expressed support for a similar, single-site Fed Cup competition in the future. In the Davis Cup proposal, the plan is for the 18 national teams to be divided into six groups of three for round-robin play over three days. Each team would have four players, and each encounter would include two singles matches and one doubles match. Eight teams would advance to the quarterfinals (the six group winners plus the two best second-place teams) and would be guaranteed a spot in the following year’s final phase. During the week, the strongest eight of the 10 eliminated teams would then play for a place in the following year’s competition against the eight teams who have come through home-and-away qualifying during the Davis Cup’s traditional dates earlier in the season. The semifinals would be played on Saturday, and the final on Sunday. “The nice thing is that by the end of the week, you’ll know the 16 teams playing in next year’s event,” Haggerty said. He said the 17th and 18th teams would be selected by the I.T.F. and Kosmos “based on criteria to be determined.” Such an overhaul would have been unthinkable in Davis Cup’s heyday, when its prestige was on par with the four Grand Slam tournaments in the 1930s, ’40s and ’50s. But those moments are long gone, even if Davis Cup continues to generate big crowds and enthusiasm in several countries, including France, which won the title for the 10th time last year. But many leading players and tennis officials have been clamoring for a change in format for decades. In this golden age in the men’s game, the biggest stars — including Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — have all been part of winning Davis Cup teams but have rarely participated at the same time as one another and have faced each other too rarely in the event. Also, rival national-team events with shorter formats have surfaced, including the Laver Cup, which was started successfully last year by Roger Federer’s management company, pitting a European Team against an International Team. But the biggest threat was the ATP’s recent interest in relaunching the single-week World Team Cup, which could have further reduced top players’ interest in committing to Davis Cup. Piqué’s group, with support from Djokovic, first negotiated with the ATP and its executive chairman Chris Kermode about creating such an event before turning to the I.T.F. in late November. The result was Monday’s announcement. The Davis Cup — and tennis — may never be the same.",7510

T. Miller to the Tampa Bay Lightning for three players and two draft picks. McDonagh’s departure, which came a day after the Rangers traded forward Rick Nash to the Boston Bruins, completed for now a roster dismantling that the Rangers had warned their fans was coming. The Rangers last week dealt Nick Holden to the Bruins and sent Michael Grabner, their leading goal scorer, to the Devils, leaving them to move forward as a last-place team stripped of some of its most popular and reliable names with 19 games to go. The Rangers signaled that big changes were coming two weeks ago in a letter from the team president, Glen Sather, and General Manager Jeff Gorton, telling fans that the team “may lose some familiar faces, guys we all care about and respect” in order to add young, skillful players. In Monday’s deal, the Rangers acquired the 25-year-old Russian forward Vladislav Namestnikov and two prospects: Brett Howden and Libor Hajek. The Rangers also got Tampa Bay’s first-round pick in June’s draft and a conditional second-round draft pick in 2019, which will become a first-round selection if the Lightning, who lead the Atlantic Division, win the Stanley Cup this year or in 2019. “It hit on a lot of things we wanted to accomplish as far as acquiring high picks and getting young players we’ve really liked for a while,” Gorton said on Monday. “We’re getting some younger players we can really build around.” The Rangers, who have lost seven straight, now have three first-round picks (one of which was acquired in the Nash deal), two second-rounders and two third-rounders for the June draft in Dallas. The raft of picks could be parlayed into even more deals after this season. The Rangers are 3-13-1 in their last 17 games and are almost certain to miss the playoffs for the first time since 2010. They are focusing instead on building their roster for the future. Namestnikov, a first-round pick by the Lightning in 2011, is the only player currently on an N.H.L. roster whom the Rangers acquired through their deals over the past two weeks. A 5-foot-11-inch forward, Namestnikov has 20 goals and 24 assists this season and will be a restricted free agent this summer. The 19-year-old Howden is a 6-foot-3, 200-pound center who was Tampa Bay’s first-round pick two years ago and is in his third season with the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League. Hajek, 20, is a 6-foot-2 defenseman from the Czech Republic picked in the second round in 2016. The 28-year-old McDonagh, who became the Rangers’ captain in October 2014 after Ryan Callahan was traded to the Lightning for Martin St. Louis, has not played since a 6-1 home loss to Boston on Feb. 7 because of an unspecified upper-body injury. After that defeat, a clearly frustrated McDonagh said it was “one of the worst games of my career and one of the worst games I’ve ever been a part of in my Rangers career.” McDonagh had two goals and 24 assists before his injury this season. A first-round selection by the Montreal Canadiens in 2007, he joined the Rangers via trade in June 2009. “It’s a very difficult thing to do,” Gorton said of trading McDonagh. “He’s a player we view as a really special Ranger, the captain of our team.” The trade reunites McDonagh with his former defense partner Dan Girardi, as well as the former Ranger Anton Stralman. McDonagh and Girardi were a crucial blueline duo for the Rangers when they reached the 2014 Stanley Cup finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Kings in five games. McDonagh’s contract expires after next season. The 24-year-old Miller was in his sixth season with the Rangers, who selected him 15th over all in the 2011 draft. He had 13 goals and 27 assists in 63 games but seemed out of sync at times this season with Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault shifting him between center and wing. The Rangers have been lacking true centers since trading Derek Stepan to Arizona last June. That has surely been a reason for their struggles this season. They are last in the Metropolitan Division before starting a three-game trip in Vancouver on Wednesday.",4231
5a947ed5410cf7000162e121,2018-02-26T21:19:43+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/sports/baseball/mets-pitching-rotation.html,Sports,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Mickey Callaway and Dave Eiland know about pitching talent. Callaway, the Mets’ new manager, was the Cleveland Indians’ pitching coach when they won two division titles, reached the World Series in 2016 and posted one of the finest pitching seasons in baseball history last year. Eiland, the Mets’ new pitching coach, held the same position with two World Series-winning teams: the 2009 Yankees and the 2015 Kansas City Royals. Yet as they watched the Mets’ gifted but oft-injured pitching staff throw recently at the team’s spring training complex, Callaway and Eiland had a similar epiphany. “I’ve been around some pretty good arms, and this is the best group of arms and stuff I’ve ever seen from top to bottom,” Callaway said. Eiland added, “Not to downplay anywhere else I’ve ever been, but I’ve never been around a collection of talent like I’m around here.” And those comments came before the Mets reached a deal more than a week ago to add the veteran left-handed starter Jason Vargas, a much-needed move to get a reliable arm into an unreliable rotation. The ripple effects were also critical: Vargas on board meant strengthened depth and a fortified bullpen. “I don’t think you can have too much pitching,” Callaway said. Last year, the Mets didn’t have enough. They headed into the 2017 season with eight starters — Noah Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom, Steven Matz, Matt Harvey, Zack Wheeler, Seth Lugo, Robert Gsellman and Rafael Montero — but most of that group ended up injured or pitched poorly, the most obvious reason for a 70-92 finish. Until recently, the Mets had essentially the same rotation and depth, and the same worry that it might not be enough. “We were somewhat at risk,” General Manager Sandy Alderson said. “But at the same time, we wanted to manage our own expectations.” “You have to remind yourself,” he added, “that there’s this ebb and flow over the course of the season related to health and performance.” The Mets’ ebbs were many last year. Once the team’s backbone, the rotation posted a 5.14 earned run average and logged 865 ⅔ innings, the team’s lowest total in a non-strike-shortened season, and one that increased the strain on an imperfect bullpen. The Mets used 12 starting pitchers last season, just above the major league average over the past couple of years. Historically, the teams with the healthiest rotations are more likely to make the playoffs. “We need to get back to the point where seven or eight guys are starting all of our games, not 11, 12 or 13,” Alderson said. “If we can do that, we’re going to be pretty good. Jason really helps us in that regard.” Vargas posted a 4.16 E.R.A. and an 18-11 record for Kansas City last year, and he was an All-Star thanks to a strong first half. But a different achievement probably mattered more to Alderson and Callaway: Vargas pitched nearly 180 innings, which would have been second on the Mets last year, and his 32 starts would have ranked first. DeGrom (3.53 E.R.A. over 201 innings) was the only Mets starter to pitch all season. Next best was Gsellman, a rookie who threw just under 120. At the time, the Mets’ depth was so strained that they gave 18 starts to Montero (5.52 E.R.A.) and even called up the prospect Chris Flexen (7.88 E.R.A.) from Class AA Binghamton. As free agents languished on the market in this historically sluggish off-season, the Mets saw an opportunity and some affordability in Vargas for two years and $16 million. Although he is 35, Vargas came highly recommended by Eiland, his former pitching coach in Kansas City, for his work ethic and a skill set — guile, movement and mid-80s fastballs — that contrasts with the Mets’ rotation of hard throwers. That he had averaged 190 innings a season for five years until Tommy John surgery in 2015 eased some concerns, too. “I take pride in being somebody that the guys behind me can count on,” Vargas said. “And they’re not going to have to wonder if I’m going to step out there on the field on that fifth day and be able to give them a quality start.” Yet even before signing Vargas, Alderson said he was optimistic the team’s new coaching staff and some revised medical and training protocols would yield better health. Pitchers were given an off-season throwing program, and Callaway and Eiland were diligent about regular check-ins. The results have been positive in initial spring training starts: Wheeler, who used bone-strengthening medicine in the off-season, has hit 97 miles per hour with his fastball already; Gsellman’s sinker was improved after off-season shoulder exercises; and Lugo looked sharp after a winter spent building strength around his elbow. Alderson also said the off-season checkups by the training staff had “a lower level of tolerance for variance and idiosyncrasies.” The team believed Syndergaard’s bulking up and improper weight training last winter were factors in the right latissimus tear that forced him to miss four and a half months last season. He has since changed his workouts. “I felt more limber, more athletic and more under control,” Syndergaard said after his spring training debut on Monday. “Pitching is kind of controlled aggression, and I think I was able to control that a little better.” Against the Houston Astros on Monday, Syndergaard looked to be back to his adrenaline-fueled, flame-throwing self, with two perfect innings. Although 11 of his 22 pitches were at least 100 m.p.h., he said he did not feel he was “exerting a whole lot of effort.” He froze Jose Altuve, the reigning American League most valuable player, with a darting 92 m.p.h. changeup. The rest of the once-injured Mets starters — Lugo (elbow), Harvey (shoulder), Matz (elbow surgery), Wheeler (stress injury in upper arm) and Gsellman (hamstring strain) — also appear to be in relatively good health. That did not mean the team’s rotation depth was suddenly better, however. Matz has never pitched a full major league season, and Wheeler hasn’t done so in three years. Harvey, who is a free agent at the end of the season, hasn’t been the same since the 2015 World Series, and Lugo has the specter of Tommy John surgery hanging over him. Gsellman regressed. Montero is out of minor league options. And Flexen is still green. Hence the need for Vargas, who will make his spring debut on Thursday. Although Callaway has said Wheeler is competing for a spot in the starting rotation, Vargas’s arrival could allow Montero, Gsellman, Lugo or Wheeler to be pushed into the major league bullpen, or stashed away in Class AAA Las Vegas. The Mets added even more depth on Monday by signing starter A. J. Griffin, who posted a 5.94 E.R.A. with the Texas Rangers last season, to a minor league deal.",6712
5a947ef8410cf7000162e12d,2018-02-26T20:01:41+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/sports/football/roger-goodell-jerry-jones-nfl.html,Sports,"With the support of many N.F.L. owners, Commissioner Roger Goodell is prepared to escalate his public feud with Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys and long one of the most influential people in the league, by ordering him to pay millions of dollars for his efforts to derail negotiations to renew Goodell’s contract and for his outspoken defense of a star player who was suspended, according to five league officials with direct knowledge of the situation. The punishment will be issued in the coming weeks by Goodell, who will declare that Jones’s actions were detrimental to the league, which rarely shows such acute signs of acrimony among owners and the commissioner’s office. Goodell has been reluctant to be seen as exacting retribution for the way Jones tried to sabotage his contract talks, but he was urged to bring the penalties by several owners who believed that Jones had crossed an unspoken boundary by threatening his colleagues. In November, Jones hired the high-profile lawyer David Boies and said he was prepared to sue the six owners on the league’s compensation committee, which had been working for months on extending Goodell’s contract. Jones also lobbied loudly for running back Ezekiel Elliott not to be penalized, and reportedly tried to influence league officials deciding his case. Elliott had been suspended by the league for six games before the season after the N.F.L. investigated domestic-assault allegations. Jones will be ordered to pay the legal fees that the committee incurred defending itself, as well as the legal expenses the N.F.L. spent defending its decision to suspend Elliott. A spokesman for the Cowboys said the team was unaware of the impending penalties and did not immediately have a comment. A spokesman for the N.F.L. said the league had no comment. The genesis of the issue dates back about a year. In the months before Elliott, the Cowboys’ star running back, was suspended in August, Jones said publicly that his player did not deserve to be penalized after a former girlfriend accused him of domestic violence in an incident that predated his entry into the N.F.L. Jones also tried to influence one of the league’s top investigators, according to ESPN. Elliott was not arrested or charged by prosecutors, but the N.F.L. used statements by a former girlfriend of Elliott’s, along with photos of injuries he was accused of inflicting upon her, to justify the suspension. After Elliott was suspended, Jones continued to support him. Elliott took his case to federal court, where his appeals were ultimately denied. At the same time, Jones, who was a nonvoting member of the compensation committee, tried to persuade many of the league’s owners that Goodell’s contract extension should be far less generous than the one that was being proposed. Jones was aware as early as August that only about 12 percent of Goodell’s compensation was guaranteed, and the rest would be based on whether he and the league met a variety of financial targets. Jones, however, continued to argue that Goodell was being overpaid. Though some owners were sympathetic to his stance, many of them backed away from supporting him when he threatened to sue the members of the compensation committee. The compensation committee includes some of the most powerful owners in the league, and close confidants of the commissioner. The members are the owners of the Chiefs, Falcons, Giants, Patriots, Steelers and Texans. Soon after Elliott exhausted his appeals, Jones hired Boies, who has over the years represented the N.F.L. In early November, Jones told the six owners on the committee that he had hired Boies and was prepared to take them to court to stop them from finalizing Goodell’s deal. That set off an embarrassing volley of letters between lawyers for the compensation committee and Jones, and turned the issue of Goodell’s contract extension into a public talking point just as the league was grappling with the fallout from player protests during the playing of the national anthem. Jones ultimately backed down on his threat to sue, but the ill will remained. At a league meeting in Irving, Tex., in December, Jones was upbraided for his behavior by many owners, including some who rarely weigh in strongly on league issues. At the same meeting, with the support of most owners, Goodell was given a five-year extension. Under its terms, he has the possibility of earning as much as $200 million.",4444

This week, United launched its own YouTube channel. To celebrate, the club placed a vast YouTube logo on its stadium. Underneath it, towering over Busby’s head, was the page’s address. Every other Premier League club has long been on the platform. Now, at last and in style, United has succumbed to the future. For a team that has long been so pioneering and so groundbreaking off the field, United has always seemed curiously hesitant when it comes to social media. This was the first club, after all, to realize the potential in soccer’s emerging markets, and then to work out how to monetize that popularity. United’s formidable financial strength is built, in no small part, on a worldwide network of 65 regional partners, catering for everything from noodles to financial services. There is a formal footwear partner, and an informal footwear partner. United, in a very real sense, has sold its soles, but whatever qualms that might have once existed have long since evaporated. Indeed, the policy has proved so effective that most of its rivals have since started to copy it. That enterprising approach has not necessarily been matched online. United latched onto Facebook’s significance early, and the club regularly boasts about its social imprint in its quarterly calls with investors. But it was not until 2013 that United decided that Twitter was not just — or not only, anyway — a self-indulgent fad. It was the last team in both the Premier League and the Champions League to join. It waited five more years to decide that YouTube, too, is here to stay. Quite why United has been so reticent to enter this brave new world is not clear, though the most obvious explanation may also be the most convincing: If something does not directly drive revenue, the club’s hierarchy — and the Glazer family that sits at its head — has tended not to be especially interested. At last, though, United has taken the plunge. Its channel is already replete with the staples of social media: videos offering exclusive access and behind-the-scenes footage, as well as a raft of famous matches — wins, all of them, obviously — condensed into two-and-a-half-minute highlight reels. Like all social media, YouTube prizes brevity, immediacy, punchiness. The world United has finally entered is one of bite-size content, easily shared hits of pleasure. Whether that is a world this United vintage is suited to is a different matter. As soccer, and sports in general, pivot toward the bright digital horizon, it is worth considering Marshall McLuhan’s adage that the medium is the message. Clubs cannot hope simply to exploit the power and reach of social media without being shaped by them in some way, too. The way audiences consume soccer — and everything else — is changing. Fans no longer have to watch a whole 90-minute match. Often, they do not even need to see extended highlights. United’s audience, and those of its peers, may be time-rich, but it is attention-poor. The minute we are not entertained, there is a powerful temptation to skip forward. You can see goals, in clips of no more than a few seconds, on Twitter. The best tricks or the most egregious errors are replicated in the form of even briefer GIFs. A player can now be reduced to a YouTube compilation lasting barely a couple of minutes. This is the future, and in the future, nobody will pay attention to anything for 15 minutes. That is significant for the way all clubs — and superclubs like United, in particular — are run. Fans and owners of soccer’s great names have always demanded not just success, but style, too. That is ever more pressing now, in an age when teams must not only be beautiful for all 90 minutes, but look spectacular in bite-size chunks, too. There is a reason teams are prepared to spend unimaginable sums on individual players capable of moments of magic, or those who might create some social media buzz. There is a reason, too, beyond some intangible philosophical preference, that more and more teams are choosing to employ coaches who can deliver an adventurous, expansive approach, rather than simply those with the most trophies on their résumés. That, of course, is where José Mourinho comes in, though in truth much the same could be said of his counterpart at Chelsea, Antonio Conte. Neither is an attacking coach in the same way that Pep Guardiola, of Manchester City, or even Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp or Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino is. Mourinho and Conte preach a tactically astute, but inherently cautious, approach. That is not to say that either Mourinho or Conte is a bad coach, or that United or Chelsea is a bad team. But watching United recover to beat Chelsea, 2-1, on Sunday, it was hard not to wonder if this was enough, now, given how much soccer’s priorities have changed. Is it enough, as Mourinho said, for a club of United’s scope and scale to have a “humble attitude,” to be diligent and determined, to eke out victory through gritted teeth? It might be, of course, if the reward at the end was a polished silver trophy with ribbons attached. In the Premier League, at least, though, it will not. United’s win here returned Mourinho’s team to second place in the table, above Liverpool, but it remains far adrift of City. Defeat meant Chelsea fell behind Tottenham Hotspur, into fifth. There are still prizes to play for, of course: Both United and Chelsea might soon reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League; one or both might return to that stage next year, too. But if the worst happens, then what can Mourinho and Conte fall back on? For Klopp and Pochettino — neither of whom, it should be said, has won a trophy with his current team — there is a style and a swagger, a sense that these are teams fans want to watch, teams that make waves, and go viral. Neither United nor Chelsea can say the same. Both have fallen behind City — that much is clear — but in a sense, they are losing ground to Liverpool and Spurs, too, if only in intangibles: They are not as compelling, not as entertaining, not as much fun. There is a desire, at times, to skip ahead. That is at odds with the demands of the YouTube age. This is the world United has stepped into. Now, it is at its mercy.",6480
5a93786d410cf7000162debe,2018-02-26T03:00:56+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/sports/tiger-woods-honda-classic.html,Sports,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. — Technically speaking, the Bear Trap begins at the par-3 15th hole, the first of the three consecutive menacing holes at the Jack Nicklaus-designed Champion course at PGA National Resort and Spa. As Padraig Harrington, a two-time champion here, described it earlier in the week, the sweaty palms start long before that. “I start thinking about it the night before,” Harrington said. On Sunday, Tiger Woods, who entered the final round of this year’s Honda Classic 7 strokes off the lead, reached No. 15 at 3-under for the day, 4 strokes out of the lead. Water guards both the front and right sides of the green, and a large bunker to the left is a magnet for those who bail out. Needing to make birdie, he chose a 6-iron and attacked the front-right pin location. A light wind blew in Woods’s face, eliminating any concern that he might overshoot the 169-yard hole. “I hit that flush,” he said. Woods’s tee shot hung high in the air, then rippled the water hazard. A collective groan rose from the crowd. A double bogey on the hole ultimately removed Woods from the trophy chase, but he still came away with his best finish in three starts since he missed more than 10 months following vertebrae fusion surgery, the fourth back operation of his career. “I thought I had plenty of stick,” Woods said of his water-bound shot. “I don’t know how it ended up short.” Woods followed with a three-putt bogey at No. 16 en route to shooting an even-par 70 for a 72-hole total of 280. Across all four rounds, he played the three Bear Trap holes in 8-over, and was 8-under on the PGA National’s remaining 15 holes. He finished in 12th place, 8 strokes behind the winner, Justin Thomas, who defeated Luke List on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff. The tournament was another encouraging step for Woods. With physical strength having been such a crucial part of his game during his years of dominance, there was concern that his recurring back trouble would stall his career at 14 major championships and 79 PGA Tour wins. But Woods, 42, gave a resounding answer to anyone who thought he would be a sideshow in his latest comeback. His third-round score of 69 marked his first round in the 60s since the 2015 Wyndham Championship, a span of 917 days. Woods flashed signs this week that he was regaining command of his game. He had 14 putts for birdie in the third round, and all but one of them were from inside 25 feet. “It probably was the highest score I could have shot today,” Woods said after Saturday’s round. Whether Woods is truly healthy again, as he claims, there is no denying that he is swinging with renewed ferocity. The warm weather presented perfect conditions for Woods’s back. He ripped a 361-yard drive on No. 10 on Friday, ranked third in driving distance for the week averaging 319 yards and unleashed a blistering 128-mile-per-hour swing. Most impressive, he led the field in proximity to the hole on approach shots, averaging 29 feet 3 inches. Woods’s drives were crooked in his season debut at Torrey Pines, but he survived the cut there on guile and guts and finished tied for 23rd. A week ago at Riviera Country Club, erratic ball-striking led to a career-low 16 greens over two rounds, and a missed cut. Playing in a frisky, fickle wind this week, Woods shaped shots both ways and controlled the trajectory of his ball, scraping the clouds and hitting three-quarter knock-down shots when the situation called for it. His chipping woes, which stymied previous comeback attempts, no longer seem to be a concern. “I don’t want to get ahead of myself,” Woods’s caddie, Joe LaCava, said. “There’s still a lot of work to be done.” At the top of the list is a miss to the left when Woods’s aims left to hit a left-to-right shot. “He’s got to find a go-to safety shot,” said Nick Faldo, the CBS Sports analyst. “Whether he’s good enough to hit a 2-yard fade or 20-yard fade, it has got to fade. You can’t aim left and hit it left. That’s a killer for anyone. If he can perfect that, he can play anywhere.” Count Brandt Snedeker, who played alongside Woods during the third round at Torrey Pines and during the first two rounds of the Honda Classic, among those impressed by the progress Woods already has made. Said Snedeker: “I don’t see it going backward from here.”",4308

Apparently, Rodriguez found the work so agreeable he agreed to return — for what figures to be a relative pittance. Rodriguez worked for the Yankees last season while fulfilling the final year of a 10-year, $275 million contract after being released late in 2016 and eventually retiring. The Yankees did not say what Rodriguez, 42, will earn this year, but he will return to a role that the former Yankees Reggie Jackson, Hideki Matsui and Nick Swisher will also serve in. A Yankees spokesman said he did not know if Rodriguez, who was a guest instructor last year during spring training, would serve in a similar capacity this season. “These are exciting times for the New York Yankees and I do not take this opportunity for granted,” Rodriguez said in a statement released by the team. His continued role as an adviser is something few could have foreseen five years ago, when Rodriguez was engaged in a public feud with Yankees President Randy Levine and had sued the team doctor as he fought a yearlong suspension from baseball over his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Since then, though, Rodriguez has taken steps to rehabilitate his image. He has maintained a high public profile since the Yankees released him. He has courted the singer and actress Jennifer Lopez — occasionally posting photos with her on social media — and was praised for his work as a baseball analyst for Fox the last two postseasons. This season, Rodriguez will work as an analyst for ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball, filling the vacancy created when Aaron Boone departed the network to become manager of the Yankees. Coincidentally, Rodriguez also replaced Boone as the Yankees’ third baseman in 2004 when they acquired him from the Texas Rangers after Boone tore knee ligaments playing basketball in the off-season. Boone, though he knows Rodriguez only casually, said he expected him to be an asset because of his acuity for the game. “Everyone understands how smart of a baseball mind he is, and his ability to communicate that sometimes is really something he’s special with — especially for the younger guys,” Boone said. INSIDE PITCH Manager Aaron Boone said he did not foresee the Yankees adding the free-agent pitchers LANCE LYNN or ALEX COBB, who remain on what has been a depressed market for starting pitching. “At this point, I don’t really see those guys as realistic options, but that’s also something I’ll leave to Cash,” Boone said, referring to General Manager BRIAN CASHMAN  … Seattle Seahawks quarterback RUSSELL WILSON, a former minor league baseball player whose rights the Yankees acquired during the off-season, is expected to be in camp Monday to work out and mingle with the team all week.

Draisaitl, a 22-year-old center, was captivated by a different game: a back-and-forth affair between his native Germany’s Olympic team and its Russian opponent for the gold medal at the Pyeongchang Olympics. “I’m trying to watch it right now,” Draisaitl said, holding off reporters attempting to interview him about the Oilers’ victory, which was decided by a last-second video review that overturned what the Kings believed to be a tying goal. Preoccupied much of the night with Edmonton’s battle against Los Angeles, Draisaitl had to wait until the Oilers’ victory was secured to find out how his countrymen were faring against a heavily-favored Russian team that eventually won, 4-3, in overtime. “We had our own game to play,” Draisaitl said, his eyes fixed on the final minutes from South Korea playing out on a nearby television. Draisaitl’s enthusiasm notwithstanding, interest in the Olympic hockey finale appeared to be muted on a busy night of 12 N.H.L. games, 10 of which were played in arenas at or near their capacity. In the Kings’ locker room at Staples Center, the German forward Tobias Rieder was not watching the gold medal game after his team’s disappointing loss. A recent trade acquisition from the Arizona Coyotes, Rieder had celebrated Germany’s upset of Canada in the Olympic semifinals by wearing a gold jersey at practice on Friday, along with red tape on his black socks to mimic the German flag. Before the Kings took the ice against the Oilers, he had expressed excitement for the gold medal matchup, even if he wasn’t entirely sure what time the final started. “I thought they played at four in the morning,” he said, inadvertently acknowledging a halfhearted interest shared by some fans. “If I came across it when it was on, I would watch it,” the Kings fan Blaine Yanabu said, adding, “For the most part it wasn’t as exciting because N.H.L. players weren’t there.” Yanabu admitted he was unaware that the Olympic gold medal game was taking place around the same time the Kings were to play the Oilers, or even which two countries were playing for the gold. He was, however, still buzzing about the women’s Olympic ice hockey final on Wednesday, in which the United States captured its first gold medal in the event since 1998 with a shootout victory over archrival Canada. NBC announced that 2.9 million viewers had watched that showdown, making it the most-watched late-night program in the history of NBC Sports Network. The figure was a marked decrease from the 4.9 million viewers who watched the same matchup in the 2014 gold medal game at the 2014 Sochi Games, which was broadcast on NBC — though the 2014 final began at noon Eastern time, while this year’s gold medal game began at 11 p.m. Viewership for this year’s Olympic men’s tournament saw a similar decline. The United States men’s eight-round shootout victory over Russia in the 2014 Sochi Games established a record at the time for a hockey game on NBCSN, with 4.1 million viewers. But a 5-1 United States victory over Slovakia this year drew only a third of that number, a sign that rosters without N.H.L. stars and late-night broadcast times were the most obvious things keeping N.H.L. players and coaches — and others — from tuning in. “I miss having the NHL players there but I don’t know that it needs it,” said David Profumo, a Kings fan who attended Saturday’s game in an Adam Deadmarsh Team U.S.A. jersey. “On the men’s side, it’s more even now, instead of Canada having all their big players out there. I mean, hockey is hockey.” Deprived of an opportunity to watch Germany’s gold medal matchup against Russia from start to finish, Rieder said he hoped he would have a chance to at least discuss the game with Draisaitl before the Oilers left the arena. And maybe chat about what might have been in Pyeongchang. “It’s pretty funny,” Rieder said. “We could be there playing in the finals with Germany, but we’ve got to play against each other.”",4239

Generally the athletes that manage to defy gravity for the longest can pull off the most complex maneuvers, positioning themselves for the podium.  New York Times photographers have captured airborne athletes throughout the Pyeongchang Games. Here’s a look at some of their favorites photos.  In the newest Olympic sport, big air, athletes shoot down a 49-meter-high hill and launch themselves off a ramp. The sport consists of that one jump and as many tricks athletes can fit into their time in the sky. It’s called big air for a reason.  Jamie Anderson of the United States won the silver medal. Earlier in the week, she won a gold in slopestyle snowboarding.  Halfpipe snowboarders and skiers have more than one chance to go skyward. While traveling down the 170-meter halfpipe, athletes sail — sometimes over 20 feet above the rim — to perform a variety of tricks. They are judged on the degree of difficulty, height and technique.  American Shaun White won his third gold in the halfpipe. His third run was nearly flawless, and included a frontside double cork 1440 followed by a cab double cork 1440. Trust us, that’s really hard.  Halfpipe skiers are judged on the number of turns, snowboarders are judged on the number of rotations. So these athletes don’t need to just get themselves in the air. To win, they need to stay there for as long as they can to complete their run. Canada’s Cassie Sharpe won the gold medal in the ski halfpipe with a run that included back-to-back 900s and a cork 1080. For a figure skater to earn a spot on the podium, they need to rise above the ice. Each jump is worth a certain number of points based on the degree of difficultly, and judges frequently watch slow motion replays of routines to make sure rotations are properly noted.  Japanese gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu performed quad salchows and quad toe loops, earning his second consecutive gold medal.  Russian gold medalist Alina Zagitova successfully landed a triple lutz — triple loop combination in both her short and long program.  No one can compete with the airborne speed of downhill skiers at the Olympics. To reach the bottom of the hill first, they must navigate jumps quickly and smoothly. That means being airborne at some 80 miles per hour and landing safely, only to make a turn and do it again.  Advertisement",2453

Here’s a look at what happened: The last 15 minutes of the ceremony were listed as an electronic dance music party. The DJs cranking loud music included Raiden (not the Mortal Kombat character), and Martin Garrix, the Dutch superstar of the scene. The athletes streamed out of the stands onto the floor and many of them danced. The American skiing superstar Lindsey Vonn led a conga line. A fun and unregimented way to end things. That wraps up the closing ceremony, and the 2018 Winter Olympics. Annyeong from Pyeongchang! Did you like the 2018 mascot, Soohorang? Here are 10 of him. The five children who starred at the opening ceremony also turned up for a cameo. They opened up a giant present that revealed a snow globe. Sports scenes were projected, an advertisement for the I.O.C.’s Olympics Channel. In the next segment, 400 performers entered carrying LED balls. Lights cascaded up to the Olympic flame and “extinguished” it. The performers took the shape of a snowflake to complete the effect. You think CL is big? Try the earth-shaking popular boy band Exo. The large group hit the stage with some slick dance moves and K-poppery to the delight of teenagers everywhere, including figure skating silver medalist Evgenia Medvedeva of Russia, who is a self-proclaimed Exo fan. And … speeches. Eight minutes of speeches. Lee Hee-beom, president of the organizing committee, and Thomas Bach, Olympic champion in fencing (mentioned for the third time). Bach spoke directly to North and South Korea. “You have shown how sport brings people together in our very fragile world, you have shown how sport builds bridges.” As a little thrill to shake up the torpor of the speeches, several well-known athletes, including Lindsey Vonn and Pita Taufatofua, the Tongan taekwondo Olympian who competed in cross-country skiing and appeared shirtless and well-oiled for the fourth consecutive Olympic ceremony, posed with Bach and made a heart gesture with their hands. Skaters scooted around the stage leaving luminescent trails that formed patterns, and eventually the logo of the 2022 Games. Giant illuminated pandas roller-bladed around. And then, at least according to the guidebook, the pandas flew back to Beijing through the internet. Time for K-pop! CL sang the pseudo hip-hop song “The Baddest Female” and “I Am the Best,” with torches and dancers. The crowd hit its highest level of excitement so far. And then some ritual. The national anthem of Greece. The flag of Greece was raised. The Olympic anthem. The Olympic flag was lowered and handed over to the mayor of Beijing, host of the 2022 Games. The national anthem of China. And that meant it was time for a segment devoted to Beijing. Yes, with pandas! Next a somewhat abstract look at time. Some base 60 numbers were projected. It was a bit hard to understand, but the ceremony guidebook clarified: “When the number becomes zero, the people of the future break free from the existing time and space, and arrive at a world no longer bound by gravity.” And “The Axis of New Time set a new orbit of time in motion, and despite the fluid nature of the orbit, it reformulates itself by discovering and creating a new order.” Thousands of moving lights and dancers made for a fine visual spectacle if not a crystal clear one. Traditionally a victory ceremony or two is held at the closing ceremony. Here it was the men’s and women’s mass start cross-country races. Marit Bjoergen of Norway accepted her mind-boggling eighth gold medal and Iivo Niskanen of Finland his second. Thomas Bach of the IOC was on hand and was introduced for a second time as a former fencing gold medalist. In English and French. In French, fencing is “escrime.” Rather than carrying the unified flag that was seen throughout the Games, South and North Korea each carried in their own flag: speedskater Lee Seung-hoon carried South Korea, and Kim Ju-sik of pairs figure skating, carried North Korea. On the stage, a mournful and reflective moment; a tribute to those who have died, led by a turtle and giant puppets. The puppets were kkoktu, used at funerals to guide the dead to the next world. Marchers carried dandelion seeds, symbolic of life arising from death. Turtles are said to carry messages from humans to the gods. Next up was the parade of flags, with each nation carried by one of its own Olympic heroes. Except for Russia, whose flag has been banner non grata at the Games. Ester Ledecka (Czech Republic), Jessie Diggins (U.S.), Marit Bjoergen (Norway), Ireen Wust (Netherlands) and Javier Fernandez (Spain) are among those who earned the honor. And then came the mass of athletes, entering in no particular order rather than strictly by nation as in the closing ceremony. This entry was scheduled to take 20 minutes, although at other Olympics it has often gone on much longer. There were a record 2,920 athletes at these Games. The Canadian delegation marched in on a high, with many athletes wearing their medals around their necks. They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever — winning 29 medals in total, 11 gold. You’ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes — and most of the biggest name athletes — travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony. So if you see any athletes limping just a little, they may have participated in this afternoon’s 30 kilometer cross-country skiing race. Jang Sa-ik and a group of children got the South Korean national anthem assignment. The anthem was accompanied not by an orchestra but by a single marimba, a xylophone-like instrument. And then Yang Tae-Hwan, 13, completely shredded Vivaldi’s the Four Seasons (Winter, naturally) in a rock guitar arrangement, as performers in glowing suits cavorted. Eighty traditional Korean instruments, geomungos, a kind of zither, were then mixed with the rock — the meeting of old and new. A prayer pagoda rose from the stage to cap the opening number. In a colorful intro, young skiers and skaters on wheels dashed onto the circular stage that filled the pentagonal stadium. There was heavy use of light projections on the stage. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Thomas Bach of the I.O.C. arrived and shook hands with Ivanka Trump among others. They were presented with snow globes by two children. Their significance? They were each born on July 7, 2011, the day Pyeongchang was awarded the Games. It was 35 degrees in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium. That’s tropical compared to the low teens from the opening ceremony here. Attendees were still given a bag with a seat warmers, hand warmers and toe warmers. The ceremony is expected to be two hours long, after all.",6879
5a9259c6410cf7000162dd4b,2018-02-25T06:37:53+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/sports/olympics/womens-curling-south-korea-garlic-girls.html,Sports,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea — The fans at Gangneung Curling Arena stood and waved South Korean flags and handmade signs in a salute to their women’s curling team and their unexpectedly strong showing at the Games. The final between South Korea and Sweden already was something like a “Miracle on Ice” moment, a sporting event that felt like a national pride rally for South Koreans. By the time they outlasted Japan in an emotionally draining semifinal, the South Korean curlers, called the “Garlic Girls” in the local news media for their pluck and origins in a garlic-growing region, had inspired scores of online tributes from compatriots mimicking them by sweeping the floor with broomsticks in front of their televisions. But they would not get their miracle on ice. The South Koreans succumbed to a more experienced, more skilled Swedish team, 8-3, in a match that was conceded before the 10th and final end. Sweden was making its fourth consecutive appearance in the final. It had won in 2006 and 2010 and earned the silver, behind Canada, in the 2014 Sochi Games. This year’s team included one holdover, Agnes Knochenhauer, from the Sochi squad, and she said the pressure that she and her teammates faced in this tournament came from within. “We really wanted to do this,” she said, “and we knew we could if all of us played really well.” The South Koreans faced external pressure to put on a good show in front of their home crowd. They fielded a completely different squad from 2014, when the country made its Olympic debut in the event. Four of the five team members attended high school in Uiseong, roughly 80 miles south of Pyeongchang. The city is the nation’s curling center but also its garlic capital. Although the “Garlic Girls” nickname follows them everywhere, the homemade signs ringing the arena gave voice to the team members’ preferred moniker: Team Kim, a reference to the fact that the four starters, the alternate and their coach share that surname (two of the athletes, Kim Kyeong-Ae and Kim Yeong-Mi, are sisters). The South Korean curlers came across as having a closeness and a camaraderie that was enviable. But in their news conference after the loss, there were hints of the hardships they have endured on their way to becoming Olympic darlings. The coach, Kim Min-jung, became emotional, stopping at one point to compose herself, while speaking of the “issues” they had to overcome. “It was very hard for me to lead the team properly because the Olympic Games could be the only chance for the team members,” she said through an interpreter. “So we had to resolve the issues within ourselves.” Asked to elaborate, she said through an interpreter that the country really only got behind curling in 2014, and because it remains less popular than other sports, it has been difficult to obtain the resources to properly develop athletes. As the words rushed out of Kim Min-jung, the curlers sat next to her on the podium, stone-faced. The news conference, which began with the moderator announcing that the curlers would not answer “political or sensitive questions,” contained a few lighthearted moments. Kim Eun-jung, 27, the team skip, essentially a captain on the ice, explained that “Eun” means silver in Korean. So maybe, she said with a laugh, she should change her name to “Geum-Jung because geum means gold.” But then her tone changed. She said the team went through “a lot in order to be successful.” The curlers’ somber expressions throughout most of the news conference gave the impression the silver medals hung heavy around their necks. Their expressions brightened when they left the interview tent and were greeted by men in police bibs and volunteers who clapped and took photographs. “It was our first time ever to really curl in front of a big audience,” said Kim Seon-Yeong. “All I can say is ‘Thank you so much.’”",3859
5a921e04410cf7000162dd02,2018-02-25T02:22:54+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/sports/olympics-russia-closing-ceremony-ban.html,Sports,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — The International Olympic Committee has upheld its suspension of Russia as a team from the Games, a move that will force the country’s athletes to march in the closing ceremony without their national colors or flag. The decision, in a unanimous vote here Sunday, came after two failed drug tests by Russian athletes — among nearly 170 competing here under a special dispensation — and after a long night of talks among senior I.O.C. officials. Russia’s Olympic committee was banned in December after revelations of one of the most sophisticated doping programs in sports history, including an elaborate scheme at the 2014 Sochi Games in Russia. The I.O.C. will consider reinstating the Russian committee if all remaining drug tests for its athletes at the Pyeongchang Games come back clean. Nicole Hoevertsz, the leader of the I.O.C.’s panel reviewing Russia’s compliance, said Russia could be reinstated within the next week. The I.O.C. decision came after protracted discussion over two days. “We should draw a line, we have to draw a line and look to the future,” Hoevertsz said. Russia’s final doping test results are anticipated within 72 hours, and if they are clean, the country will be restored to the I.O.C. in early March, Hoevertsz said. With the vote, the I.O.C.’s membership rubber-stamped a recommendation from its executive board. That group failed to reach common ground at a meeting on Saturday. The Bach-led executive board asked the review panel to change a part of its report late Saturday. The report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the Russian Olympic Committee. Two investigations revealed that Russia’s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years. Many of Russia’s top athletes were linked to the scandal and barred from the Games. Alina Zagitova, a 15-year-old figure skater, was the only Russian to have won a gold medal in Pyeongchang by the time the committee voted. The men’s hockey team won a second gold on Sunday, defeating Germany. The Russians will now leave the Olympics the way they entered: in neutral uniforms that provided a constant reminder of the damage done to Russia’s sporting reputation by the scheme, a state-controlled effort to replace drug-tainted urine samples with clean ones, according to the investigations. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other top sports officials from the country have denied that the doping program reached the highest levels of their government. The effects of the scandal have disrupted the last two Games, shifting attention from athletics to litigation. Before the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where Russia participated as a nation while some of its athletes were banned because of the scandal, the country tried to use the sports courts to increase its number of participants. It made a similar effort in the final days leading up to these Winter Olympics. Both attempts were unsuccessful. A Russian delegation that included Evgenia Medvedeva, the silver medalist in women’s figure skating, made a presentation to the executive board. The bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva’s positive drug test the day before did not help Russia’s cause. She was the second Russian to fail a drug test here. When the I.O.C. banned Russia on Dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country’s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations. Russia was also required to pay a $15 million fine. “This is not a decision everyone will be happy with,” Hoevertsz said after Sunday’s vote. “We will be criticized.” The decision to potentially reinstate Russia met skepticism on Sunday, with critics pointing to retests of doping samples conducted years after the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In those tests, Russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both Games, according to the I.O.C.’s own statistics (18 out of 65 from Beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from London 2012) “If the retests shows the result then the I.O.C will take the appropriate measures,” Bach said at a news conference Sunday afternoon, without elaborating. Richard Pound, the I.O.C.’s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of Russia. Adam Pengilly, a British member who also has been critical of the I.O.C.’s reaction to the Russia scandal, was sent home from the Games after an altercation with a security guard. After being warned that their conduct would affect the I.O.C.’s decision, Russian athletes have largely been keeping a low profile in South Korea. They have generally stayed off social media and refrained from making critical comments or displaying nationalistic symbols. The two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme, the panel said. Russia’s I.O.C. member, Shamil Tarpischev, said “a lack of cultural education” was to blame. Russia will be welcomed back as a full-fledged Olympic nation if all of its remaining drugs tests from the Pyeongchang Games are negative. Then the I.O.C. can try to move on from one of the biggest scandals in Olympics history. Athletes from around the world have been among the most critical voices opposing Russia’s return. On Saturday, American biathletes joined others to say they wouldn’t participate in a season-ending event in Russia. “We believe this should be the end of this big problem and pave the way for a new chapter in Olympic sport,” Tarpischev said.",5526
5a91df9a410cf7000162dcbf,2018-02-24T21:56:37+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/sports/olympics-motherhood-randall-gold-medal.html,Sports,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — When Kikkan Randall and Marit Bjorgen shared the Olympic podium after the women’s team sprint freestyle, it was a significant moment for their sport. It was also a great moment for mothers. First the significance. Randall, 35, and her teammate Jessie Diggins became the first American cross-country skiers to win a gold medal, and the first from the United States to get any kind of medal at the Olympics since Bill Koch won silver in 1976. And Norway’s Bjorgen, 37, won bronze to become the most decorated winter athlete, with 14 Olympic medals, including five in Pyeongchang. (After the winning the 30-kilometer race Sunday, she finished the Games with two gold, a silver and two bronze.) Both women are also relatively new mothers. Randall’s son, Breck, will be 2 in April. She is the only mother on Team U.S.A., which has 20 fathers. Bjorgen’s son, Marius, turned 2 in December. Motherhood presents a challenge for any woman trying to juggle work and family, but it is an intense physical and logistical challenge for elite cross-country skiers — several hours a day of grueling training, extra sleep requirements and a brutal travel schedule across six or seven European countries from November through April. Women’s cross-country skiing experienced something of a baby boom about two years ago. Seven elite ski racers on the World Cup circuit, including Bjorgen and Randall, have toddlers now — and all had babies within about six months of one another in late 2015 and in 2016. It’s not a coincidence that the top women in the sport gave birth in the same window. With world championships in odd-numbered years and an Olympics every fourth even-numbered year, 2016 was essentially a gap year in cross-country racing — a year without either international event. Which made it a good time to start a family. After their pregnancies, Randall and her fellow competitors shared parenting advice about sleep training and getting back into shape. It seems to have worked. Two of the women ended up on top of an Olympic podium at these Games and two more came close. They also worked together to persuade the International Ski Federation to support them. Randall and Finland’s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms — stocked with diapers and toys — that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events. “Men can have families, and they don’t ever have to miss a single race,” said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. “Knowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. It’s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.” While those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in Europe and didn’t face the same challenges Randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates. Their buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation. Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season. “We made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn’t want to be disruptive to the athletes,” Randall said. “Kids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.” After talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules — sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. Randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up. There were bumps in the road. It took a month for Breck to adjust to the time difference in Europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. And it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. “There was a lot of gear,” Randall said. The toughest part was dividing her time between the needs of her family and her own desire to be with her team. “How do I be the best mom and best athlete? That part I hadn’t anticipated,” she said. Her teammate Diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn’t always be ideal. Sometimes the Americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear Breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in Park City, Utah. But Diggins said the team didn’t want Randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. “Women shouldn’t have to choose,” Diggins said. “This team only works when everyone buys in.” And there were benefits to having Breck along for the ride, said Sadie Bjornsen, another team member. Bjornsen, who calls herself a “sucker for kids,” said playing with Breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour. “Sometimes I will come in after a race and be bummed out about how I’ve done, and I’ll just go over and hug Breck, and it will make me feel better,” she said. Randall, who plans to retire after this Olympics, recently won election to the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission. She hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other Olympic families. In the end, she did not bring her son to the Olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. Instead, Breck stayed in Toronto with her husband’s parents, and the separation was painful, said Randall. She said she wanted to work with the I.O.C. to create affordable housing for family members at future Olympics. She hopes that seeing women like herself and Bjorgen on the Olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn’t have to choose between an Olympic medal and motherhood. In fact, she asserted, the two can work well together. She recalled sharing a moment with Bjorgen when they were each presented a stuffed white Soohorang tiger, the Olympic mascot, during the podium ceremony. They looked at each other with a knowing laugh. “I said, ‘Well, this is for Breck,’ and she said, ‘This is for Marius.’ ”",6809
5a91d273410cf7000162dcad,2018-02-24T21:00:28+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/sports/hockey/new-york-rangers-jean-ratelle.html,Sports,"Jean Ratelle last played for the Rangers in 1975, but his smooth-skating style and gentlemanly demeanor have never been far from the consciousness of the team’s fans. A center, Ratelle joined the team in the early 1960s and was a linemate of a fellow Hall of Famer, Rod Gilbert. They formed the Goal-a-Game, or GAG, line with left wing Vic Hadfield, one of franchise’s most famous trios. Each had a chance at 50 goals in 1971-72 before Ratelle broke an ankle late in the season. The linemates will reunite at Madison Square Garden on Sunday as Ratelle’s No. 19 joins the numbers of other franchise luminaries in the rafters before the Rangers’ game against the Detroit Red Wings. “Glen called me and said, ‘Jean, we’d like to retire your sweater,’” said Ratelle, referring to the Rangers’ president, Glen Sather, who also was his teammate in New York. “I said, ‘Glen, it would be a great honor.’” Ratelle, now 77, played parts of 16 seasons for the Rangers before a stunning trade on Nov. 7, 1975, when he and defensemen Brad Park and Joe Zanussi were sent to the Boston Bruins for Phil Esposito and Carol Vadnais. The trade came a week after the Rangers had waived the popular goaltender Eddie Giacomin, who returned two days later in goal for the Red Wings when Ratelle played his last home game as a Ranger. The seismic roster shift sent shock waves through the fan base. The Ratelle trade was even on the front page of The New York Times. (By coincidence, the Rangers, who have said they are planning to rebuild, will be honoring Ratelle the day before the trading deadline.) Ratelle, 35 at the time, went on to play six seasons with the Bruins, for whom he wore No. 10. His time in Boston included trips to the Stanley Cup finals in 1977 and 1978 before he retired at 40 in 1981. Ratelle finished his career with 491 goals and continued to work for the Bruins for another two decades, first as an assistant coach, then as a scout. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985. “I felt loyalty to the Bruins,” he said. “I was with them for 26 years.” Ratelle developed a bond with Jeff Gorton, the Rangers’ general manager, who spent 15 years in the Bruins’ front office before joining the Rangers in 2007. “I used to go to high school and college games with him,” Gorton said. “I remember those times. You look at his numbers, everything he’s accomplished, and you look up to the rafters knowing Jean Ratelle belongs there.” Ratelle will be the ninth Rangers player to have his number honored, joining Giacomin (1), Gilbert (7), Harry Howell (3), Andy Bathgate (9), Mark Messier (11), Mike Richter (35), Brian Leetch (2) and Adam Graves, whose No. 9 hangs next to Bathgate’s. “It’s just the right time,” Ratelle said. He will be joined on Sunday by his wife, Nancy, their three daughters and their families. “My wife and I were watching a Rangers game last winter, and they were talking about the players with their sweaters retired,” said Ratelle, whose No. 19 was worn most recently by Jesper Fast until he switched to No. 17 this season. “She said, ‘The Rangers should really retire your sweater because you had a great career in New York.’ ‘O.K.,’ I said. ‘If Glen calls me, I will say yes.’ A month later, he called.” Ratelle will be on the ice with other former teammates, including Park, Giacomin, goaltender Gilles Villemure and forward Pete Stemkowski. “Jean didn’t say much,” said Stemkowski, who played seven seasons with the Rangers. “He wasn’t a rah-rah guy, and I don’t think I ever heard him swear. He just worked hard at his craft.” Also expected to partake in the festivities will be Ratelle’s longtime coach and general manager, Emile Francis. He first coached Ratelle when he was a teenager playing for the Rangers’ junior team in Guelph, Ontario. “I couldn’t be happier for Jean,” said Francis, 91, who lives in Florida and remains close with his players from the GAG line era. “No doubt about it, he was one of the best players who ever played for me.” That group is synonymous with a glorious but unfulfilled Rangers era. The chance to stand together again on Garden ice is special. Hadfield, who became the first Ranger to score 50 goals in a season, on the last day of the 1971-72 season, was more enforcer than goal scorer throughout the 1960s, when the Rangers failed to win a single playoff series. Hadfield, who was born one day after Ratelle in October 1940, joined the Rangers in 1961-62 and stayed through the 1973-74 season, after which he was traded to Pittsburgh. Hadfield said what made Rangers teams of that era unique was the players’ closeness, exemplified by the mild-mannered yet intense Ratelle, whose 109 points in 1971-72 are second-most in franchise history (behind Jaromir Jagr’s 123 in 2005-06). “Jean was not only an excellent hockey player, but he was an excellent individual,” Hadfield said. “As a team, we all hung out together because we all lived on Long Island. We always had five or six guys and our wives together for dinner. That’s how it was. We won as a team and we lost as a team.” Gilbert played until 1977, finishing with 406 goals and 1,021 points, still franchise records. He has never left New York, and he works for the Rangers as director of special projects and community relations representative. He marvels at the happenstance that created a lifelong bond with Ratelle, who is from Lac Saint-Jean, Quebec. “It was pure luck we were brought together as kids in Montreal,” said Gilbert, a Montreal native. “Then we have this great career together through juniors and with the Rangers. And now we’re both in the Hall of Fame. It’s magical.” The Hall of Famer Yvan Cournoyer, who played against Ratelle throughout his career, said there was a parallel between Ratelle and the Montreal Canadiens great Jean Beliveau, Cournoyer’s longtime teammate. “Jean Ratelle had the same elegance and style as Jean Beliveau,” said Cournoyer, a 10-time Stanley Cup winner with the Canadiens. “And he was a gentleman off the ice. What is too bad is that Jean Ratelle never won a Stanley Cup. But the Rangers were a team we respected because of Jean and Rod and all their guys.” In 1971-72, Ratelle and his linemates were on pace to break all sorts of records and possibly lead the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup since 1940. But in early March, Ratelle’s ankle was fractured by a shot taken by his teammate Dale Rolfe, and he was not a factor in the playoffs. The Rangers beat Montreal in six games, then swept Chicago to set up a showdown against Bobby Orr and the Bruins in the finals. Ratelle had only one assist in six games as the Rangers lost to the Bruins, who lifted the Cup at the Garden that May 11. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist, whose No. 30 will surely take its place above the Garden ice one day, said he had enjoyed visiting with the greats of yesteryear. Ratelle and his linemates attended the team’s preseason golf outing last September. “They are all super nice and funny, those guys, and you can see they care for each other,” Lundqvist said. “It was a different time that’s for sure — a different game and a different approach. But it looks like they always had fun.” For Rangers followers of his era, the chance to honor Ratelle feels like a long-overdue welcome-home party. “Time goes by,” Ratelle said. “It will be nice to be with the guys. This will be very special for me because we had some great teams in New York. And there’s only one New York.”",7440

The American medal haul, led by Bode Miller, was twice the amount of any other nation. At the time, the team’s rallying cry was “Best in the World.” The European ski racing establishment occasionally mocked that mission statement. But not in 2010. The Americans were a force. Four years later at the Sochi Games, five Alpine athletes from the United States team — three men and two women — won five medals. There were two American Olympic champions. At the Pyeongchang Olympics, American skiers combined to win a gold, a silver and a bronze, and all of it stemmed from the efforts of only two racers. Mikaela Shiffrin won the women’s giant slalom and was second in the Alpine combined. Lindsey Vonn claimed a bronze in the downhill.  Vonn, 33, now expects to retire from the sport after the next World Cup season. Asked to look ahead to the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the oft-injured Vonn smiled on Thursday and said, “My body can’t take four more years.” That leaves the 22-year-old Shiffrin, who could compete in two or three more Winter Olympics. Shiffrin may yet be a transcendent talent who sets a host of Olympic medal records, but is anyone else in the American ski racing community going to rise up and give her a hand? In the last two weeks here, besides Vonn and Shiffrin, there were women on the United States team who showed promise. In the women’s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin. And another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month. But on the men’s side, things were more bleak. Perhaps symbolically, Ted Ligety, one of three Americans to win two Alpine gold medals, watched his Olympic career probably come to a close with a disappointing 15th in his signature event, the giant slalom. Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men’s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined. Still, Ligety’s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here. That’s a long way from the eight medals the Olympic men’s team won at the 2010 Vancouver Games. “We don’t have all cylinders firing, but that doesn’t mean we can’t turn it around in a two- to four-year cycle,” said Tiger Shaw, the chief executive of U.S. Ski and Snowboard, the umbrella group overseeing the ski team. “We have a lot of young talent. I think you need to look at potential, and when I look at the potential, I’m not worried.” It is true that there were flashes of an improved future for the American men. Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career. Cochran-Siegle was also 14th in the super-G. Bryce Bennett, another Olympic rookie and an intriguing prospect because he is 6 feet 7 inches, was 16th in the downhill and 17th in the Alpine combined. Bennett and Cochran-Siegle are each 25 years old. Buried for now deep on the United States ski team’s roster are other American men with impressive junior racing pedigrees who were simply too untested on the World Cup level to qualify for the trip to Pyeongchang. Included in that group is River Radamus, the son of two high-level, Colorado-based, ski racing coaches. Radamus, 19, has been near the top of the overall standings on what amounts to ski racing’s minor league circuit for most of this winter. In 2017, at the Youth Olympic Games, Radamus won three races, which was unprecedented at the event. Two years older than Radamus is his teammate Sam Morse, who won the downhill at the junior world championships last year (Merryweather won the women’s downhill). Morse, raised in Maine, not only believes better days are coming for the American men, he believes the new wave of racers will introduce pioneering techniques because it is the first generation to have spent its entire upbringing using shaped skis, which, because of their parabolic silhouettes, are easier to turn. “It’s a different style coming up, more arcing of turns and less sliding,” Morse said late last year. Morse added: “And when we come up, it won’t just be one or two fast guys but a whole squad.” If so, Shiffrin will appreciate the reinforcements.",5056
5a9145d6410cf7000162dbdd,2018-02-24T11:00:30+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/sports/usa-swimming-resignations.html,Sports,"Two top U.S.A. Swimming officials, including one whose job was specifically to protect athletes, have resigned after a series of scathing reports alleging that the organization had ignored sexual abuse by coaches for years while athletes suffered. The officials, Susan Woessner — the organization’s Safe Sport senior director — and Pat Hogan, its club development managing director, announced their departures on Thursday in letters posted online. A statement and letter posted by U.S.A. Swimming described an apparent conflict of interest involving Ms. Woessner, who, until recently, had not disclosed that she had kissed a coach before later being asked to assist in an investigation into whether that coach had become romantically involved with a 21-year-old swimmer. The reason for Mr. Hogan’s resignation was not as clear, and U.S.A. Swimming did not say whether the two officials had been forced out or had resigned voluntarily. “I assure you that this organization is facing this extremely serious issue with one very clear goal — protecting children and athletes,” Tim Hinchey III, the president and chief executive of U.S.A. Swimming, said in a letter to members. “Every day we work hard to get better as an organization. We are never complacent. We want to listen and to hear from you.” U.S.A. Swimming, the national governing body for the sport in the United States, is now engulfed in a scandal similar to the one that has upended U.S.A. Gymnastics. That scandal led to a team doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, pleading guilty to sexually abusing girls and set off a congressional investigation. In the weeks after Dr. Nassar’s dramatic sentencing, an Olympic swimmer, Ariana Kukors, accused her former coach of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. The coach, Sean Hutchison, denied the allegations, saying that the pair had a “committed relationship” that began after she was of age. Then, this month, The Orange County Register published an article of almost 7,500 words alleging that U.S.A. Swimming executives were aware of sexually predatory coaches for years, but that they did not take action against them or try to change the organization’s permissive culture. Ms. Woessner was among the officials accused in the Register report of choosing not to pursue sexual abuse cases against coaches even after being presented with direct complaints. In her resignation letter, Ms. Woessner acknowledged that in 2007, during her first stint working with U.S.A. Swimming — as a database coordinator — she “engaged in kissing on a single occasion” with Mr. Hutchison, who was then a coach. She left the organization later that year to pursue a master’s degree in social work, and then returned to U.S.A. Swimming in 2010, when she was named the organization’s athlete protection officer. In that role, Ms. Woessner wrote, she was asked to assist in an investigation into whether Mr. Hutchison was romantically involved with “a 21-year-old athlete member.” (U.S.A. Swimming has said it became aware of a rumored relationship between Mr. Hutchison and Ms. Kukors in 2010, when Ms. Kukors was 21.) In her resignation letter, Ms. Woessner said she had never had sex with Mr. Hutchison and “never had a sexual or romantic relationship of any kind at any time” with him. (A lawyer for Mr. Hutchison did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment on Friday night.) Still, in a news release announcing Ms. Woessner’s resignation, U.S.A. Swimming said she had recently provided the organization with information about the “personal interaction.” Her behavior didn’t break any rules until she took the job as the athlete protection officer, the statement said. But the statement added that “considering Woessner’s Safe Sport role,” she should have disclosed her interaction with Mr. Hutchison before taking part in the investigation into his behavior. Ms. Woessner did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on Friday night. Mr. Hogan, who served in his role at U.S.A. Swimming for 15 years, became romantically involved with Julie Ginden, one of his teenage swimmers in Atlanta, in the 1980s. They married when she was 20, and have since divorced. “I conducted myself with complete honor and integrity in my relationship with my former wife,” Mr. Hogan told The New York Times in 2010. “Our relationship, which developed after she was 18 and I was a young man in my 20s, always had the full knowledge and blessing of her parents.” The reason for Mr. Hogan’s resignation was not clear. Efforts to reach Mr. Hogan on Friday night were unsuccessful. In an email sent on Monday to Mr. Hinchey, B. Robert Allard, a lawyer for Ms. Kukors, demanded that the U.S.A. Swimming chief fire Ms. Woessner and Mr. Hogan by Feb. 28. “If you fail to meet this demand, we will assume that you stand by these two people and back up everything that they said and did in the past,” Mr. Allard wrote in the email. “I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt. Now is the time to show your true colors.” Asked for comment late Friday, Isabelle McLemore, a spokeswoman for U.S.A. Swimming, said, “At this time our statements stand as our comments on these matters.” In his letter to members, Mr. Hinchey noted the “recent media coverage,” and emphasized that the organization “does not tolerate sexual abuse or misconduct.” “We will not shy away from acknowledging or supporting survivors of abuse, and we will strive to ensure that there is never a lapse of a support system again,” the statement said. “While we disagree on several of the reported statements and many of the conclusions in recent media reports, members were failed, and we are doing everything we can to make sure it never happens again.”",5723

She also won the gold medal in super-G. But no matter how impressive her accomplishments, she has a way to go to surpass Walter Winans, a forgotten American Olympian who was one of the great renaissance men of his time. Winans won a gold medal in shooting in London in 1908, then won a silver in Stockholm in 1912. But he also won a gold medal that year in a different event entirely. Sculpture. Yes, the Olympics held art competitions from 1912 to 1948. The categories included architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture. The art competitions were no sideshow, but a serious part of the Olympics program. Igor Stravinsky was even recruited as a judge for the 1924 music competition in Paris. (He stingily awarded no gold, silver or bronze medals.) Winans’s winning sculpture, “An American Trotter,” beat out a strong field of eight that included silver medalist Georges Dubois, a French hurdler, who entered the seemingly more appropriate “Model of the Entrance to a Modern Stadium.” Also in the field was Prince Paolo Trubetskoy of Russia, a friend of Tolstoy, and Rembrandt Bugatti of Italy, younger brother of the car manufacturer. Winans is the only person to win gold in a sport and an art. Alfred Hajos won two gold medals in swimming in 1896, in the 100 and 1,200 meter freestyle, then turned up in 1924 seeking architecture gold. But his design for a sports stadium could only muster a silver. Winans was to the manner born, grandson of Ross Winans, a railroad builder, and was descended from Count Goswyn de Wynants, chief counselor to Charles VI of Brabant. Winans grew up in Russia, where his father was building the Moscow and St. Petersburg Railroad. He never really worked — his New York Times obituary delicately refers to a “lack of interest in business” — but devoted his life, lived mostly in Europe, and his ample inherited resources, to athletics and the arts. Winans was an author as well, churning out books on shooting, sculpting and horses. They included “How to Drive a Trotter,” “Deer Breeding for Fine Heads” and “Shooting for Ladies.” As a marksman, he won 12 straight British revolver championships, and he took a prize in Vienna for a display of 60 heads of big game animals, out of 2,000 he had killed. Winans did not just sculpt trotters, he also showed and raced them. He was inducted into the Harness Racing Hall of Fame (as an “immortal”) in 1981. And he died as you might imagine he wished. At 68, he hopped into the sulky for a trotting race at Parsloes Park in London. Just before the finish, the two-time Olympic gold medalist dropped the reins on his horse, Henrietta Guy, slipped out of his seat and fell dead. But not until he had crossed the finish line.",2919
5a9137b2410cf7000162dbc6,2018-02-24T10:00:13+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/sports/olympics/final-medal-count-norway.html,Sports,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Surpassing its own lofty expectations, Norway has delivered the greatest performance in the history of the Winter Games, winning a total of 39 medals, 14 of them gold. A nation of only five million people has crushed all comers, including sports behemoths like Germany and the United States, in the events Norwegians care about the most. Elsewhere, these historic results would yield the kind of street parties where strangers high-five one another until their hands hurt. In Norway, celebrations have been far more subdued. The most raucous it has gotten so far is a lot of joyful shouting at the television. “We always want to win,” said Fredrik Aukland, a TV sports commentator in Norway. “But modesty is a big part of the culture here. And Norwegians don’t go out much.” Unless it’s Constitution Day, ostentatious displays of all kinds are frowned upon in Norway, especially when it comes to wealth, a notable feature in one of the world’s richest countries. Nobody expects a parade for returning athletes, even though they are bringing home 14 medals in cross-country, six in biathlon, five in ski jumping, seven in Alpine skiing and four in speedskating. The haul is sure to revive pangs of concern that have shadowed Norway’s streak of victories in recent years — that the country may dominate some winter sports so thoroughly that it is ruining them. That anxiety is strongest in cross-country skiing, which is adored with a fervor that stretches back centuries. Norwegians fear lopsided results can demolish enthusiasm for a sport in countries that are getting demolished. Justyna Kowalczyk, an Olympic athlete from Poland who competed in Pyeongchang, calls it a paradox. Norway may love cross-country to death. “It’s wonderful that they have a big budget, big sponsors and that everyone in Norway loves skiing,” Kowalczyk, who has won five Olympic medals, said in a telephone interview. “But that makes it really difficult for countries like Poland to compete.” It isn’t unusual for one country to own a sport, at least for a while. The Netherlands does it in speedskating, the United States in basketball. The difference is that Norwegians say they desperately want cross-country skiing to gain a large, sustained following around the world, and that means nurturing an audience on television. Cross-country races are televised every weekend, from November to mid-April, to large swaths of Europe. Ratings in different nations rise when homegrown contenders are in the mix and shrink when they are not. Since 2011, when Norway’s ascendant era began, viewership figures have dwindled by about 40 percent, said Jurg Capol, the marketing director of the International Ski Federation. “If the athlete from your country keeps finishing in 23rd place, you’re less likely to see the race in your country,” he said. “It’s all about results.” To thrive, cross-country needs national heroes in places like Germany, which has a population of more than 82 million. And while the United States, Sweden and other countries have lately won some major titles, the Norwegians took gold at all five of the women’s events at the world championships in Finland last year, and won a total of 18 medals, more than any other country. Norway won 15 in cross-country. The next-closest country won four. All of this presents a conundrum for Norwegians. They want their athletes to destroy everyone in their favorite sport, but the sport could be destroyed unless other countries win. A similar tension is built into Norway’s fortune, which comes from vast oil reserves and has turned the nation’s sovereign wealth fund into the largest in the world. Norwegians are green to the core, and when it comes to their own energy needs, they are huge fans of the clean, renewable variety. They also pocket billions from fossil fuels. A surfeit of gold and oil — bigger problems have plagued nations. But Norway is not going to stop drilling, and it certainly won’t handicap its cross-country athletes. “It’s a strange thing, but some people in Norway yell at us when we win too much,” said Knut Nystad, who heads the team’s 30-person wax tech operation. “Other countries dominate other sports. Why is the argument against success made only in the sport where we’re succeeding?” Instead of holding back its athletes, Norway is trying to lift others everywhere else. It has conceived the Alpine athletics version of the Marshall Plan. For seven years, it has invited competitors from all over the world to visit for a weeklong training camp. A separate camp is offered to World Cup coaches. Attendees pay to get there, and Norway covers all other expenses. “We show them what works for us,” said Erik Roste, president of the Norwegian Ski Federation. “We don’t have the blueprint, but we feel a responsibility to the international community, and we want to be open. We want to share our knowledge.” Of course, one week in Norway will not suffice. The country’s pre-eminence stems from a long list of factors, only a few of which could be reproduced anywhere else. The most elusive is culturally embedded. In a sparsely populated nation covered with snow, a pair of skis has been indispensable, and countless children start to learn as toddlers. This helps explain why the breadth and depth of passion for the sport has few parallels. Love for cross-country became an essential national trait, one that any ingratiating foreigner has to embrace. Even royalty. When Norway voted to break its union with Sweden in 1905, it recruited the son of Denmark’s king to serve as monarch. The new king was given an invaluable piece of advice by a famous Norwegian adventurer. “Fridtjof Nansen told King Haakon that he didn’t need to learn the language to win the hearts of Norwegians,” Roste said. “He needed to learn to ski. And he did.” Then there is Norway’s abiding infatuation with its lush natural surroundings. People have such a deep bond with the landscape that there is a ubiquitous word for communing with it: friluftsliv, a.k.a. “open-air living.” The concept is so popular that NRK, the nation’s largest TV network, found a way for Norwegians to enjoy it indoors. In 2011, the network placed a camera on the front of a boat called the MS Nordnorge and ran live footage for 134 hours of nothing but nature, quietly passing by. Half of the country tuned in. The love for nature and skiing has given rise to some 1,000 ski clubs. Informal and low budget, many of them are driven by volunteers and overseen by parents. But they give the sport a vast and fertile grass-roots base. At this Olympics, one of Norway’s breakout stars has been the 21-year-old Johannes Klaebo, who emerged from Byasen Idrettslag, a club in the city of Trondheim, and won three cross-country gold medals. Nobody had heard of him a year and a half ago. “He could have been a great soccer player, he could have been great at any sport he chose,” said Aukland, the sports commentator for NRK. “He chose cross-country skiing because it’s the most popular.” Which is why, at the highest levels, the sport has sponsors like banks, oil companies and insurers. These deep-pocketed benefactors help fund research and development as well as expensive equipment. This includes a two-story, 1,100-square-foot waxing truck with a state-of-the art ventilation system. It cost $1 million. The combination of tradition, training and support is nearly impossible for other countries to match, which is why, here in Pyeongchang, when other countries won, Norwegian athletes occasionally sounded relieved to give up at least some of the spotlight. Marit Bjorgen became the winningest athlete in Winter Olympics history when she nabbed her 14th medal at the team sprint race. She took bronze. Gold went to the United States, and silver to Sweden. In an interview after the race, Bjorgen seemed sincerely pleased with the outcome. “Of course we were fighting for gold,” she said. “But it’s great to see the U.S. on the podium. It’s important for the sport.”",8011

The team made the announcement in a statement Saturday. It is the latest sign of discontent among athletes over the handling of the Russian doping scandal, which corrupted the 2014 Winter Olympics as well as scores of other events across several years. Russian officials were not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for the International Biathlon Union declined to comment. The International Olympic Committee’s executive board is meeting Saturday to determine whether to lift the suspension on Russia’s National Olympic Committee and allow its athletes to march with the Russian flag during Sunday’s closing ceremony for the Pyeongchang Games. Doping by Russian athletes infested biathlon for years. The revelations in 2016 unmasked the larger state-led doping program. Yet the I.B.U. has resisted calls to move events from the country, saying those decisions were made before the World Anti-Doping Agency declared Russia’s antidoping noncompliant. “The I.B.U.’s recent decision to move forward with the World Cup Final in Tyumen, Russia, is completely unacceptable,” the U.S. athletes said in a statement. Their decision follows a similar stand made by the Canadian team. Czech officials, cited by the French news agency Agence France-Presse, said their athletes would also boycott the event. Sweden’s Sebastian Samuelsson said his team was also poised to boycott events in Russia. Samuelsson won a silver medal in Pyeongchang last week. “The outcry from our fellow athletes from around the world has been respectful, strong and definitive. In addition to the dozens who expressed their opinion to the I.B.U. Athletes Committee members ahead of the meeting in January 2018, the I.B.U. received letters representing over 30 athletes, from eight countries, and included three 2018 Olympic Champions,” the American statement added. The International Olympic Committee itself has directed winter sports organizations like the I.B.U. to halt their preparations for competitions in Russia and seek alternative venues. For sports officials that have defied that guidance, the threat of boycott by global athletes has prompted them to move major events, including skiing, bobsled and skeleton competitions. The World Anti-Doping Agency has declared Russia’s drug testing authority noncompliant, a status it says it will maintain until Russia publicly accepts that there was a state-backed doping program and allows WADA officials full access to data from the main testing laboratory in Moscow. Russian biathletes were among scores of athletes barred from competing at the 2018 Games after an investigation into the doping conspiracy, which involved the state security apparatus clandestinely switching tainted urine samples for clean ones. The former I.O.C. President Jacques Rogge in 2011 was so concerned about the country’s biathlon federation that he urged Russia’s president at the time, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to take stronger action. Grigory Rodchenkov the former head of Russia’s doping laboratory, who became a whistle-blower, said in a sworn statement that billionaire Brooklyn Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov played a role in obscuring the scheme when he led the Russian Biathlon Union. Prokhorov, who denies the claim, is helping to financed a New York defamation suit against Rodchenkov by three banned biathletes. Several Russian athletes who won medals in Sochi were stripped of their awards after investigations tying them to the doping program. That has led to threats to competitors from other countries in line to receive the reallocated medals, including the Czech biathlon team that was told in November it would receive a silver originally won by Russia. Russia’s doping problems have overshadowed the participation of more than 160 of its athletes in Korea. They have participated under the I.O.C.’s flag and worn neutral uniforms, a condition of their entry into the Games. Two of the four athletes to fail drug tests here have been Russian, with the most recent failure coming Friday, on the eve of the critical I.O.C. meeting that will rule on the status of its banned Olympic Committee and what happens at the closing ceremony.",4422

South Korea’s “Garlic Girls” lost the curling gold medal match to Sweden, 8-3. Two steals in ends 4 and 5 gave Sweden a 5-1 lead that it did not relinquish. South Korea’s silver medal was its first in curling; it also won its first snowboard, bobsled and skeleton medals ever at these Games. “We did the game of the week when we needed it in an Olympic final,” said Swedish skip Anna Hasselborg. “I'm so proud of my girls. It was an amazing game to play. I'm overwhelmed with feelings. It's crazy.” Russia rallied from 3-2 down to Germany in the third period of the gold medal hockey match, scoring a short-handed goal with less than a minute left, then winning in overtime, 4-3. Nikita Gusev had two goals for Russia, known at these Games as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.” It was the first gold for Russian players in the event since 1992, when Russia played as the Unified Team. “Since I was five years old, when I started to play hockey, this was the dream of my late father; this was my dream,” said Ilya Kovalchuk, the tournament’s MVP. “I think we haven’t quite realized what we did. But no matter how often you said that it would be easy, that it’s a second-tier league, I think that today’s game put a lot of things back in their place. It showed that this is the Olympics.” The International Olympic Committee upheld its suspension of Russia as a team from the Games, a move that will force its athletes to march in the closing ceremony without their national colors or flag. The decision, in a vote here Sunday, came after two failed drug tests by Russian athletes — among more than 160 competing here under a special dispensation — and after a long night of talks among senior I.O.C. officials. Full coverage here. Flag bearers at the ceremony will include Jessica Diggins of the United States, Marit Bjoergen of Norway, Ester Ledecka of Czech Republic and Pita Taufatofua of Tonga. Marit Bjoergen of Norway powered away from the field and won the women’s mass start race by almost two minutes. It was the eighth gold medal and 15th medal overall for Bjoergen, 37. The eight gold medals equaled the record held by two other Norwegians, Ole Bjoerndalen in biathlon and Bjoern Daehlie in cross country. The 15 medals is the record. “When I look behind me and see what I have done, it's incredible,” Bjoergen said. “It has been an amazing career for me; this is my last Olympics and to finish like this is incredible.” Teresa Stadlober of Austria was in second place when she took a wrong turn, dropping her back to eighth. She finished ninth. Francesco Friedrich of Germany, driver of the winning two-man sled, added the gold medal in the four-man bob. A second German sled and South Korea tied for the silver. Germany won gold in all three bobsled events at the Games. It was Germany’s 14th gold medal at the Games, equaling a record set by Canada in Vancouver in 2010. Norway also won 14 golds at these Games. Nana Takagi of Japan and Seung-Hoon Lee of South Korea won the mass start speedskating races. New at these Olympics, mass start races are the only long-track events in which skaters all race at once. “As the first mass start, I feel very happy to do this in front of my home crowd and I am honored to get so much praise with this medal,” Lee said. Two members of the Canada’s Olympic delegation, an athlete and a manager, were arrested Friday in Pyeongchang, accused of stealing an idling car and driving drunk, a local police official and representative of Team Canada said Saturday. Lee In-ho, superintendent of the Gangwon Province Police, declined to name the athlete or manager but said the driver had a blood alcohol level of .160. Mr. Lee said that the pair jumped into the car and drove from Daegwalryong village in Pyeongchang to the athletes’ village, in Gangneung. It was not immediately clear whether the athlete or the manager drove the car. Reports in the Canadian and South Korean news media said the athlete was a 35-year-old skier who did not win a medal. Isabelle Charest, Canada’s chef de mission, confirmed there had been an incident involving a Canadian athlete but declined to provide further details. — MOTOKO RICH Sebastien Toutant of Canada won the men’s big air snowboard event, wrapping up the gold with an 84.75 and a competition-best 89.50 on his first two jumps. The American Kyle Mack was second, while Red Gerard, 17, who had won the slopestyle event earlier in the games, placed fifth.  In the crowd was Ivanka Trump taking in her first event of the Olympics with South Korean First Lady Kim Jung-sook. Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic won a gold medal in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom on Saturday, becoming the first woman to win a medal in two sports in a single Olympics. She had earlier won the skiing super-G. Nevin Galmarini of Switzerland won the men’s race.  “It was actually quite tough to change myself to a snowboarder. I had one week for it, in the end, and until yesterday I didn’t really feel good with my riding. But today I found the snowboarder in me, luckily.” Full coverage here. The American men won the country’s first gold medal in curling with a 10-7 victory against Sweden. John Shuster, a four-time Olympian who was basically kicked out of the national program after the team’s poor showing in Sochi four years ago, led the team.  It was one of the more improbable comebacks in the history of curling. With a 2-4 record and three games left in the tournament, Shuster couldn’t afford to lose another game. The team got on a roll with wins over the Canadian curling juggernauts and the number one ranked team in the world, Sweden, to capture Olympic gold. Full coverage here. Iivo Niskanen of Finland, who won a gold medal in the team sprint four years ago, proved his versatility by winning the longest race of the Olympics, the 50-kilometer mass start cross country race. It was the first gold medal for Finland at the Games, and the first medal of any kind for a Finnish man.  “It's a big deal for us, I saw the list,” Niskanen said. “The last Olympic champion in an individual race was 20 years ago."" A two-man, two-woman Swiss team out-skied Austria in the final of the Alpine team event. The new event featured four head-to-head matchups down a short slalom course with a small jump. Wendy Holdener of the winning team picked up her third medal of the Games and Ramon Zenhausern his second. Norway won the bronze. A United States team without any of its Alpine stars was eliminated by Britain in the round of 16. Kjeld Nuis of the Netherlands, the 1,500-meter winner, edged Havard Lorentzen of Norway, the 500-meter winner, in the men’s 1,000-meter speedskating race. It was the seventh gold medal for the Netherlands out of 12 events so far. The old rivals Norway and Sweden headed into the final shooting segment of the men’s biathlon relay locked in a battle for first. Fredrik Lindstroem of Sweden missed just once. But Emil Svendsen of Norway, whose poor shooting at the end dropped Norway from first to fourth four years ago, missed three times. As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth. In a thrilling end to a battle between the sport’s superpowers, the United States beat Canada by a score of 3-2 in a shootout to win the gold medal in women’s ice hockey. Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson’s goal in the sixth round of the shootout sealed the victory for the Americans, giving the team its first gold in the event since 1998. Alina Zagitova of Russia won the Olympic gold medal in women’s figure skating, edging out her countrywoman, Evgenia Medvedeva. The two skaters tied in the free skate, but Zagitova’s small edge in the short program made the difference.

5a90e4e0410cf7000162db62,2018-02-24T04:06:51+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/olympics/curling-gold-medal-final.html,Sports,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea — John Shuster, the face of American curling for the past four Winter Olympics — and all the good and bad those experiences have entailed — had a gold medal draped around his neck for the first time in his life on Saturday. Moments before, he and his teammates had done what jubilant curlers do: They raised their brooms aloft in screaming excitement over an improbable victory. Yet at that moment, it was hard to believe how close his dream had come to crumbling apart. Last Sunday, after a loss to Norway, the Americans were on the brink of elimination, again. After that game, with family headed to a hotel and his wife’s encouraging words ringing in his head, Shuster, 35, found a grassy spot outside the venue, sat down and came to a realization. “This is silly,” he told himself. “I’m getting my heart broken, I feel like, by this sport — and this is silly. Seriously, this is the Olympics.” He slept soundly that night for the first time in a long time. His team did not lose again. Five consecutive victories culminated Saturday night in something that has never happened before: an Olympic gold for the American curlers as they defeated Sweden, 10-7, before a flag-waving throng from back home. Shuster and his four teammates — Tyler George, Matt Hamilton, John Landsteiner and Joe Polo, who served as the team’s alternate — defeated Sweden, the top-ranked team in the world, so soundly that it conceded the match with several rocks to play in the 10th and final end. The victory was as decisive as it was unexpected — to everyone, perhaps, but the Americans themselves, who described themselves as a group of scrappy regular guys from Middle America. “This,” George said, “is a team that never gives up.” The United States is not known as a curling powerhouse. Americans had never won a gold medal in the sport. For that reason and more, members of the team expressed hope that curling would become more than a cultural curiosity every four years. Perhaps the team’s success here can help. “We want our sport to be loved by our country as much as we love it,” George, 35, said. “There’s a reason why we play it, and there’s a reason why we love it as much as we do.” The win came with its share of thrills. On Saturday, Shuster delivered the biggest shot in the history of American curling when he cleared two Swedish stones with his final rock of the eighth end to score 5 points. “During the entire end, we could kind of feel it building,” Shuster said. “Their margin for error got incredibly small.” Shuster had executed a perfect shot: a blend of cool-handed finesse and foolproof strategy. His team’s lead was suddenly insurmountable. “We knew we were going to lose,” Niklas Edin of Sweden said. This was Shuster’s fourth consecutive Olympic appearance, and he has experienced all the joy and heartbreak that the Games can offer. After helping the United States to a bronze medal at the 2006 Turin Games, the Americans’ next two trips to the Olympics were unmitigated disasters: last place in 2010 and next-to-last place in 2014. It got so bad that the word “shuster” was added to the Urban Dictionary. (Definition? “A verb meaning to fail to meet expectations, particularly at a moment critical for success or even slightly respectable results,” as in “Man, he really shustered that!”) Then, in the summer of 2014, Shuster was sidelined from U.S.A. Curling’s high-performance program. “Everything happens for a reason,” said Shuster, a part-time sales associate for a sporting goods store in Duluth, Minn. He found three fellow curlers from small-town Minnesota and Wisconsin who still believed in him: George, a liquor salesman who competes in eight-year-old sneakers with holes in them; Hamilton, 29, a technician for a consumer products company and a sweeping wizard renowned for his mustache; and Landsteiner, 27, an engineer. The team became known in curling circles as Team Reject, a moniker it came to embrace. And the curlers began the slow climb back to respectability, through the national ranks, through the Olympic trials and through the Olympic bonspiel, or tournament, here in South Korea, where they surmounted all kinds of obstacles. The United States had to beat Canada — Canada! — twice in four days just to reach the final. (Canada is really good at curling.) “From the day that the 2014 Olympics came to an end, every single day was with this journey in mind,” Shuster said. That much was clear as the members of Team Reject stood together atop the medal podium. Their journey was complete. Here’s how it happened: Following warm-ups and the ceremonial blaring of bagpipes (curling is a Scottish game), both teams have hit the ice. There is a huge contingent of American fans in the building, and some of them may have had refreshments this afternoon. Anyway, amid cheers of “U-S-A” and “Shoooooo” for John Shuster, the American skip, the Swedish team took the hammer in the first end, owing to their top seed in the tournament, and preserved it for the second end with a blank, meaning nobody scored. Oh, the hammer? Glad you asked. The hammer belongs to the team that gets to throw the last rock in an end, which is a huge tactical advantage. A team keeps the hammer until it scores. As a special treat, we’ll be joined here by Devin Heroux of CBC Sports, a curling aficionado who will offer his incisive analysis. Devin suddenly has some spare time on his hands because Canada — well, Canada didn’t do so hot here. More on that later. Devin Heroux: These two teams are playing in their first-ever gold medal game at the Olympics. We’ll see how USA and Sweden handle this new territory and the pressure of the moment. Swedish skip Nik Edin has won world championships and knows big game pressure. American skip John Shuster has been around the sport for a long time, including winning bronze with Pete Fenson’s team at the 2006 Olympics. Expect these first couple ends (maybe more) to be wide open as both teams get a feel for the ice and calm their nerves. It should also be pointed out that Edin likes to play an open style of curling and pounce on opposition mistakes — the Americans haven’t made many in their five-game winning streak. We’re seeing some high-level curling from both sides. The Swedes packed the second end with exquisite shotmaking, and when John Shuster misfired on a double takeout with his last stone of the end, Nik Edin took advantage, scoring two for Sweden. Edin is widely regarded as the best skip in the world for a reason. Opponents pay for making mistakes against him. Also, Ivanka Trump is here with a swarm of secret service personnel. Devin Heroux: Edin learned how to curl by watching past Canadian curling championship games on VHS tapes while growing up in Sweden. In fact, his favorite curler to watch was Kevin Martin. He studied his strategy and learned the game by watching tapes over and over. Edin moved his team to Canada two years ago for a year to practice in the curling-crazed nation and compete against the top teams there. His team is fully funded by the Swedish government to curl. This is their full-time job, to curl and win a gold medal at the Olympics. Tyler George, the American vice skip who wears really ratty sneakers, made two outstanding shots to set up Shuster, who came through in a huge way: a double takeout on his last throw to score two for the Americans and tie the match. More chants of “U-S-A!” are filling this place. Throughout their run here, the members of the American team have given huge credit to Dr. Carly Anderson, who came on as U.S.A. Curling’s sports psychologist after their dismal showing at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. “We’ve had team meetings where we’re kind of slumping, and she’s just tough on us,” Matt Hamilton said in an interview before the start of the Olympics. “She’ll tell us, ‘You guys have to pull your heads out of your butts!’ She’ll tell it how it is.” Anderson has worked with the players in individual and group sessions. A huge emphasis, she said, has been developing strategies to help them execute in pressure situations. So far, so good. Devin Heroux: In this third end, it was all about placement of stones and getting the proper angles. Edin changed the end around by making a double and rolling perfectly. This is how precise the game has become. But a slight error by Edin on his last rock allowed Shuster a tough double takeout and he threw his rock perfectly to score two. Sweden likes low-scoring battles. They wait for their opponents to crack. The USA has hung tough with teams throughout this Olympic competition. We’ll see how Shuster and his team handle the added pressure of this game, though. Sweden is the top-ranked team in the world right now. USA has the ability to play a simple style of curling but can also complicate the game and draw opponents into making mistakes. Many curlers in the game say Shuster has the ability to single-handedly win a curling game because of his shotmaking brilliance. He’ll need to do that today to propel the Americans to their first gold at the Olympics. “Yep! Yep! Whoa! Whoa!” This is the soundtrack being provided at the moment by the Americans, who are putting all sorts of pressure on the Swedes. After a measurement, the United States stole a point (Sweden had the hammer) to take their first lead of the match. This is heady stuff for John Shuster and his teammates. It sounds as if all of Duluth is here at Gangneung Curling Centre, and these people are screaming. The measurement stick is a tool that’s used when it’s impossible to tell with the naked eye which rock is closest to the button. Devin Heroux: It was textbook American curling in the 4th end. Shuster and his team love to complicate the game and force their opponents into making mistakes. And that’s exactly what happened. Edin had a bad miss with his first. Shuster applied more pressure and on Edin’s last throw he was a little heavy and wide giving up a steal to the Americans. What’s important about this steal is now the Swedes have last rock in the odd ends. Americans want to force Sweden to a single point in the 5th end and try to keep the last rock in the 6th, 8th and 10th and final end. That’s how they’ll try to play this game out, to have last rock advantage for the last shot of the game. John Shuster was heavy on his last stone, which flashed the house, meaning it rolled straight through without touching anything, and Sweden capitalized, scoring two to regain the lead as we head into the fifth-end break. (That’s halftime to you football fans.) The pressure is mounting. But remember: The Americans won four straight matches heading into this final. Their chemistry has never been better. Also, Mr. T told them to win. I pity the fool who disappoints Mr. T. Devin Heroux: It was more textbook American curling in the 5th end — cluttered, confusing and messy, which is exactly how this team wins games. Shuster likes a lot of rocks in play and loves to put pressure on his opponents. Sweden has fallen into the trap and are struggling to escape it. When Shuster has a lead, he plays with tremendous confidence. But the game can be unforgiving. Shuster was heavy on his last shot and Edin made a perfect draw shot to score two points. It takes eight made shots to score in this game. Shuster missed one. Edin didn’t. Niklas Edin, the Swedish skip, missed just to the left on his second-to-last throw of the end, leaving an American stone in the house. It was a small but significant blunder, and Edin doesn’t usually make small but significant blunders. The Americans are getting their opportunities, and John Shuster made two solid shots to ultimately score two. The United States pulls back ahead. Devin Heroux: When you get to this level of curling, the slightest error can be the difference. Edin missed a tough run back takeout on his first shot, allowing the Americans to put two rocks in the house. Edin tried a hit and roll on his last shot and missed again. Shuster made him pay with a perfect draw shot and a score of two. One of the big things to consider is how the teams read the ice throughout the game. The ice conditions change throughout the game due to rocks sliding over and over the ice. It can also change because of the body heat in the building, creating frost on the ice. The players have to adapt. The teams that are able to do this first win the game. Niklas Edin, the finest curler in the world, appears to be feeling that Olympic pressure. After another huge miss with his first shot of the seventh end, he bounced back to save a point for Sweden with the hammer, tying the score. But the United States is in great shape, with the hammer heading to the eighth — and on track to have it in the 10th. John Shuster is more than deserving of the accolades he’s gotten during this bonspiel (curling talk for tournament), but his teammates have been outstanding. Matt Hamilton, the mustachioed social media hero for the Americans, executed a brilliant double takeout in the middle of the seventh end. And Tyler George, whose shots set up Shuster at the back of each end, has been one of the sharpest players on the ice. Devin Heroux: Curling is one of few sports where adrenaline can be a bad thing — curlers have to calm their nerves and settle down before throwing big shots. Right now it looks like this young Swedish team is letting their nerves and adrenaline get the better of them. They are missing routine shots. Edin said that was his one concern, that they would let the pressure of the moment get to them. Edin, however, has been here before in these pressure games and made one of the more remarkable shots of the Olympic tournament to score a single in the 7th end. It’s a shot that might have saved the game for his team. But Shuster’s team looks calm and confident with three ends left to decide this gold medal game. John Shuster just nailed the most important shot in American curling history: a double takeout for five points and a seemingly insurmountable lead for the Americans entering the ninth end. The gold is all but theirs. The crowd is going bananas. Devin Heroux: The Americans have been putting pressure on Sweden the entire game. You could see it and sense it in the building. The pressure was on and in the 8th end Sweden cracked. A massive score of five in the 8th end by the United States has all but sealed this victory for a team that was once in jeopardy of missing the Olympic curling playoffs all together. It is a remarkable story about how this Shuster team never stopped believing and are now narrowing in on the country’s first gold medal in curling. The United States, playing conservatively, gave up two to Sweden here in the ninth end, but still has a 10-7 lead (and the hammer) entering the 10th and final end. It would take a meltdown of intergalactic proportions for John Shuster & Co. to lose this match. Devin Heroux: John Shuster has curled for a very long time. He’s had some serious low points throughout his career. But he never stopped playing the game he loves. He has kids now. He talks about them often and how different his perspective is in life and curling. This is his moment now. He’s a few rocks away from being the first-ever Olympic curling champion from the United States, alongside his team. Devin Heroux: It is one of the more improbable comebacks in the history of curling — and perhaps sports. Team Shuster was on the ropes and seemingly down and out at the Olympics. With a 2-4 record and three games left in the tournament, Shuster couldn’t afford to lose another game. The team got on a roll and started believing they could win it all. That belief propelled them to wins over the Canadian curling juggernauts and then over the No. 1-ranked team in the world, Sweden, to capture Olympic gold. It’s a historic win. The country’s first. But how they did it is even more incredible.",15896

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — The Winter Olympics has featured acts of athleticism too fast to be fully appreciated. These three medalists in the women’s downhill each traveled more than 65 miles per hour down the mountain. Here, we revisit other moments, frame by frame.

Sofia Goggia 1:39.22 Many of the competitors in the women’s slopestyle event fell victim to gusty winds, including Japan’s Yuka Fujimori, 31. She completed her first run, shown here, but crashed in her second run and finished 9th. Jamie Anderson, 27, of the United States, adjusted her runs because of the weather and won gold, scoring nearly 7 points ahead of the silver medalist. Mikaela Shiffrin, 22, of the United States, who had sought multiple golds in Pyeongchang, took the top slot in the giant slalom after roaring down the steep and taxing course, a portion of which is shown here. For this, her only gold, she finished 0.39 seconds ahead of the silver medalist. In the downhill portion of the combined, Shiffrin finished sixth, nearly two seconds behind her teammate Lindsey Vonn, 33. Shiffrin made up ground by attacking the slalom portion of the race to win the silver medal. The fast, technical turns Shiffrin is known for were on display in this final section of the course, below. American luge doubles Matt Mortensen, 32, and Jayson Terdiman, 29, sped down the track at more than 70 miles per hour and finished their first run in sixth place, in striking distance of a spot on the podium. But in their second run, shown below, they posted a slower time, and finished the event in 10th place. Norway won the ski jumping team event, collectively jumping nearly 13 meters farther than the German team, which took silver. Robert Johansson, 27, shown here in his final jump, had the second longest jumps of the four-man Norway team. Chloe Kim, the 17-year-old American, won gold with a nearly perfect score in halfpipe. She had already secured the gold after her first run. But she went bigger and bolder in her final run, executing back-to-back 1080s, a combination that she first landed in 2016. No other woman has matched that feat in competition.

Yuzuru Hanyu, 23, of Japan, successfully defended his gold medal in figure skating with a performance that combined both artistry and jumping ability.

5a90d33a410cf7000162db4e,2018-02-24T02:51:32+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/baseball/aaron-boones-no-17-its-personal-not-motivational.html,Sports,"TAMPA, Fla. — The baseball season is an endurance test, running from mid-February until at least the end of October for two lucky teams. In a game that is played at a languid pace — no matter how many times a catcher is permitted to visit the pitcher’s mound — there are surely moments, like a midsummer weeknight game in Atlanta or Arlington, Tex., when the mind may wander. For the last decade, the Yankees’ focus could easily be snapped to attention. The sight of the No. 28 on Joe Girardi’s jersey served as an “O.K., everybody, let’s get back to work” moment, a reminder of the Yankees’ raison d’être: chasing World Series title No. 28. In his 10 years as manager, Girardi was often a proxy for the Yankees’ ideals. There he was, year after year: jaw squared, hair closely cropped, relentlessly pursuing championships, no matter how broken down or unproven the roster would become. His choice of a jersey — he wore No. 27 in his first two seasons in New York, until the Yankees won title No. 27 in 2009 — was a convenient touchstone for the two types of baseball fans: those who love the Yankees and those who despise them. Depending on one’s view, the jersey was either purposeful inspiration or insufferable sloganeering. With Girardi gone, how will the Yankees stir themselves from a midsummer slumber and remember just what they are hunting? It may have to come from within. Their new manager, Aaron Boone, will wear No. 17. The number is meaningful only to Boone. He was given No. 17 by the Cincinnati Reds, who drafted him out of the University of Southern California and for whom he played parts of seven seasons before being shipped to the Yankees in 2003. When he arrived in New York as a player, No. 17, which had been worn by Gene Michael, Mickey Rivers and Oscar Gamble, among others, was being used by catcher John Flaherty, who is now a Yankees broadcaster. So Boone took No. 19, an ode to his college coach, Mike Gillespie, and to Greg Luzinski, a close friend and teammate of Boone’s father on the Philadelphia Phillies. Boone went back to No. 17 while with the Cleveland Indians in 2005 and 2006, then wore No. 8 — his father and grandfather’s numbers — in his final seasons with the Florida Marlins, the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros. “I guess when I consider my playing career, I think of No. 17,” Boone said. “So when No. 17 was available with the Yankees, I was like, I’ll take that.” Boone said there would be no subliminal reminders of what the Yankees are chasing this year. They will be among the favorites, along with the defending champion Astros, Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox, to reach the World Series. Indeed, in the early days of spring training under Boone, there are no T-shirt slogans (like the ones Chicago Cubs Manager Joe Maddon ritually trots out) or new motivational signs (like the ones that dot many major league clubhouses). In fact, when asked last week if there was anything new about spring training this year, C. C. Sabathia said, “We’ve got different lockers — that’s about it so far.” Boone has taken a relaxed stance in spring training: blowing bubbles, chomping on gum, a bat seemingly always in hand, and a Yankees cap tilted back on his head as he bounces among the workout stations. He wants his hitters to be “obsessed” with controlling the strike zone and his pitchers to be “aggressively attacking” the strike zone. But he will leave much of the reinforcement of those themes to his coaching staff. “Certainly we have things that are going to be incredibly important to us,” Boone said. “There are certainly messages that we want to be able to drive home through our positional coaches. But as far as me saying I want to put an overall stamp on it, no.” The Yankees, the first team to put numbers on the backs of uniforms, have a peculiar relationship with them. Their 21 retired numbers are by far the most of any franchise, and then there are the ones that are unofficially off the books. Paul O’Neill’s No. 21 has been worn only briefly since he retired in 2001, even though Todd Frazier badly wanted it last season. Alex Rodriguez’s No. 13 has not been put back into circulation since he was sent into retirement in the middle of the 2016 season. And no Yankee has worn No. 0. This season, No. 28, the number formerly worn by Girardi, will be worn by Austin Romine, the backup catcher. It arrived to him by happenstance. Romine wore No. 27 the last two seasons, but when the Yankees acquired Giancarlo Stanton, the reigning National League most valuable player, in the off-season, Stanton inquired about the number. He wore No. 27 for his entire career with the Marlins. Romine acceded to Stanton’s wishes and shooed away an offer of compensation. (When John Lackey arrived in St. Louis several years ago, he gave Pat Neshek a Babe Ruth-autographed baseball for giving up No. 41.) “I’m just happy to have a number,” said Romine, who has worn more of them than any other Yankee: 71, 53, 45, 62, 27 and now 28. “I said: Is 28 available? Then I’ll take 28.” Romine called it a plus that his new number was worn by Girardi, a former catcher whom Romine respects. Growing up, Romine always wanted to wear No. 16, the number his father, Kevin, wore with the Boston Red Sox, but he knew that would not happen the moment he was drafted by the Yankees. “Whitey Ford took care of that a long time ago,” Romine said, referring to the Hall of Fame pitcher whose number was retired in 1974. For the time being, the number that represented so much for the Yankees for the previous eight seasons will mean something less. There is no symbolism in No. 28 this season for the man who will wear it, no inherent reminders for players and fans of what the Yankees are chasing this season. “For me,” Romine said, “it’s just the next number.”",5807
5a90c85b410cf7000162db3e,2018-02-24T02:05:08+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/baseball/mets-dominic-smith.html,Sports,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — By Mickey Callaway’s estimate, he has used the word “accountable” thousands of times since taking over as the Mets manager last year, whether in interviews with the news media or in conversations with players. On Friday, before managing for the first time in a game, albeit a spring training exhibition, Callaway showed what he meant. Dominic Smith, 22, a rookie first baseman who lost 35 pounds in the off-season and is vying to impress team officials, showed up late for an 8:45 a.m. team meeting before Friday’s game against the Atlanta Braves. The penalty from Callaway: Smith was scratched from the starting lineup. “It’s a little shocking,” Callaway said. “He’s trying to win a job.” Punctuality was the No. 1 rule Callaway discussed in his first team meeting about expectations for the season. After a Friday morning visit to the manager’s office, Smith described Callaway as “pretty fair” about the punishment. “He asked what I thought the decision should be, and I agreed with him,” Smith said. “That’s the only way it should be. That’s what he’s been preaching since Day 1: accountable. And you have to be accountable for yourself and your actions.” Friday offered Callaway much to do beyond tone-setting. After dealing with Smith, Callaway watched the Mets beat the Braves, 6-2, at First Data Field. He smiled as he watched Mets players tackle the areas of improvement emphasized during camp. Zack Wheeler, who is fighting for a spot on the major league roster, as either a back-of-the-rotation starter or a reliever, looked impressive in a one-inning outing. He threw 15 pitches and struck out two. His fastball was clocked at 97 miles per hour. After Ozzie Albies led off with a single, Wheeler did his part to remedy the Mets’ past troubles with base runners. He held the ball on the mound longer than normal, disrupting Albies’s timing on a stolen-base attempt. Second baseman Jose Reyes dropped the ball after a well-timed throw from catcher Travis d’Arnaud, who has struggled to throw out runners. That moment, along with aggressive base running by Wilmer Flores and heads-up defense by Ty Kelly in left field, pleased the new manager. Callaway said “doing all the little things” would separate players fighting for a spot on the team. Scrutinizing every player on the field was new for Callaway, who spent the previous five years as the pitching coach of the Cleveland Indians. Earlier in the week, he joked that he wished spring training had 60 games instead of 31, for his own sake. “The learning is never over,” he said. “This is definitely spring training for me.” Smith’s slip-up was a learning moment, and a reminder for the rest of the team. But Smith’s admission of fault — and his vow not to repeat it — came only after some minor fumbling by the Mets. Once Smith was replaced in the lineup by the prospect Peter Alonso, public relations officials said the team simply wanted to get Alonso some at-bats. But when reporters asked Smith why he suddenly was not playing, he said that he did not know why and that he was not injured. Smith was soon called into Callaway’s office. He then huddled with the public relations officials. Afterward, Smith addressed reporters again, explaining what had happened. Smith said he missed his alarm because he had stayed up late, lost in his thoughts about starting the first spring training game and the desire to prove himself in camp. (The Mets signed the veteran first baseman Adrian Gonzalez to a one-year deal this winter to give Smith more time to develop.) Smith was not specific about his arrival time, but he said he was “late enough for it to be a problem.” He added: “I shouldn’t be cutting it that close as it is. I’m a professional and it’s my career and my livelihood. I let them down today.” Third baseman Todd Frazier, another veteran the Mets signed in the off-season, said he considered Smith’s transgression minor. “He’s a young guy,” Frazier said. “He’s still trying to understand the game. Can’t really have that kind of stuff, though. It’s one of those things where you’d rather be overly early than late. He’s going to learn from it.”",4143
5a90c32a410cf7000162db3b,2018-02-24T01:43:00+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/baseball/yankees-giancarlo-stanton.html,Sports,"TAMPA, Fla. — The old standbys were in place for the Yankees’ exhibition opener at Steinbrenner Field: a high school marching band, bunting hanging from the front of the suites and a near-capacity crowd. But there was something else hanging in the air on this sun-soaked Friday afternoon: expectations. “The expectation level is through the roof,” said Mario Ranieri Jr., a lifelong Yankees fan who attended the game with his father, Mario Sr., and his son, Anthony. “Everybody’s got us winning the World Series and the Super Bowl.” Perhaps that’s possible — the Yankees after all recently acquired the rights to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson — but Friday was more about the anticipation after last season’s rousing playoff run, which ended one game short of the World Series, and the off-season acquisition of the slugger Giancarlo Stanton. With Aaron Judge coming off shoulder surgery and not expected to make his spring debut until the middle of next week — and with Gary Sanchez also out of the lineup until Monday night — the spotlight was ceded to Stanton, the reigning National League most valuable player, who hit 59 home runs last season. Stanton, who played right field for four innings, drew a walk and grounded into a double play before departing from the Yankees’ 3-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers. Stanton received a long, loud welcome from fans when the lineups were introduced, and he couldn’t help noticing. Asked how the day was different from his exhibition openers with the Miami Marlins, who drafted him 10 years ago, Stanton paused for a moment. “This is better,” he said with a smile. “More excitement,” he continued. “I’d say, ‘Can’t wait, happy for spring.’ It’s a spring game, but ‘can’t wait to see what we can do.’ That’s what would be the difference.” Stanton said that when the Yankees break camp in five weeks, he would like to be “feeling how I would when I’m grooving in a season. That’s a little bit of everything — timing, sight. I think the thing that takes the longest is the mental aspect of the pitches, the sequencing, how they’re going to pitch with runners on, without — getting the rust off of that.” Those are the words of an established star. For many others, Friday marked the start of a pursuit of the few roster spots that are up for grabs: second and third base, and perhaps a spot in the bullpen if the Yankees carry eight relievers. Second baseman Gleyber Torres, the slight front-runner among six candidates for the starting job, dove for Leonys Martin’s leadoff grounder up the middle. The ball glanced off his glove, and Torres rose gingerly, not over concern about his left arm — which needed elbow surgery last August — but because he had the wind knocked out of him. “You do hold your breath a little more for your guys now in this role,” said Aaron Boone, who left the ESPN broadcast booth to manage the Yankees this season. But Boone was pleased that Torres, who later forgot how many outs there were, could begin to settle in. Torres, who wore a long-sleeved Michael Jordan “I’m back” T-shirt — a comeback announcement that came nine months before Torres was born — said he was not thinking about the competition. “I just try to stay focused, do my job every day,” he said. One of Torres’s competitors, Tyler Wade, was able to distinguish himself. Though he could not corral a bad-hop grounder while playing shortstop and was charged with an error, Wade stretched a base hit to center field into a double, advanced to third on a balk that he may have forced and came home on Jake Cave’s groundout to tie the score at 1-1 in the sixth. Jorge Saez later added a two-out, two-run single in the inning. Wade, who hit .155 in sporadic duty with the Yankees, said earlier in the day that he hoped to use this spring to show the type of dynamic player he had been at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. “I’m excited to show my game,” Wade said. It was the first meeting between the Tigers and the Yankees since last August, when there were three bench-clearing brawls, including one that began with a confrontation between the Tigers star Miguel Cabrera and Yankees catcher Austin Romine. When Cabrera came to bat in the first inning Friday, he appeared to have a quick word with Romine. “I think on some level, baseball players never forget things,” Boone said. “One of our messages will always be we’re out there to win games and compete, and turn the page on those kinds of things the best we can.” INSIDE PITCH Both teams — like others in baseball — wore the caps of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, the site of last week’s shooting in Parkland, Fla. … Along with adding protective netting at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees have added 10-foot netting behind the dugouts at Steinbrenner Field. It may not be high enough. Yankees outfielder Estevan Florial lost his grip on a bat, which went flying over the net on the first-base dugout before a fan reached up and grabbed it. “A fan made a heck of a catch over there,” Boone said.",4994
5a9091b6410cf7000162dad5,2018-02-23T22:12:00+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/football/jonathan-martin.html,Sports,"Jonathan Martin, the former N.F.L. offensive lineman who was at the center of a bullying scandal in 2013, was detained by the police after posting a seemingly threatening message on social media. A photograph he posted on Instagram showed a shotgun and included a message that said bullying victims had only two choices, suicide and revenge. It included the name of the private high school he attended in Los Angeles, prompting officials there to shut the school on Friday. “When you’re a bully victim & a coward, your options are suicide, or revenge,” the post read. The incident comes less than two weeks after a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killed 17 teachers and students. Officials at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles sent an alert to students around 7 a.m. Friday. Martin, who posted the image on his Instagram account on Thursday, did not explicitly threaten the school. But the photo of the shotgun and shells included the hashtag #HarvardWestlake. “Out of abundance of caution, and because the safety of our students, faculty, and staff is our top priority, we made the decision to close school today,” the school said in a statement. “We are working closely with law enforcement and will share more information when we are able.” Martin’s photo also included the hashtag #MiamiDolphins, the team that drafted him out of Stanford in 2012. In 2013, Martin left the team after seven games because he said that another offensive lineman, Richie Incognito, had repeatedly bullied him and used racist language. Martin left the team abruptly and later said that he was under psychological duress and had considered suicide. Incognito was suspended for bullying Martin, other teammates and a team employee. Martin played the next season for the San Francisco 49ers, but has not appeared in an N.F.L. game since then. Incognito sat out the 2014 season, but played the next three years for the Buffalo Bills. A 144-page report commissioned by the N.F.L. to explore allegations of bullying on the Dolphins found that Incognito and two fellow offensive linemen, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey, “engaged in a pattern of harassment” toward Martin; another young offensive lineman; and an assistant trainer, including improper touching and sexual taunting. In his post on Instagram on Thursday, Martin included the social media handles for Incognito and Pouncey, among others. Incognito insisted that he never bullied Martin and was in fact his friend and mentor. Many of the more than 1,000 text messages between Incognito and Martin that were released contained lewd descriptions and profane language that could be viewed as part of a friendship. But privately, Martin was furious. According to the report, the mistreatment began early in the 2012 season, Martin’s rookie year, and the frequency of insults grew after Martin refused to fight back. Incognito, who is white, sometimes made jokes about slavery in the presence of Martin, who is black, the report said.",3010
5a908f9e410cf7000162dace,2018-02-23T22:03:06+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/south-korea-speedskating.html,Sports,"SEOUL, South Korea — It was an off night for short-track speedskating at the Winter Olympics, but everywhere else around South Korea, the skating never ends. There are champions to build and rosters to fill for 2022, 2026 and beyond. Two teenage boys, each expecting to be part of the South Korean team at the 2022 Beijing Games, zoomed around the old Gwacheon Ice Rink, heads down, moving as one. As they leaned hard and pumped their legs around one tight corner, a coach held a 9-year-old girl, standing on her skates, by the arms. With perfect timing, he flung her onto the ice, like a fisherman casting a net into the sea. The rocket boost propelled her to speed and landed her in line with the boys, as if they all wore magnets. Three became one. Around they went. Like the dozens of others who call the rink home, they practice six days a week, two or three hours each day. “I have trained abroad,” said Lee Seung-Hwan, the kid-flinging coach and a member of South Korea’s long-track speedskating team at the 2002 Salt Lake Games. “I have never seen another country train its children as hard as we do here, from the time they are very young.” With its single sheet of ice and pale yellow walls, Gwacheon is one of three primary rinks in the Seoul area where young skaters are molded into champions. It is where the figure skater Yuna Kim, the gold medalist in the 2010 Vancouver Games, trained, along with several top speedskaters of the past 30 years, including members of this year’s Olympic team. In the hallways where boys and girls as young as 5 do their warm-up exercises, not far from the snack stand, glass cases display uniforms, skates and autographed photographs of past champions. There are bronzed hand prints of six of them. A big sign on the wall says, “World Star Zone.” One of the display cases is empty, except for a placard. “Are you next?” it reads. In South Korea, figure skating captures the imagination, but speedskating captures the medals. Most Winter Olympics success comes in the short-track version of racing, that whirling dervish of a sport where power and grace can be upended instantly by minor collisions and mass wipeouts. Before the Pyeongchang Games, South Korea had won 53 medals in its Winter Olympics history, and 42 were in short-track speedskating. (It was not until these Olympics that South Korea, part of the Winter Olympics since 1948, won a medal in a sport that did not include a skate. That was a gold in men’s skeleton, and Yun Sung-bin is now a national hero.) It is wildly popular on television, the must-see event of the Olympics, and the names of its champions are carved deep in the collective memory. At these Olympics, South Korea won three of the eight events in short-track speedskating, and six medals over all in the sport, more than any other country. Names like Choi Min-jeong, Shim Suk-hee and Kim Alang (all women) and Lim Hyo-jun (men’s 1,500 meter winner) and silver-medalist Hwang Dae-heon joined the pantheon. Like the children at Gwacheon Ice Rink, they were trained as conventional speedskaters until the paths divided — one toward short-track speedskating, with its bursts of power and maneuverability (like driving a Ferrari on a go-kart track, as one coach at the rink said), the other toward long track, with its steady, graceful churn against only the clock. More children than ever are sliding toward long track, their coaches and parents seeing a way toward the medal stand in a less-crowded field. The long-track events continue through Saturday, but with one night to go, South Korea had five medals. Only the Netherlands had more. South Korea’s success in skating is unusual because there are not a lot of rinks in the country — a couple dozen regular-sized rinks, plus one long-track oval at Taereung National Training Center, a vast multi-sport complex in Seoul. (The oval built in Gangneung for the Olympics, about 100 miles away, is expected to be converted into a convention center.) “In a way, it’s a good thing,” Lee, the coach, said. “Because of these limitations, because of the small numbers, we can really focus our support on these kids. Maybe that is a secret to the success.” The group at Gwacheon numbers more than 100, divided into A, B and C groups, depending on ability. The C group is filled with young children, fitted with helmets, taught to crouch low, to cross their right legs over their left and power through corners. About three dozen are in the B group. Five are in A, including Lee Jin-woo, 15, the top skater of his age in the country. “When I see the Olympic athletes go on the podium to get their medals, I feel very jealous, in a good way,” he said. Lee expects to forge his future in long track, the same as Lee, his coach (they are not related), did. Choosing either short or long track can be difficult at a young age, since almost all training of children is done on regular-sized rinks, like those used for hockey or figure skating. “We teach the power of how you skate, the speed and control,” said Choi Sung-hoon, the manager of the physical education department at Gwacheon Ice Rink. The ability to navigate through crowds, the willingness to bump and grind with other skaters in short track, Choi said, is something deep inside some skaters more than others. “I think you are born with that skill,” he said. Outside his office, groups of children jogged warm-up laps up and down the hallway. They crouched beside two-foot hurdles and, when a coach told them, jumped over them and landed in a crouch again. Lee, the coach, wore a strap around his legs, the kind one might use to strap cargo to a car roof, and young skaters in the hall climbed inside the loop and leaned hard to the left, the way they would on the ice, to strengthen their leg muscles. They practiced the right-over-left movements as they side-winded down the hall, as low as they could go, pulling Lee with them. In a training room, children carried each other on their backs and did deep knee bends. They stretched with large rubber bands. Even the youngest ones come every day of the week, except Monday. On the ice, figure skaters twirled in the middle of the rink while more than a dozen of the best young speedskaters rushed around them in a single string, moving like a high-speed centipede. Lee, the tallest of the juniors, was at the head, in a speed suit with protective glasses on. Others followed him like crouching shadows, noses to backsides, mostly descending in size and age, all the way to a 9-year-old girl at the tail. Two corners of the rink had crash pads, in case an accidental slip or trip sent any or all of the children crashing out of line. On this night, it did not happen. “I’m a little afraid that I will fall,” said Park Ji-yoon, 11, who wants to be either a teacher or an Olympic speedskater when she grows up. “I just follow the person in front of me without thinking.” The next day, Lee, the coach, drove three of his top boys to the national oval, a 45-minute drive across Seoul. They make the trip two or three times a week, practicing on the big oval with 200 or more other young skaters, under the tutelage of about 30 coaches, all hoping that they will be in the Olympics next time, or the time after that. Tight strings of skaters wove circles around the vast sheet, the ones behind mimicking the one in front, so they all swirled as one, like schools of fish or flocks of birds. Lee Jin-woo, the 15-year-old, led the two others from his home rink — Jeon Min-jae, 14, and An Sung-jun, 13. Lee, the coach, tracked them through the crowds of other skaters, the strings moving at different speeds. He held a stopwatch and barked orders at them as they glided past. Stay synchronized, he shouted near the end of the workout, as their collective rhythm disintegrated. He knows he is hard on them. He knows that they talk about him when he is out of earshot. He was one of them once, too, before he became an Olympian. “There’s a lot of potential in these kids,” he said. “They’ve already broken the records of the Olympians when they were this age.” The boys came off the ice silently, then into a dressing room to remove their skates and catch their breath. Within minutes, they were back in Lee’s car, headed across Seoul, back to Gwacheon Ice Rink, closer to home. They were going to practice another hour on the short track.",8357

The terms of the settlement are sealed and confidential. “It’s been a long time, but it’s something I wanted to do,” Bouchard said of the lawsuit. “It’s been two and a half years, so I’m happy it’s over.” In a statement later Friday, the U.S.T.A. said the matter “has reached an amicable conclusion for both parties” and added, “We also wish Ms. Bouchard the best of luck moving forward.” Bouchard sued the U.S.T.A. in October 2015, about six weeks after she slipped on cleaning fluid on the floor of a dimly lit trainers room at the U.S. Open in New York. She had to withdraw from the singles, doubles and mixed doubles events, and she did not complete a match for the rest of that season. Bouchard, 23, won the  liability phase of the trial on Thursday, though the jury said that she bore 25 percent of the comparative negligence for her injury. That meant that the U.S.T.A. would have had to pay Bouchard only 75 percent of whatever value the jury assigned to her damages. “I feel vindicated that I got the verdict yesterday,” Bouchard said. “Just relief and happiness right now.” After each side’s lawyers made lengthy opening arguments in the damages phase of the trial at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, proceedings were suspended for four hours as the legal teams, Bouchard and representatives from the U.S.T.A. met. Benedict Morelli, Bouchard’s lawyer, initially said he was ready to put her on the stand after the hours of talks had not yielded a resolution. She testified Wednesday in the liability phase of the trial. But in the corridors of the courthouse, Morelli appeared to persuade Bouchard, who was alongside her mother, Julie Leclair, to take the deal the U.S.T.A. had offered. “When people attack you and attack your name, you get affected by that,” Morelli said of Bouchard’s hesitation. “When you’re resolving it, you want to make sure you can live with it.” “She’s pleasantly living with it,” he added. Leclair began to cry as she expressed her relief at the settlement. “Just relieved that it’s over,” she said. “We try to put it out of our minds, but it’s been a tough two years. Tough on her, tough on the whole family, and I’m just glad it’s over.” The opening arguments of the damages phase set up what could have been fascinating, speculative arguments about how Bouchard’s career might have proceeded had the injury not occurred. She reached the fourth round of the 2015 U.S. Open before being forced to withdraw. Morelli contended that Bouchard, then No. 25 in the world, was likely to win her next two matches and make the semifinals, because she was ranked ahead of the women who would have been her opponents, No. 43 Roberta Vinci and No. 40 Kristina Mladenovic. He further argued that Bouchard would have had a chance to win against top-ranked Serena Williams in the semifinals, mentioning that “Genie has beaten Serena Williams in the past.” He did not disclose that that win had come at the Hopman Cup exhibition event, which is not counted in head-to-head records. Alan Kaminsky, the U.S.T.A.’s lawyer, countered by pointing out that Bouchard’s results had been poor throughout the 2015 season. He noted that she had lost, badly, to Vinci just one week before the Open and that she had a losing record against Mladenovic. “The chances of her winning the U.S. Open that year were extremely not good,” Kaminsky said. The U.S.T.A. also appeared ready to dispute the nature of Bouchard’s injury itself, rebutting the diagnosis of a concussion. (At the time of her withdrawal from the tournament, Open officials announced that a concussion was her official reason.) Kaminsky said that numerous magnetic resonance imaging exams were found to be negative for a concussion. “She did have a bang to the head, and was treated properly for that,” he said. Kaminsky also countered Bouchard’s assertion that she had lost millions in possible endorsement deals because of the fall, saying she “did not lose one endorsement deal” after the accident. “When you hear how much money Ms. Bouchard has made from endorsements, you’re not going to believe it,” Kaminsky told the jury. “It’s staggering.” The jury did not end up hearing that information, which Bouchard had been eager to keep private. She had filed a motion, which was denied, seeking to remove reporters from the courtroom for testimony regarding her endorsements. Bouchard had also wanted her social media posts to be kept out of the trial, arguing that they painted a misleadingly sunny portrait of her life since the injury. Judge Ann M. Donnelly ruled against that request, too, saying that the court is public and that social media is an admissible record of her state of mind pertaining to various claims of emotional damages and psychological suffering. Bouchard’s next tournament is expected to be in Indian Wells, Calif., in March. She is currently ranked 116th, well outside the cutoff for the main draw, but she said she was hoping to receive a wild card.",5182
5a907484410cf7000162da84,2018-02-23T20:07:26+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/olympics/olympics-speedsakting-mass-start.html,Sports,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea — For an athlete who had just missed out on an Olympic medal by 34-hundredths of a second, Joey Mantia was positively beaming. Mantia, a long-track speedskater representing the United States, came in fourth on Friday night in the men’s 1,000-meter event at the Gangneung Oval. Sitting in third place with one pair left to skate, Mantia watched with a smile on his face as Kjeld Nuis of the Netherlands rattled off a time of 1 minute 7.95 seconds to take the gold medal and bump him from the podium. “I needed him to really mess up,” Mantia said with a laugh. “I was trying to be optimistic, but at the same time realistic. I totally didn’t see this coming. I thought if I was top 10 coming out of tonight I’d be happy, so fourth is — I’m floating right now.” For Mantia, who has competed in two events to this point, everything has been building to the mass-start event on Saturday, when he will attempt to win the first gold medal for the United States in long-track speedskating since the 2010 Games in Vancouver. (The women’s team-pursuit group won a bronze medal this week, giving the United States its one and only long-track speedskating medal of these Games and breaking an eight-year general-medal drought.) Mantia is among the favorites in the race, and Heather Bergsma of the United States is a top contender in the women’s version of the event, meaning the last and best chance for American speedskaters to win a gold here will come in a new Olympic event that, in some ways, does not resemble long-track speedskating at all. Mass-start speedskating was one of four new events at the 2018 Olympics. It debuted on the World Cup circuit during the 2011-12 season. Other events in long-track speedskating are pure time trials, wherein athletes, in pairs, race the clock and know where they’ve finished only after everyone has finished skating. Mass start puts up to 28 skaters on the ice at the same time to race 16 laps around the 400-meter oval. Competitors are not restricted to their lanes, as in other long-track events. Skaters therefore have to think about much more than pure speed. They make tactical decisions about whether to stick with the pack or make a breakaway move. They draft one another and try to read their intentions. Some say it resembles short-track speedskating on a long-track oval. Some say it feels more like a running or cycling race. Mantia said mass start was something casual spectators might enjoy more than the other long-track events, which unfold in stop-and-start increments and often can be anticlimactic. “I’ve been doing long-track for about six years now, and I love the sport, but it’s a little tough to watch sometimes,” Mantia said in an interview before the Games. But mass-start races are different, he added. “It’s 16 laps, but it keeps you engaged the whole time. There’s always something going on, and you know as soon as the race finishes, first is gold, second is silver and third is bronze. It’s simple. It’s relatable.” In the interview, Mantia said he still sometimes struggled with the mental side of long-track speedskating: the feeling of intense solitude on the ice, the inevitable ebb and flow of confidence and self-doubt. He said he had made progress in those areas with the help of sports psychologists. But mass start, he said, has always been a refuge. “Once I started doing mass starts, I was like, O.K., that all goes out the window,” Mantia said before the Olympics. “Even if everything else goes completely terrible, and falls short of all expectations, I still race and win in mass start. “That’s always kind of the ace up my sleeve,’’ he added. Teammates said Mantia’s background in in-line skating in Florida, before switching to ice, instilled in him the proper instincts to navigate the more hectic and unpredictable mass-start competition. “Every race in in-lines, or almost every race, is a mass start,” said Mitchell Whitmore, who finished 10th in the 1,000 on Friday. “So it’s just second nature to him, strategy-wise.” American long-track speedskaters won numerous medals combined at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Games before being shut out at the Olympics four years ago in Sochi, Russia. Outside expectations seemed to have been lowered accordingly before these Games — for everything except the mass start. Mantia won gold in the mass start at the 2017 world championships here in Gangneung, and Bergsma finished with the bronze. One year later, they were ready to try again.",4482

It could be worn either way, which made it as versatile as Ledecka, who made history Saturday with her victory in the women’s snowboarding parallel slalom. Ledecka, who had won an Alpine skiing event, the women’s super-G, in an upset a week earlier, became the first woman to win a gold medal in two different sports in a single Winter Games. Not only did Ledecka defeat Selina Joerg of Germany in the final, she also nudged out Jorien ter Mors of the Netherlands, who had become the first woman to earn medals in different sports in a single Olympics while Ledecka waited to compete in snowboarding. Ter Mors earned gold in the 1,000 meters in long-track speedskating and added a bronze in the 3,000-meter relay in short-track. “I was dreaming about this moment since I was a little child,” said Ledecka, whose margin of victory in her six runs was at least four-tenths of a second. “A lot of people were telling me that it is not possible to do both sports and to be on a high level in both sports and today I proved it is possible.” Ter Mors and Ledecka, who was the first woman to compete in snowboarding and skiing in the same Olympics, nevertheless have upended the belief, propagated in modern-day youth sports in the United States and elsewhere, that early specialization is the one clear path to the Olympic podium. Ter Mors, 28, who also competed in the two sports at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, took up long-track skating as a cross-training exercise to improve her conditioning for short-track. Ledecka, 22, began skiing at age 2, tried snowboarding three years later, and loves both so much she said she never considered becoming a sports monogamist. When coaches counseled her to choose one or the other, she held her ground. She remained resolute even when her snowboarding coach, Justin Reiter, expressed his concerns last fall that she might hurt her snowboarding gold medal prospects if she chose to also compete in Alpine skiing. “I for sure want to win every race,” Ledecka said. “But the first thing is to enjoy and have good fun with what I’m doing with my sports.” Ledecka’s road to Pyeongchang contained no forks, just parallel tracks. With their distinct DNAs, skiing and snowboarding are snow sports’ fraternal, sometimes rival, twins. Being good at one does not mean the same in the other, as Lindsey Vonn, the three-time Olympic medalist in Alpine skiing, can readily attest. “I tried snowboarding once, and it did not go well,” she said. Vonn, 33, is heartened by the example that Ledecka is setting. She said she became a serious skier at age 13 by default. Vonn would like to be a multisport athlete, but her forays into tennis, figure skating, soccer and gymnastics were short-lived. “I’ve never really been good at anything but racing,” she said. A bronze medalist in the super-G at the 2010 Olympics, Vonn finished tied for sixth in the event last week. She was 38-hundredths of a second behind Ledecka, who came into the event ranked 43rd in the World Cup standings. Ledecka, racing in the 26th position, edged the defending Olympic champion, Austria’s Anna Veith, by a hundredth of a second, or roughly the length of a finger. After posting the fastest time in the downhill portion of the combined event five days later, Vonn joked that her time had a chance to hold up since there were no snowboarders in the field. “The millennials are raw and inclusive, and trying other sports is important to them, as it should be,” Vonn said. “I think maybe Ester can give them hope that competing and being successful in more than one sport is possible. I think she definitely will have a long-lasting impact.” Mikaela Shiffrin, a three-time Olympic medalist who races in each of the five Alpine disciplines, called Ledecka “an incredible example” for young athletes. “She didn’t just specify Alpine skiing in her sports repertoire when she was 8 years old because she wanted to be an Olympic champion,” Shiffrin said. “She was doing a lot of things. She can find the similarities between her sports and actually help build and improve with one sport off of the other.” Yet despite mounting evidence of the benefits of delaying specializing in one sport, Ledecka and Ter Mors might still be anomalies, whether it comes to women or men (The last man to earn medals in two sports at the same Winter Games was Heikki Hasu of Finland, in cross-country skiing and Nordic combined, in 1952.) Evidence abounds that athletes should not specialize until the teenage years, to minimize the risk of overuse injuries and emotional burnout. Felix McGrath, a 1988 United States Olympian in Alpine skiing, was a four-sport athlete in high school. “I love the fact that Ester is a multisport athlete,” McGrath said in an email from Norway, where he lives and coaches skiing. “I have many problems with what is going on with youth sports in general. In Norway and the U.S.A., specializing in one sport at a very young age — before 13 — has become common.” McGrath played soccer, tennis and golf during skiing’s off-season to maintain his connection to nature and to his fitness. Shiffrin sees other, less obvious benefits to Ledecka’s dual track. She spoke of the jaw-dropping lines that Ledecka carves on Alpine courses, a knack that Ledecka’s snowboarding coach, Reiter, attributes to her experience maneuvering on a snowboard, which, because it has no steadying or stabilizing poles, requires seeing a mountain in a more imaginative way. Shiffrin, 22, recalled a downhill training run in Lake Louise, Alberta, in November. Ledecka recorded the fastest time, she said, and “everybody stopped and jaws dropped, like that run isn’t supposed to be skied that way.” “It made everybody think about how much better we could all ski the course,” Shiffrin added. If there is a lesson to be learned from Ledecka’s success here, Reiter said, it is that the drive to specialize early, the better to achieve fame and fortune in sport, “should be redefined.” Michael Trapp, an American who trains with Ledecka in Colorado, said her passion, and persistence, more than her talent or versatility, is what sets her apart. “She’s the hardest-working athlete I’ve ever met,” Trapp said, adding that she will train in any conditions “and if she doesn’t come out with the fastest runs she’s mad about it. She acts like every day is a race day.” Trapp, 29, started out in all five snowboarding disciplines but was encouraged by his coaches to choose freestyle or racing. If he were a young child now, he might be inspired by Ledecka’s example “to try more disciplines and stick with more disciplines,” Trapp said. “Just with her and her resilience to say, ‘No, I want to do what I want to do.’ That’s kind of her motto.” The evolution of sports is driven by athletes whose unique vision opens everyone else’s eyes to what is possible. Ledecka is a throwback outlier, someone whose refusal to specialize has a back-to-the-future feel — and appeal. Shiffrin watched Ledecka’s super-G run and knew she was seeing something special. “I was screaming and crying when she came down and won that gold,” she said. Shiffrin added with a laugh, “I thought this sport was hard, but apparently not.”",7344
5a905abe410cf7000162da35,2018-02-23T18:17:29+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/baseball/brandon-drury-yankees-swing.html,Sports,"TAMPA, Fla. — When Phil Nevin was managing the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Class AAA team in Reno, Nev., in 2015, Brandon Drury spent so much time in the batting cages one day that the coaches kicked him out and told him to go home. They were not quite sure if he followed their directive. “There was a rumor the next day that he went down to the Family Fun Center and was putting quarters in the cages there,” Nevin said. The Yankees had tried to trade for Drury, whom they acquired Tuesday in a three-way trade, through three Diamondbacks general managers, but nobody in the Yankees’ organization knows him better than Nevin, the team’s new third-base coach. Drury will compete for the starting job at third base with Miguel Andujar, a 22-year-old prospect who the Yankees believe will develop into a star — but perhaps not this year. “Intensity,” Nevin said when asked what quality stood out about his few months working with Drury. “He’ll fit right into the room.” Drury flew here from Arizona on Wednesday, met Nevin for dinner that night — the coach picked up the tab — and went through workouts for the first time with his new teammates on Thursday, taking ground balls and batting practice. When he met with reporters on Thursday, he remarked several times that he was “pumped” about the trade. The Yankees were his favorite team growing up in Grants Pass, Ore., about an hour north of the California border, and he will have a chance to compete for a championship after getting a taste of the playoffs last season with the Diamondbacks. But most enticing is a return to third base — his natural position, but one that he played only once last season as the Diamondbacks’ Jake Lamb emerged as an All-Star at third. General Manager Brian Cashman, who gave up two prospects in the deal — second baseman Nick Solak went to Tampa Bay and pitcher Chris Widener to Arizona — relayed his scouts’ consensus when he spoke of Drury on Wednesday: Even though Drury played well the last two seasons in Arizona — he hit .275 with 29 homers and a .775 on-base-plus-slugging percentage — he was capable of more production. As it turns out, Drury, 25, feels the same way. “I don’t feel like I’ve done anything like what I’m capable of the last couple years,” said Drury, who is 6-foot-2, 210 pounds and hits right-handed. “They’ve both been kind of a grind. The numbers are O.K., I would say. But I don’t think that those last two seasons is half the player I am. I truly believe that. But then I have to go out and do it. That’s what I’m here for.” Drury’s reason for optimism is the changes he made to his swing over the winter. He drove from his off-season home in Las Vegas to the Los Angeles area about six times to work with the hitting coaches Craig Wallenbrock, Tim Laker and Robert Van Scoyoc, who have transformed the swings — and careers — of Boston’s J. D. Martinez, his former teammate in Arizona, and the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Chris Taylor. The idea: to turn some of the 37 doubles he hit last season — more than any Yankee, despite having only 445 at-bats — into home runs. “I’ll take a line drive up the middle all day,” Drury said. “But when I’m getting a 3-1 fastball or looking for a certain pitch, I don’t want that to be what I’m settling for. I want to drive the ball and be able to hit some home runs.” The changes have resulted in Drury’s getting the bat head into the hitting zone early and carrying it through longer so that he has greater margin for error, and also changing the plane of his swing, so it has an upward tilt, which he hopes will result in more fly balls that carry over the fence. “I didn’t understand how to hit certain pitches that I was trying to get,” Drury said. “I was just trying to get big with my swing, and that doesn’t work. It’s got to be your natural swing.”",3799
5a904d3e410cf7000162da02,2018-02-23T17:19:53+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/olympics-viral-online.html,Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Talya Minsberg The Olympic motto may be “higher, faster, stronger.” But the way the 2018 Pyeongchang Games have transpired it may as well be meh, nah, really? With only a couple of days left, the United States’ medal count of 21 is behind the 28 it won in the 2014 Sochi Games. NBC’s prime-time ratings are down, too, about 16 percent from four years ago, though according to Total Audience Delivery, NBC’s preferred measuring stick and the one it used to sell ads for the Games, viewership is only down 8 percent over all.  But another barometer could be telling, too, of the Olympics’ popularity: Most of the viral hits online from the Games, according to data from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, have little to do with athletic achievement. These heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the Olympics but now spread to a wider audience. Of the accounts that CrowdTangle tracks, some of the top Facebook posts (those that see lots of likes, comments, shares and clicks) from Feb. 9 to 21 included memes (a spoof of figure skating routines), a look at the synchronized drones from the opening ceremony, a video of a woman “practicing” the sport of curling with a Roomba and two trailers for “The Incredibles 2,” which premiered during the Games.  While the Roomba curler did indeed “hurry hard,” here are the other Olympians who managed to get a lot of attention, but perhaps not always in the way they intended.  Red Gerard and Chloe Kim, both 17, won gold medals. Gerard aced his slopestyle snowboard performance, becoming the youngest snowboarding gold medalist. Kim, who missed qualifying for the 2014 Olympics because she was too young, easily won the halfpipe snowboard competition.  But let’s just say they are also very much teenagers. Gerard stayed up late watching “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” on Netflix and slept through his alarm the day of his gold medal run. He called his morning “hectic.”  After winning the gold, he promptly let out an expletive heard on television. The internet found its first hero of the Games.  For her part, Kim did not finish her breakfast sandwich the morning of her event, tweeting she was “hangry” (a combination of hungry and angry) minutes before her gold medal performance.  According to Twitter, Kim had 15,000 followers before the tweet, and 100,000 new followers after it:  Neither the figure skater Adam Rippon nor the skier Gus Kenworthy was favored to win a gold medal before the Games. But both had garnered news media attention as openly gay, outspoken members of the American team. Before the American delegation entered the opening ceremony, which Vice President Mike Pence attended, Kenworthy tweeted:  It went viral.  Four days later, after winning a bronze medal in the figure skating team competition — and incurring the wrath of internet trolls — Rippon wrote on Twitter:  Another viral moment.  Rippon and Kenworthy then received the ultimate good-luck charm and another bump of social excitement: a tweet from Britney Spears.  Kenworthy had a disappointing 12th-place finish, but found his own shining moment. Unbeknown to him, cameras caught him kissing his boyfriend.  “That’s not something I had as a kid,” Kenworthy told the New York Times reporter Karen Crouse. “I didn’t see a gay athlete at the Olympics kissing their boyfriend. I think if I had it would have made it a lot easier for me.” In the men’s 15-kilometer cross-country race, Dario Cologna of Switzerland won the gold, Simen Hegstad Kruger of Norway took silver and Denis Spitsov, a Russian, earned the bronze.  But it was the last finishers — not the first — who created the race’s most memorable moment. They included Pita Taufatofua of Tonga, Sebastian Uprimny of Colombia and, por fin, German Madrazo of Mexico. Madrazo told reporters he had learned to ski only a year ago. Taufatofua skied on snow for the first time a few months before the Games.  The group lifted Madrazo on its shoulders when he crossed the finish line almost 26 minutes after Cologna won the race.  The underdogs instantly became fan favorites and a symbol of the Olympics, which posted a photo of Madrazo carrying the Mexican flag on its social media accounts, where it generated tens of thousands of likes.  When the halfpipe snowboard king Shaun White regained his Olympic crown, he also returned to the top of social. But not only for his performance.  According to CrowdTangle, four of the top 15 Instagram posts on the Olympics were posted by Shaun White. From Feb. 9 to 21, White was the most talked about athlete on Facebook, according to the company. (Facebook will release more complete data after the conclusion of the Games.) White was also the most mentioned athlete on Facebook during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, even though he failed to win a medal.  But the discussion this time was not all about White’s athletic achievements. On the heels of his gold medal performance, he was asked about past sexual harassment allegations. Those allegations, and his responses, kept him in the limelight online in the days after his win.  Advertisement",5246
5a90391b410cf7000162d9a6,2018-02-23T15:53:56+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-college-basketball.html,Sports,"Documents uncovered in a federal investigation indicate that college basketball players for several of the country’s most prominent programs — including Duke, North Carolina, Kentucky and Michigan State — received financial and other benefits that could violate N.C.A.A. rules, according to Yahoo Sports. The documents are believed to detail payments made to athletes through a sports agency that represents several top N.B.A. players. Christian Dawkins, a former employee of the agency, ASM Sports, is one of the defendants in the federal prosecutors’ case. Late Friday night, ESPN reported that the investigation had also produced 3,000 hours of wiretapped calls from Dawkins’s phone, in which one prominent head coach, Arizona’s Sean Miller, discussed paying a top recruit, the current Wildcats freshman DeAndre Ayton. A complaint released in September accused Dawkins of helping to facilitate payments from Adidas to a high school prospect to get the prospect to go to Louisville and later sign with Adidas. The prospect involved with the Louisville case, Brian Bowen, is named in the documents, which include a balance sheet from the end of 2015 listing loans to dozens of players, many of whom were in college. Other players identified in the documents include former college players like North Carolina State’s Dennis Smith Jr., Maryland’s Diamond Stone, Virginia’ Malcolm Brogdon and Washington’s Markelle Fultz, last year’s No. 1 overall N.B.A. draft pick, according to Yahoo Sports. Current players mentioned in the documents include the Michigan State sophomore Miles Bridges and the Duke freshman Wendell Carter Jr. The documents generally did not appear to indicate that the colleges were involved with or even knew of the payments. But late Friday night, Yahoo Sports reported that emails from Dawkins, which federal investigators had obtained, seemed to show him in contact with assistant coaches not only at Oklahoma State and Arizona — where two former assistants have been charged — but also at Indiana and Michigan State. Several schools said they were looking into the report and pledged full cooperation. Duke’s athletic director, Kevin White, said that Carter had no eligibility issues related to the report. Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo said that he had no reason to believe anyone in the program had committed violations. An Indiana spokesman told Yahoo Sports that he had not heard the allegation before. Miller, ASM Sports’s former president, was not one of the defendants in the federal cases, but he gave up his accreditation as an N.B.A. agent in December. The office of ASM Sports was raided in September, shortly after the complaints were released, and Miller’s computer was seized. Miller was a longtime agent whose past clients included stars like Kevin Garnett and Chauncey Billups. More recent clients included the Toronto Raptors’ Kyle Lowry (whose name appears in the documents) and the Knicks’ Kristaps Porzingis. In the schemes outlined by federal officials, top high school basketball players were virtually for sale to the highest bidder, namely, teams backed by shoe companies. The process required fake purchase orders, coaches’ assents — and, crucially, middlemen like youth-league coaches, money managers and agents. Dawkins, who was Miller’s employee, was a particularly eager facilitator, according to federal investigators. Dawkins’s lawyer was not immediately available to comment Friday. Dawkins argued in a court filing that the case against him wrongly depicted what might be N.C.A.A. violations as lawbreaking, saying that an indictment “seeks to criminalize purported violations of the rules of a private, voluntary association.” Earlier this week, three of the case’s 10 defendants, including Dawkins, lost on a motion to dismiss the case; they had contended that what they were accused of doing did not constitute a federal crime. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that an undercover agent who had worked the investigation had been accused of misappropriating funds, threatening his ability to serve as a witness. It is not clear how teams will respond to Friday’s report. Under N.C.A.A. rules, they are supposed to hold out players whom they suspect of being ineligible. Michigan State may feel compelled not to play Bridges, the Spartans’ best player, when it enters next week’s Big Ten tournament as a national title contender. The bracket for the N.C.A.A. tournament will be released in a little more than two weeks, with the games themselves commencing a few days later. It is unclear what impact Friday’s news will have on that event, perhaps the most prominent on the college sports calendar and the one that is indispensable to the N.C.A.A.’s finances. “These allegations, if true, point to systematic failures that must be fixed and fixed now if we want college sports in America,” Mark Emmert, president of the N.C.A.A., said in a statement released on Friday. In September, federal prosecutors in the United States Southern District of New York revealed three complaints painting a portrait of widespread corruption in the nebulous marketplace of college basketball recruiting. Four assistant coaches at high-major programs were said to have taken bribes in order to persuade players to sign with an agent or money manager upon reaching the N.B.A. In another complaint, unnamed coaches, an Adidas executive and others were accused of attempting to funnel money to recruits in exchange for their commitments to teams sponsored by Adidas and for pledges to sign with the apparel company later on. Prosecutors said the defendants had violated federal law. But it is also likely that, if the allegations are true, their programs would have violated N.C.A.A. rules, which bar teams from paying players beyond a scholarship and related costs; from offering recruits inducements beyond ones strictly delineated in the N.C.A.A. rule book; and from playing athletes who were ineligible because, for example, they accepted illicit money. The scandal cost several coaches their jobs and could affect the eligibility of current players. It also felled Rick Pitino, the Hall of Fame coach at Louisville, who according to someone familiar with the complaint was said to have spoken to the Adidas executive about securing the commitment of a top prospect. Pitino has vigorously denied any involvement or knowledge of the scheme. Last year, in response to the federal probe, Emmert convened an N.C.A.A. commission to examine men’s basketball. It is chaired by the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.",6578

A national crisis is at hand, except it has nothing to do with social services or education or income inequality. No, this is an issue that merits immediate action after a debacle on a global stage. We’re talking, of course, about curling. In an unprecedented flameout, the Canadian men’s and women’s curling teams were shut out of medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Two days after the women finished with a 4-5 record in pool play, which left them without any hope of contending for a spot on the podium, the men lost to Switzerland on Friday in the match to award the bronze medal. Fourth place! The only consolation for Canada? Gold in mixed doubles, a new event at the Olympics and one that some highly opinionated purists from curling hotbeds like Manitoba and Saskatchewan consider a diluted version of the sport. Yet after the Canadian men’s and women’s teams filled the past 10 days with light draws (curling talk for a bad shot), stones that flashed the house (curling talk for a different type of bad shot) and losses to teams like South Korea, Denmark and — perhaps worst of all — the United States, that gold in mixed doubles probably doesn’t look so shabby. It should be noted that Canada is a curling powerhouse. Historically speaking, it is a nation of broom-wielding, rock-shoving wizards. Their Olympic trials are the most competitive curling competition on the planet. Plus, the sport is played on ice, and Canada is pretty good at stuff that involves ice. Entering these Games, Canadians had never gone without a medal in any curling event since the sport made its debut at the 1998 Winter Olympics. They were 10 for 10, a stretch of dominance that included the last three gold medals in the men’s competition. So to do what they did here (or didn’t do here) would be comparable to the United States men’s and women’s basketball teams failing to win a medal at the Summer Olympics. But just as basketball has become a global sport, with improved competition from countries like Spain and Serbia, curling has benefited from increased popularity around the world. Consider the success of the South Korean women’s curling team at these Olympics — and the effect its surprisingly strong showing here will have on the continued growth of the game in Asia. On Friday, the South Koreans defeated Japan, 8-7, in a semifinal thriller to advance to Sunday’s gold medal final against Sweden. “It’s overplayed that Canada is a favorite,” the Canadian curler Marc Kennedy told reporters after the team’s loss to the Americans in Thursday’s semifinals. “We come from a rich history of curling, where we won everything, and that’s not the way it is anymore.” He added: “Anyone that’s been watching the grand slams of curling, we’ve got European teams winning all the time. They spend nine months of the year in Canada training and learning our strategies and using our coaching and using our ice. So this is the new normal. People need to get used to it.” Even if that takes some time.",3111

A cheerleader at a Russia hockey game.Credit Supported by Photographs and Text by James Hill They arrived for the opening ceremony dressed in pale gray coats, waving to the crowd and taking selfies as if to prove to themselves that they were really there, after all, at the Olympics.  In fact, 169 Olympic Athletes From Russia, as they are officially known, arrived in South Korea for the Pyeongchang Games. After the scandal over Russia’s state-controlled doping scheme at the 2014 Sochi Games, it seemed as if there would be no athletes from that country at all.  Watching them over the past two weeks has been to witness strange things. The letters OAR replaced RUS on outfits and uniforms as if some newly born nation were competing.  The Olympic flag has been shown next to the athletes’ names on television and also raised at medal ceremonies, though the tally of medals has been subdued because many of those who had won competitions in Sochi were absent because of doping accusations. Not until Day 14, with the victory of Alina Zagitova in the women’s figure skating, did Russia claim its first gold medal. The Russian supporters in the stands took it upon themselves to make up for the quasi anonymity of the athletes and to push back against the International Olympic Committee’s punishment. Some have come from relatively nearby cities of the Russian Far East such as Vladivostok, Magadan and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Others appear to be part of organized groups, arriving at the games with matching hats and shirts bearing the phrase, “Russia in My Heart,” a poke at the location of the flag missing on the athletes’ attire.  They have been particularly visible at the hockey games, where cheerleaders have whirled pom-poms and they have belted out Russian folk songs.  Another center of action for fans has been the country’s Sports House (it was prohibited from calling it Russia House), near the cluster of venues in coastal Gangneung. Gigantic Matryoshkas adorn the walls, Russian pop karaoke pumps up the atmosphere and fans gather to watch games on a giant screen.  The behavior of the athletes, however has been muted and they are visibly on edge. This week a Russian curler, Alexander Krushelnytsky, who had won bronze in the mixed doubles curling event, failed a doping test and left the Games. On Saturday, the International Olympic Committee is expected to announce whether the Russian delegation will be allowed to march at the closing ceremony with its national flag and its usual uniforms.

And happy to be doing so. This is the land where hockey rules, curling is coming up fast on the outside and cross-country skiing claims a prized niche in the state’s Scandinavian heritage. From Warroad, the little town near the Canadian border with a lengthy Olympic hockey heritage, to the Twin Cities and farther south, lights stayed on well into Thursday morning as the United States women’s hockey team, with seven Minnesotans on the roster, beat  Canada, 3-2, in a shootout for the gold medal to end 20 years of Olympic frustration. “We probably woke up the neighbors about 1:30 or 2 o’clock,” said Mark Manney, who coached goaltender Maddie Rooney on the Andover High School boys’ team. It capped a whirlwind 48 hours of Minnesota success at the Pyeongchang Olympics. It began with Lindsey Vonn, who learned to ski as Lindsey Kildow on the slopes of Buck Hill in the Minneapolis suburbs before moving to Colorado as a teenager, taking bronze in the women’s downhill. Then Jessie Diggins of Afton, east of St. Paul on the shore of the St. Croix River, won gold with Kikkan Randall in the team sprint. Theirs was the first medal by American women in cross-country skiing, and the first gold by an American in that discipline. And just a few hours after Rooney stopped Canada’s Meghan Agosta in the sixth round of a shootout to secure the hockey gold medal, the United States men’s curling team, led by John Shuster of Chisholm, up on northern Minnesota’s Iron Range, stunned Canada, 5-3, to advance to the gold medal game. That guaranteed the best finish by an American team in Olympic history. Given Shuster’s poor finishes at two previous Olympics (10th and ninth) and the 2-4 start by his team at this one, the unexpected run thrilled the Minnesota curling community, along with others who wouldn’t know a curling stone if they tripped over one. “Nobody brags on their own the way Minnesotans do,” said Manney, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force who flew Air Force One for six years under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and works in security at the high school. “If you go to other places, somebody famous might live down the street, and they never get talked about. Not here. We all know Jessie Diggins today.” That Minnesotans are leading American success in these sports should not be surprising. Minnesota produces more girls and women hockey players than any other state by far, according to U.S.A. Hockey, and the second-most curlers after Wisconsin, per U.S.A. Curling. And Minnesota, with a thriving cross-country community, is one of the few states where Nordic skiing is a varsity sport. Diggins won three state titles skiing for Stillwater High School. Her finishing kick in the team sprint mirrored her dramatic victory in the 2010 state championship, overcoming about a 10-meter deficit with 150 meters to go. The morning after her Olympic victory, when Ahvo Taipale, owner of Finn Sisu, a Nordic skiing outfitter in Lauderdale, Minn., opened his store, he replayed the final moments of Diggins’s race on a monitor over and over for customers. Some wouldn’t leave. “I told them, take all the time you want to watch the event,” said Taipale, who has known Diggins since she was 12. Taipale, originally from Finland, also spent part of the day needling Finnish coaches he knows by text. “I rub it in,” he said. The women’s hockey victory likewise thrilled folks in Warroad, a town of about 1,700 that has put eight hockey players on Olympic teams since 1960, including Gigi Marvin on the last three women’s teams. All but T.J. Oshie, in 2014, brought home medals. (Oshie can be forgiven; his four goals on six shots in an opening-round shootout against Russia still inspires awe.) Izzy’s Lounge and Grill, a popular local restaurant owned by Marvin’s uncle and aunt, stayed open late for a viewing party, drawing what owner David Marvin described as “not packed but a good crowd.” Marvin relied on Snapchat photos for that assessment because he wasn’t there. He also coaches the Warroad High girls team, which traveled seven hours by bus to St. Paul for the state high school tournament. Players watched the game in a couple of rooms at the team hotel, then crammed into one to celebrate the victory, Marvin said. Many know fellow Minnesotans like Lee Stecklein, Hannah Brandt and Dani Cameranesi as well as Gigi Marvin, once a Warroad High star and the granddaughter of the Warroad hockey icon Cal Marvin. “My team was just jacked up about it,” Marvin said Thursday morning, shortly after finishing a practice at a St. Paul municipal rink. “We had our best practice of the year today. “I texted Gigi before it started — you win the gold, and we’ll win the state tournament. She said, ‘You’re on.’ So we’ve got some work to do.” Just across the state border in Hudson, Wis., the 1998 women’s hockey gold medalist Karyn Bye Dietz watched the final minutes with her children, Tatum, 14, and Brody, 12. “My kids went to bed, but they both told me to wake them up,” said Bye Dietz. “It was exciting. It brought back so many memories. I knew exactly how they felt. Then they showed Canada, and Marie-Philip Poulin was crying uncontrollably. I’ve been there, too.” Dick Wicklund, curling manager of the Duluth Curling Club, where Shuster and his team practice, said about 35 hard-core fans gathered at the club at 5 a.m. Thursday for coffee and sweet rolls to watch a livestream of Shuster’s game. The club will hold a viewing party for the gold medal game early Saturday morning, he said. John Benton, a 2010 curling Olympian who manages the Four Seasons Club in Blaine, also skipped the hockey game after watching curling live at home Thursday morning, though he caught the hockey highlights later. A teammate of Shuster’s in 2010, Benton applauded Shuster’s determination to bounce back from two heavily criticized Olympic performances and lead his team to the brink of a gold medal. When Benton arrived at work Thursday, he said, the phone was “ringing off the hook” from people eager to learn how to curl, so much that Benton scheduled more time for lessons. Curling is booming all over the country, and especially here. As recently as 2010 there was only one curling club in the Twin Cities, in St. Paul. Now there are five, with a sixth set to open in June. Pete Fenson of Bemidji led, or skipped as it is known in the sport, the United States to a bronze medal in 2006. “We’ve spent a lot of time being a novelty,” he said. “Our niche has gotten pretty legitimized.”",6628
5a8ff96f410cf7000162d8ce,2018-02-23T11:22:20+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/olympics/russian-bobsledder-fails-doping-test.html,Sports,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — A second Russian athlete at the Pyeongchang Games, a female bobsledder, has failed a doping test. The result was revealed only hours before a decision was expected on whether to allow Russia to march with its flag at the closing ceremony Sunday. The athlete, Nadezhda Sergeeva, tested positive Friday for an unspecified performance-enhancing drug. The International Olympic Committee confirmed the failed test but did not name the athlete. The news came as anticipation grew over the I.O.C.’s plans to meet Saturday to decide whether to lift the suspension of Russia’s National Olympic Committee and allow its athletes to march with the Russian flag during Sunday’s closing ceremony. The reinstatement of the Russian delegation — banned for a state-orchestrated doping program that corrupted the 2014 Sochi Games in Russia — has presented a conundrum for the I.O.C., whose members disagree on how to handle the issue of the flag. The bobsledder’s failed test followed an earlier one that cost a Russian curling team their bronze medal. Danka Bartekova, one of the three members of a panel that will decide Russia’s fate before the closing ceremony, confirmed the group had met Friday. They are expected to present a report to the I.O.C.’s executive board late Saturday afternoon. Bartekova, a former Olympic skeet shooter from Slovakia, declined to comment on the failed test. A senior I.O.C. official who is aware of the panel’s thinking, said the members most likely would not take the new failed test into consideration because the process of evaluating the sample and confirming it contained a banned substance was not complete. The athlete, Sergeeva, also may have mitigating reasons for taking the substance. The official said under normal circumstances, the I.O.C. would not have learned about the failed test this soon; they know now only because Russian officials publicly revealed it. The official declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the drug test. In addition to the two Russian positives, two athletes from other countries have failed drug tests at the Games — a Japanese speedskater and Slovenian hockey player. The I.O.C. barred Russia from sending a delegation to the Winter Games, though 169 athletes were given special dispensation to compete as neutral athletes because they were able to prove to a special committee that they were clean. Yet the possibility that Sergeeva used a banned substance, and the earlier case of the Russian curler, most likely will amplify doubts about the vetting of cleared athletes. Alexander Krushelnytsky, who won a bronze in mixed doubles curling, subsequently left the Games and dropped his appeal. The head of Russia’s delegation in Pyeongchang told Sport Express, a Russian sports newspaper that broke the news of both failed tests, that the federation would conduct its own investigation into each one. “Unfortunately, this case speaks of the negligence shown by the athlete,” said Stanislav Pozdnyakov, the leader of the Olympic Athletes from Russia delegation. “I can say that she seriously let us all down.” The Russian Bobsled Federation president, Alexander Zubkov, told The Associated Press that Sergeeva had a clean test as recently as Feb. 13, and the banned substance was in a sample she provided five days later. He did not specify what was found, but he said he had spoken with Sergeeva. A follow-up test is usually done to confirm the results. Russia was hit by a suite of punishments for the unprecedented doping scheme on Dec. 5. Scores of athletes, coaches and officials were barred from the Games. The I.O.C. said it could welcome Russia back if it paid a $15 million fine and adheres to the global antidoping code. Russia confirmed it had paid the money Thursday. Until then, officials had said the fine would only be paid if it was clear the I.O.C. wouldn’t punish the country further. An I.O.C. executive board member, Ugur Erdener, who will be part of the group that will make the decision, declined to confirm the case. “I know some things, but I cannot tell you all the secrets,” he said.",4131

Yes, the Americans did it — they beat their rivals in the hardest of hard-fought finals. There may be little competition in women’s hockey outside the two final teams. But the Americans’ story line is even richer than this thrilling victory that was the pinnacle of the Pyeongchang Olympics for the United States, which is in danger of finishing these Games with its lowest medal count since 1998, back when the Games didn’t include many of the extreme sports in which Americans excel. Their victory meant so much more than just a puck flying into the net to end a tense shootout. “We all knew that this game was much bigger than just a game,” Duggan said. “It was on all of our minds going in.” Here’s why: Last March, the players threatened to boycott the world championships because negotiations with U.S.A. Hockey over equal pay and support hadn’t gone anywhere in more than a year. The women argued that they weren’t getting paid a living wage and that girls’ youth hockey was being overlooked by the federation, while money poured into the boys’ side of the game. The players also wanted policies for maternity leave and child care. There was a standoff. The federation began hunting for replacement players for worlds. The national team players began calling those potential replacements, asking them to take their side for the good of the game’s future — for all the women and little girls who hoped to be treated equally in the future. A lot was at stake. The world championships were being held in Michigan. An American boycott would have been a huge embarrassment. The players risked ruining their shot at these Olympics, and derailing their careers. But their effort resonated outside the sport. Billie Jean King lent her support, and so did a group of United States senators. No matter the consequences, the hockey players wouldn’t — and didn’t — back down. U.S.A. Hockey was forced to give up, and it was a pivotal moment in the history of women’s sports. “We bonded so much over it, and it brought us together,” Duggan said on Friday. “I don’t think we’d be here right now if we hadn’t stuck together.” Three days before the world championships last year, the players and the federation signed a new deal that provided athletes a salary of about $70,000 a year. That off-ice victory has given the players so many options now. They don’t have to quit the sport because they can’t support themselves. Before their new contract with U.S.A. Hockey, players were paid $6,000 in an Olympic year — and nothing in between Olympic years. Now the women don’t have to worry about their finances when making the decision of sticking with the game or not. Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, who scored the winning goal in the shootout, said she could now consider staying with the game because she still loved it and was still good at it. “To have that choice, I think means the world to us,” she said. To have a gold medal around their necks isn’t so bad either. When Lamoureux-Davidson scored in the sixth round of a tiebreaking shootout, her shot resonated throughout the sport. During Thursday night’s celebration, Duggan said she and her teammates watched video of the winning goal “a thousand times,” because as far as they were concerned, it was the most beautiful goal they’d ever seen in the history of hockey. With a couple of deft fakes and a whir of her stick, Lamoureux-Davidson sent the puck skittering past Canada’s goalie, giving the United States the 3-2 victory and their first Olympic gold medal since 1998. “I feel like the gold medal adds more credibility to what we’re trying to do with women’s sports in our country,” forward Hilary Knight said. “I’m not saying our voice or our skills are any less if we didn’t win. I just think more people start paying attention, and we’re 100 percent trying to inspire the next generation.” The team spent Friday being interviewed by reporters from morning until evening, and they could barely stop to breathe. Duggan told me that this whole year has been “for women’s hockey in America,” and so much more. “This is a moment for women in other sports and women in business and in every single walk of life,” she said. “We need to show our power and what women can do, so we can work more toward equality.” Thinking about that responsibility can be overwhelming, Knight said. She spent all night Thursday and all Friday thinking about the bigger picture of this Olympic victory. She thought about it so much, and celebrated it so much as she sipped Champagne and chatted with friends and family members, that she never even fell asleep Thursday night. Friday she kept her gold medal in the pocket of her Team U.S.A. jacket. She said she didn’t wear the medal because its ribbon pulls on her neck too much. It’s heavy. “You want to hold it?” she asked me, opening up my hand and placing the gold medal in my palm. And it was surprisingly heavy. About a pound and a quarter. “It’s so cool, right?” she said, explaining how she’d place it, safe and sound, next to her pillow Friday night. Maybe she will even get some sleep.",5492
5a8ff157410cf7000162d8b2,2018-02-23T10:47:46+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/sports/olympics/cross-country-skiing-food.html,Sports,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — For the cross-country skier Martin Moeller, the biggest challenge of his sport is not the freezing cold, the intense training or the grueling toll of competition. It’s eating. And eating. And eating again. “I actually do get tired of eating,” said Moeller, who lives in Greenland and skis for Denmark at the Olympics. “I always have to be thinking about what I will eat in two hours.” Few sports ask as much of the human body as cross-country skiing, which engages virtually every muscle group — legs, arms, abdominals, back — for hours at a time. One of the enduring images of the long-distance cross-country events is the sight of athletes collapsing at the finish line. That scene will no doubt repeat itself on this final weekend of the Pyeongchang Olympics as the men and women compete in their respective long-distance events — 50 kilometers for the men and 30 for the women. Skiers can train four to five hours a day at their peak, covering 60 kilometers or more and pushing their bodies to the limit. As a result, cross-country skiers, on average, also have the biggest fueling demands of any Olympic athletes — winter or summer. While other sports certainly have their big eaters (Michael Phelps was famous for his enormous meals, which were not typical for most swimmers), scientists say the effort to stay in calorie balance is most daunting for cross-country skiers. A typical elite cross-country skier will burn about 30 calories a minute during training — by comparison, a 155-pound person on an elliptical machine burns about 11 calories a minute. Research has shown that a typical male elite cross-country skier must consume 7,000 to 8,000 calories a day — more than three times the caloric needs of an average male — to meet the energy demands of the sport. Female elite skiers must eat about 3,500 to 4,000 calories a day — about double the calories consumed by the average woman. (A Swedish study found that during the hardest training days it can reach 8,126 for men and 4,780 for women — about double the calorie needs of Kenyan marathon runners.) What does it take to consume 8,000 calories — the equivalent of about 20 plates of lasagna or 40 scoops of ice cream — every day? For cross-country skiers, who often have slim builds and limited stomach capacity, it means eating several times a day, and often planning their schedules around their constant meals. Many have tricks to help them fuel — they eat mashed foods, high-calorie bars, calorie-laden sports drinks; they carry backpacks full of beef jerky and almonds, and they always take dessert. “I’m laughing about it and at myself because it feels normal,” said Caitlin Patterson, 28, an American skier who finished 34th out of 62 in the 15-kilometer women’s skiathlon. “It is something we think about a lot of the time,” she said, as she snacked on beef jerky after a workout at the Olympic cross-country center. “It’s an important part of your job because fueling is so important for your physical performance.” Patterson, who is 5-foot-9 and about 132 pounds, estimates she takes in up to 3,500 calories a day depending on her training level. Fueling starts with a breakfast of two eggs fried in butter topped with melted Vermont Cheddar, plus two pieces of toast with jam and no guilt. “It’s a good combination of the nutrients that I need to get through the training,” she said. After morning training she quickly eats about 300 calories in snacks — beef jerky, almonds, a few Fig Newtons and maybe an orange. She eats lunch when she gets home. A big salad with maple-mustard dressing, a grilled cheese sandwich or quesadillas, followed by a cookie or a bowl of Ben and Jerry’s milk and cookies ice cream. After a few hours rest, it’s time to start thinking about eating again for her afternoon training. Dr. Ola Ronsen, chief medical officer for the Norwegian Ski Federation, said that on many days the athletes simply cannot eat enough. Research has shown some may fall as much as 1,000 calories short of their body’s daily needs. As a result, it is important that they keep up the same eating routine on their days off to make up the deficit. The problem, said Ronsen, is that many athletes feel full before they have entirely replaced the energy loss of training. “When you train you take a lot of energy from the muscles,” he said. “But when you are replacing that, you’re using your stomach and gut to process the food before it’s brought back via circulation to your muscles. You’ve filled up your stomach, but feeling full is not always a reliable signal that it’s enough for the muscles to replace the glycogen.” Moeller says that eating is such a big part of his day that it can sometimes interfere with family time with his sons, ages 6 and 8. “My kids do say, ‘Do you have to eat again? Now?’” he said. “When you have to go out with the kids, I often say, ‘We have to wait. I have to eat.’” Moeller, who is six feet tall and about 176 pounds, says he trains four to five hours a day and takes in about 8,000 calories a day, following a rigorous eating schedule to get it all into his body. In addition to eating a large breakfast (fried eggs, oatmeal and white beans), lunch (pasta with meat sauce, pan-fried fish and salad) and dinner (double servings of whatever his family is eating), he eats two smaller pre-training meals, two small recovery meals and a small extra meal before bedtime (any combination of oatmeal, bread, cheese, ham, honey, sports drinks and sometimes cheesecake or chocolate cake or a doughnut if he wants it.) This summer, Moeller adjusted his diet to eliminate sugar and focus on only so-called “healthful’ foods. “I lost a little weight but I was not skiing faster — I was skiing slower,” he said. He decided to go back to eating whatever and whenever he felt like. “When you have to eat a lot, you have to eat the stuff you like to eat,” he said. “It’s not eating cake all the time of course. You need to eat all the healthy stuff. But it’s not good to say this is something I can’t eat. If you want a doughnut or a Coke, you get a lot of calories like that and you recover much faster. It’s better than eating less.” During weeks of strenuous training during the season, the athletes are pushing so hard that their bodies begin to release hormones that suppress appetite, making it an even bigger challenge to get the necessary nutrients. “If you come to a point where the training is so hard your desire to eat goes down, that’s a critical balance,” Ronsen said. “It’s a delicate situation. You really have to force yourself to eat even though you don’t feel like you are hungry anymore.” Susie Parker-Simmons, a senior nutritionist for the United States Olympic Committee, says that meeting the calorie demands of the sport can be especially challenging for women, who can lose their menstrual cycle and bone mineral density if their eating falls behind. “It’s just so hard to get that amount of calories in,” she said. During a team event in Switzerland, she worked with the athletes to help them fuel, recommending that they take in calorie-dense foods right after training like sports drinks and gels, Clif bars, smoothies and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. “They said, ‘If you come look after us we’ll just eat or drink what you give us,’” she said of the American skiers Linda Bakkman, a sports nutritionist with the Swedish Olympic Committee, said that even Olympic athletes must contend with cultural biases around eating high-calorie foods. “You can’t meet the energy requirement of being a cross-country skier with salad,” she said. “There is an educational challenge.” The Swedish cross-country skier Daniel Rickardsson, 35, who won Bronze in the 15-kilometer event in Sochi in 2014 and who will compete in the grueling 50 kilometer on Saturday, said that fuel is a constant need. During a race, which can last a few hours, he needs to consume about 100 grams of carbohydrates every 15 to 20 minutes. A crew member hands him a high-concentrate sports drink at regular intervals on the course. It helps that he spends time with teammates who also eat three regular meals each day (porridge, cheese and meat sandwiches, quinoa, tuna, chicken, vegetables) plus six small meals including one before bedtime (high-protein yogurt, banana, eggs, cheese sandwiches.) “It’s breakfast, training, lunch, rest, eating, training, eating and rest and eating,” Rickardsson said. “It’s what we do.” For Moeller of Denmark, who finished about six minutes behind the winner in the men’s 15-kilometer freestyle cross-country event, Pyeongchang is likely to be his last international competition, although he still plans to continue skiing and to run marathons. “But I’m looking forward to relaxing and not training so much,” he said. “And I’ll eat a lot less.”",8811

Grabner has 25 goals and six assists in 59 games this season, and the trade makes him the 12th player to spend time with the Rangers, the Islanders and the Devils. The Rangers received a second-round draft pick in the June draft and defenseman Yegor Rykov, 20, from the Devils, who are currently in playoff position, 11 points ahead of the Rangers in the Metropolitan Division. It is the first trade between the Rangers and the Devils since the Colorado Rockies moved to New Jersey and became the Devils in 1982. The last trade between the franchises came in November 1979, when the Rangers acquired defenseman Barry Beck from the Rockies for five players. Grabner scored 27 goals for the Rangers last season after they signed him to a two-year, $3.3 million contract. He can become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. Grabner, a 30-year-old Austrian, has also played for Vancouver and Toronto during his nine-year N.H.L. career. He scored a career-best 34 goals for the Islanders in 2010-11. The trade is the second this week for the Rangers; they sent defenseman Nick Holden to the Boston Bruins for defenseman Rob O’Gara and a 2018 third-round draft pick. The Rangers have lost five straight games, and 12 of their last 15, falling into last place in their division. They have missed the playoffs only once in the last 12 seasons, and the lone absence came down to the last day of the 2009-10 regular season. Grabner and his fellow forward Rick Nash were scratched from the Rangers’ lineup for Thursday’s 3-1 loss at Montreal, fueling speculation that trades might be near. Nash, who also will be an unrestricted free agent after the season, is expected to be traded before Monday’s deadline. Nash, 33, has 18 goals and 10 assists in 60 games this season. He scored a career-best 42 goals in the 2014-15 season. He is in the final year of an eight-year, $62.4 million contract that he signed with the Columbus Blue Jackets, who traded him to the Rangers in July 2012. Ryan McDonagh, the Rangers’ captain who has not played since a 6-1 loss to Boston on Feb. 7 because of an upper-body injury, has also been mentioned in trade speculation. His contract will expire after next season. The Rangers host Minnesota on Friday and Detroit on Sunday before leaving for a trip to Western Canada after Monday’s deadline.",2488
5a8f5969410cf7000162d756,2018-02-22T23:59:33+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/sports/tennis/eugenie-bouchard-usta-lawsuit.html,Sports,"After less than an hour of deliberation Thursday evening, a jury ruled in favor of Eugenie Bouchard in her lawsuit against the United States Tennis Association, finding that the organization’s negligence helped lead to her fall in a trainers’ room at the United States Open in 2015. Bouchard slipped on a cleaning substance that had been applied to the room’s tile floor and sustained a concussion that forced her to withdraw from the tournament. She did not play a complete match for the rest of that season. She is seeking damages for her physical and emotional suffering in the lawsuit, which lasted nearly two and a half years, as well as lost earnings on and off the court. In some relief to the U.S.T.A., the jury found that Bouchard was responsible for 25 percent of the total negligence. The U.S.T.A., then, will only have to pay 75 percent of the damages owed to Bouchard. “When you get 75 percent or better, you can’t ever complain about that,” Benedict Morelli, Bouchard’s lawyer, told reporters after the decision. The damages phase of the trial will begin Friday at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to determine how much the injury cost Bouchard. Morelli said he did not yet have an exact figure in mind, but he indicated that he expected to request millions of dollars in damages, to recoup “all the different revenue that she lost.” The liability phase of the trial focused strictly on the cause of Bouchard’s injury, rather than its effects. She fell out of the top 100 of the WTA singles rankings for the first time in nearly five years last month; her current ranking is 116th. Though she returned to the tour full-time at the beginning of the 2016 season, she has not progressed past the third round in any of the nine Grand Slam events since she sustained the concussion. Bouchard, however, had struggled before the accident, as well. In the months leading up to the 2015 Open, her ranking slid from No. 6 to 25th, and she had won just three of her previous 18 matches leading up to the Open. Morelli suggested to reporters that he would dismiss that slide as “a sophomore slump” in the trial’s next phase. Her breakout year was in 2014, when she reached the final at Wimbledon and her ranking climbed to No. 7. After testimony from Bouchard, the U.S. Open tournament director David Brewer and three locker room attendants on the first two days of the trial, the lone witness on Thursday was Kristy Stahr, who was a WTA trainer during the 2015 tournament in Queens. Bouchard said in court that she had told Stahr that she intended to take an ice bath after her post-match obligations the night of her fall, but all of the WTA trainers had left for the night before Bouchard returned to the room. Players must pass through the trainers’ room at the U.S. Open to reach the ice baths. “We just assumed that she had left,” Stahr said. Stahr, the lone witness called by the defense, refuted assertions from Bouchard’s testimony that trainers “encourage” players to enter the room without a trainer present. “Absolutely not,” Stahr said. Under cross-examination by Adam Deutsch, a lawyer for Bouchard, Stahr conceded that players often enter the room by themselves to complete certain simple tasks, such as filling a bag with ice. Another trainer, Eva Scheumann, sent an email to Bouchard telling her that trainers had left for the night but could “turn back” if she still needed anything. Deutsch contended that “turn back” meant that the trainers were aware that Bouchard was still at the tournament when the cleaning substance was applied. The U.S.T.A. agreed during the trial that trainers were supposed to begin cleaning the floors only after all players had left for the night. The U.S.T.A.’s chief locker room attendant, Karen Owens, said that trainers saying “good night” for the evening indicated to her that all players had left, and that the floor could be cleaned. “She didn’t abide by the rules,” Morelli said of Owens in his closing argument. “And, therefore, the accident happened.” Alan Kaminsky, a lawyer for the U.S.T.A., representing the tennis association, said in his closing argument that the same practices had been followed on that night as on any other. “If we were negligent that day, we were negligent every day for 30 years,” Kaminsky said. “The U.S.T.A. doesn’t have to be perfect; we just have to be reasonable.” Kaminsky seemed open to a ruling of shared negligence between the U.S.T.A. and Bouchard in his closing remarks, saying that he thought she bore a “majority” of responsibility.",4569
5a8f5956410cf7000162d754,2018-02-22T23:59:11+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/sports/olympics/womens-figure-skating.html,Sports,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Technically, Russia did not win its first gold medal at these Winter Olympics on Friday. Strictly speaking, Alina Zagitova, the 15-year-old victor in women’s figure skating, competed as a neutral “Olympic Athlete From Russia.” At a medal ceremony later Friday, she watched the five-ringed Olympic flag being raised instead of the Russian flag and heard the Olympic hymn played instead of the Russian anthem. But a nominal banning of Russia from the Olympics for operating a systematic doping scheme at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi was more of a semantic prohibition than a complete ban. One hundred sixty-nine Russian athletes were permitted to compete here. And there was no question which country Zagitova represented in winning gold with a score of 239.57 points as fans chanted her name and waved the Russian tricolor. Her friend and training partner, Evgenia Medvedeva, took the silver medal with 238.26 points while skating as Tolstoy’s tragic Anna Karenina. (Kaetlyn Osmond of Canada won the bronze with 231.02 points, while no American placed higher than ninth out of 24 competitors, the worst collective finish by American women at the Olympics.) Before the medal ceremony, Zagitova declined to say whether she would be disappointed not to see the Russian flag, but Medvedeva said: “It doesn’t matter what the circumstances are. People know who we are. Today, we proved ourselves here.” A two-time world champion and consensus favorite to win gold before she broke a bone in her right foot last fall, Medvedeva was forced to confront a sobering reality on Friday at age 18: Experience and artistry and expressiveness did not prevail over mathematics. Zagitova became the second-youngest women’s skater to win Olympic gold with a program of shrewd design, remarkable stamina, precise jumping and youthful certainty. What she lacked in the full elegance that comes with maturity, Zagitova compensated for with a keen understanding of skating’s current rules. In her balletic “Don Quixote” routine, she landed all 11 of her jumps in the second half of her four-minute free skate, compared to eight for Medvedeva. This is known as back loading, and is meant to gobble up a 10 percent bonus awarded for each jump beyond the halfway point of a routine, as skaters’ legs begin to tire. With calm under pressure and endurance gained from her strenuous training, Zagitova placed a triple loop worth 5.65 points onto her second triple lutz, rescuing a combination jump that she could not complete after a heavy landing on her first lutz. Some find the beginning of Zagitova’s routine — limited to spins, footwork and choreography — to be a tedious preamble. Zagitova defended the design of the routine, saying, “It captivates the audience and makes them watch to the very end.” A year ago, Zagitova was the world junior champion, while Medvedeva was the senior world champion favored to win Olympic gold. Then Medvedeva broke a bone in her right foot last fall, missed training time and two important competitions and perhaps never fully regaining her stamina. Zagitova at the same time came into her own, defeating Medvedeva at the European championships last month and now at the Olympics. “It’s life and it’s a lesson,” Medvedeva said of being surpassed by a younger skater. “Every year, every moment, every day, every week, every month, we must become stronger.” Zagitova has sometimes clashed with Eteri Tutberidze, who coaches her and Medvedeva in Moscow. Several years ago, Zagitova admitted she trained indifferently and nearly quit. But now she skates with a seriousness of purpose and a whispery inevitability. At practice on Thursday, Zagitova landed five triple jumps in a matter of seconds. The skating world saw a similar Olympic performance 20 years ago. At the 1998 Winter Games, Michelle Kwan of the United States was widely favored to win a gold medal. But Tara Lipinski, then 15, entered those Olympics as the world champion and skated with a technical mastery and joyous inevitability while Kwan displayed the slightest caution. Lipinski won and remains the youngest Olympic champion by a few weeks at a comparable age to Zagitova. “She was literally a junior last year; it’s even hard for me to understand that,” Lipinski said of Zagitova. “What sets her apart is she has this fearlessness and the technical brilliance. I think she knows in a confident way that she’s the best.” Women’s skating in the United States — once dominant — continues to edge toward irrelevance at major international competitions. Bradie Tennell finished ninth, Mirai Nagasu was 10th and Karen Chen 11th. No American woman has won an Olympic medal since 2006 and only one has won a medal at the annual world championships. Lipinski has criticized American officials for not adjusting to the current scoring system, which rewards the most difficult jumps. George Rossano, the editor of the website Ice Skating International, said, “The timeline for developing U.S. skaters is four years slower than the rest of the world.” If a skater does not have triple-triple combination jumps by age 14, he said, “You’ve missed the boat to be a world-level competitor.” The Russians were behind, too, once. During the Soviet era, women’s skating produced only a single Olympic bronze medal. The prevailing theory is that the top skaters were placed into pairs, an event which the Soviets and Russians long dominated until recent Games. But Friday’s victory by Zagitova was the second consecutive gold medal won by Russian women, who operate in a centralized training system in which the top skaters challenge each other daily in practice. After the Soviet Union fell, a number of rinks closed and some top coaches moved to the United States. But there are dozens of rinks in Moscow now, some private, some state-operated. Many of the top women’s skaters are funneled to Tutberidze. “I would say that the girl who is beyond the top 10 is just as strong as the top three in the world,” Tutberidze said in an interview in Moscow in October. According to Evgeni Plushenko, the 2006 men’s Olympic champion who now has a skating club in Moscow, there are about 15 Russian girls who can land four-revolution jumps. At a competition in Russia this week, one of Tutberidze’s junior skaters, Alexandra Trusova, 13, boldly attempted two quads in her routine, landing a quad salchow and falling on a quad toe. Russia is not without its own issues, including the health of its young stars. Adelina Sotnikova, the 2014 Olympic champion at age 17, is not competing this season because of an injury. Yulia Lipnitskaya, who won gold at 15 in the team competition in 2014, has retired after battling anorexia. Medvedeva’s Olympic season was disrupted by the broken bone in her foot. “It is a concern,” Alexander Lakernik, a Russian who is vice president of the International Skating Union, said in a recent interview. But it is a concern for another day. For now, Russia is celebrating its first champion at these Olympics. Officially, as a team, its athletes are stateless, competing under a neutral flag. But a gold medal is still a gold medal.",7141
5a8f2f63410cf7000162d6dd,2018-02-22T21:00:14+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/sports/olympics/figure-skating-flower-kids.html,Sports,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea — A group of young skaters have wowed the crowds here with their speed and agility on the ice at the Olympic figure skating venue. But they aren’t competing. The skaters stealing the show are known as the flower kids, a team of 17 purple-clad South Korean children in charge of collecting the hundreds of toys, bouquets and other items that the crowds toss from the stands to their favorite Olympic figure skaters on the ice. The mostly female crew (there is only one boy) was recruited from competitive ice skating programs around South Korea. The flower kids, also called sweepers, stand out not only for their matching lavender outfits — color coordinated with the rink’s purple Zambonis — but also for their quickness and skill navigating the ice. During competitions, the sweepers sit in a group at the edge of the rink, clapping to the music and cheering the athletes. As soon as a figure skater finishes a routine, the sweepers zip onto the ice, scoop up any items tossed by fans and quickly race back to the edge, where the items are bagged for the skater. The job can be tricky. On Wednesday during the women’s short program, a flower girl racing off the ice had to dodge the American skater Mirai Nagasu, who was warming up but had stopped suddenly to check her skate boot. The men’s competition was particularly challenging this year, as fans of the Japanese gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu threw hundreds of Winnie the Pooh plush toys to the ice. With less than three minutes between skaters to collect the torrent of toys, the sweepers could barely keep up, grabbing bears and stuffing them into several large plastic bags as more toys rained down on them. One flower girl, Chaeju Yeon, 11, was hit by a flying Pooh toy hurled from the stands. “I just laughed,” she said through an interpreter. “It’s fun to pick up the presents.” Surin Lee, 12, said she once slipped and fell after hitting a patch of uneven ice while collecting toys. Such mishaps are worth it to see her favorite athletes, like the American skater Nathan Chen, up close, she said. Scott Hamilton, an Olympic gold medalist and NBC figure skating analyst, said that while skating fans find the flower kids adorable, they also serve an important role in making sure the athletes get to skate on clear ice. Hamilton remembers skating at the 1980 World Championships after fans of Robin Cousins tossed roses and bouquets to the ice. “It wasn’t a skating rink — it was a minefield,” he said. Hamilton said that it is better now that fans mostly throw plush toys, which are easier to collect than flowers and do not leave behind petals, leaves or other debris. “It’s a joy to see these kids,” Hamilton said. “I love them. They all have dreams of being great competitive skaters. It’s an honor for them to be able to grace the same ice as their heroes.”",2845
5a8f1d22410cf7000162d6ba,2018-02-22T19:42:19+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/sports/baseball/boston-red-sox-alex-cora.html,Sports,"FORT MYERS, Fla. — After reaching the playoffs last October, a glamour team in the American League East replaced the manager who won the club’s last championship. The choice was someone who had never managed in the majors, but had played for the team in the World Series. He was in his 40s, with a college education. He had recent experience as an ESPN analyst, and a brother who also played in the majors. All of that applied to the Yankees and Aaron Boone. It also applied to the Boston Red Sox and Alex Cora. Just as both teams have a new right-handed slugger in the middle of their lineups — Giancarlo Stanton for the Yankees, J. D. Martinez for the Red Sox — they also have managers with strikingly similar backgrounds. “You have to have such a multitude of skills for that job, and the more experiences you can have in different areas is extremely important,” said Dave Dombrowski, Boston’s president of baseball operations. “Guys with that type of background — when they’ve played in the World Series, been around the game their whole lives, when they have leadership skills, when they can communicate well — I think that gives them a much better opportunity to be successful.” Like the Yankees with Joe Girardi, the Red Sox had succeeded with John Farrell, who won a championship in 2013 and division titles the last two years. But last season was oddly joyless for many of the players, who acknowledged this as they reported to spring training. The Red Sox missed the presence of David Ortiz, the retired designated hitter, and Torey Lovullo, the bench coach who left to manage the Arizona Diamondbacks. Controversies festered, and Dustin Pedroia, the veteran second baseman, said players wasted too much emotional energy fretting over each day’s result. Sometimes Pedroia would reach out to Cora, who had dressed in the next locker as a fellow Red Sox infielder in Pedroia’s first three seasons, from 2006 to 2008. “Everything I do in baseball, he showed me how to do,” Pedroia said. But Cora could not help his friend last season. He had left ESPN to be the Houston Astros’ bench coach, and in that job, he said, it would not have been appropriate to counsel a member of another team. Now it is Cora’s job, officially, to help Pedroia and the Red Sox maintain and enhance their winning ways. Pedroia said Cora’s perspective was exactly what the players needed. “He always said if you’re a .300 hitter and the last day of the year you’re hitting .270, you’ll probably play a 30-inning game and go 30-for-30,” Pedroia said. “You are who you are. You’ve just got to fix the process and understand that in the end, you’ll be right where you need to be.” The Red Sox and the Yankees lost to Cora’s Astros in the playoffs last fall, but the Yankees got much farther, reaching Game 7 of the A.L. Championship Series. Cora said he learned a lot from the Astros and their manager, A. J. Hinch, mostly about the need for cohesion throughout an organization. “The most important thing is you have to connect,” Cora said. “The baseball operations, the analytics department, the medical staff — if they don’t get together, what’s the point? How are we going to filter the information from these departments to the coaches and to the players? If you can’t accomplish that, then you’re in trouble.” Read that again. In four sentences, Cora distilled the most important task for the modern manager. All teams use analytics to help guide in-game strategy, and managers must clearly communicate that vision to players. Like Boone, Cora worked closely with statisticians at ESPN and came to value their expertise. His lineage gives him a seasoned sensibility — Cora was 11 when his brother, Joey, reached the majors — but his television work helped him appreciate baseball through another lens. “This is where the game has gone, and there’s more acceptance from us, because we see it,” said the former major leaguer Eduardo Perez, the son of the Hall of Famer Tony Perez, who worked with Cora at ESPN and coached for the Astros in 2013. “When they started to implement a lot of analytics, people thought, ‘What are they doing?’” he continued. “But that was the beginning of where the Astros ended up, as world champions, and Alex had a taste of that last year. When you’re able to accept it and interpret it and use it on the field, you can get those players to believe in it, too.” Cora is 42; he was born on the original date of the fabled Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, before rainouts pushed it back. He played in the majors from 1998 to 2011, winning a championship ring with Boston in 2007. He is 13 years younger than Farrell, an even bigger age gap than the one between Girardi and Boone. (Girardi is 53, and Boone turns 45 in March.) Dombrowski was careful not to criticize Farrell, citing his achievements in Boston. But he added: “I think we needed a different voice, a younger voice, a connectivity voice between the manager and the players, with everybody. We have a lot of young guys, and the ability to connect even deeper than what we did in the past, in the clubhouse, I think is important.” Young managers are nothing new, even in Boston. Joe Cronin, a longtime player-manager, was 39 when he guided the Red Sox to the 1946 World Series. Dick Williams was 38 when he did so in 1967. Both are in the Hall of Fame. So is Tony La Russa, now a special assistant to Dombrowski, who will be available as a resource for Cora. (He also will have a veteran bench coach in Ron Roenicke, the former Milwaukee Brewers manager.) La Russa got his first major league managing job at 34, with the 1979 Chicago White Sox. He survived, he said, by following the advice of a team executive, Paul Richards: “Trust your gut and don’t cover your butt.” La Russa said he believed in Cora, Boone and others in that mold. “It’s high-profile and people are paying attention, so that’s an obstacle to overcome,” La Russa said. “But if you’ve got an open mind and your instincts are good, that, to me, is why I would bet on these young guys, that they’ll make it. Their gut, based on their experiences, is going to carry them, and they’ll just get better and better.” Hinch saw progress in Cora throughout last season. At the start, he said, Cora was mainly a liaison to players, and helped with infield positioning. As the season went on, he expanded his role to revamp the Astros’ base running and scout pitchers’ tendencies. In the postseason, Hinch said, Cora was vital to his in-game decision-making. “When you see him interact with players and you see the buy-in that he gets, it’s very easy to see why he was a good teammate, and why he’s beloved around the league,” Hinch said. “And he has such a great baseball mind, he’s ahead of the inning the game is in. He can see all the things a manager would.” The task now is to hold off the Yankees in the division, and then try to unseat the Astros. Martinez will boost a lineup that had the fewest homers in the A.L. last season, and the Red Sox expect more from starter David Price, who missed most of last season with elbow trouble. Cora said he would emphasize defense and base running. The Red Sox made 81 outs on the bases last season, easily the most in the majors. “We can make adjustments defensively, moving people around, putting guys in spots where they can make plays,” he said. “I felt like last year they played it pretty straight. So that, and base running. Very irresponsible running the bases. That’s something we have to do a better job of this year.” Cora has already made a difference in one vital area. When he negotiated his Red Sox deal, he asked the team to sponsor a mission trip to his native Puerto Rico. Just before spring training, pitchers Chris Sale and Rick Porcello joined Cora and others — including Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh — to deliver nearly 10 tons of supplies to aid in the island’s recovery from Hurricane Maria. The team and its foundation also donated $200,000 to help restore power to Caguas, Cora’s hometown. “I always said I wanted to do something impactful in baseball when I retire,” said Cora, who is off to an encouraging start.",8119
5a8f0111410cf7000162d661,2018-02-22T17:42:31+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/sports/olympics/russia-team-athletes.html,Sports,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — The first time that “Olympiakos Ymnos,” or the Olympic hymn, was played in front of a large audience, in Athens in 1896, the Greek composer Spyridon Samaras conducted a massive orchestra and a large choir in a performance of the song he had written. “When the trumpet gave the signal and Samaras, a chubby fellow, lifted his baton,” another Greek composer recalled, “the Olympic hymn with those grandiose chords vibrated the national string in the souls of the myriad spectators who have filled the stadium and with national pride clapped maniacally the resurgence of the ancient Olympic Games.” The song has not stirred such passion since. And it probably will not do so when it is used as an audible stand-in for the Russian national anthem at the Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea. It might just stir confusion. The Russians, caught in a doping scandal, were stripped of key identifying markers at these Winter Games, such as their national uniforms and their flag. And their anthem. So when a Russian athlete wins a gold medal — that will probably happen for the first time at the Pyeongchang Games in women’s figure skating — the Olympic flag of five interlocking rings will be raised to the rafters to the mostly unfamiliar strains of Samaras’s Olympic hymn. “It’s not a bad piece of music,” said William Guegold, a retired music professor from the University of Akron and the author of “100 Years of Olympic Music,” published in 1996. “It’s just not something that has wide public appeal to it or would be a popular piece in any way.” A faithful few might recognize it as the official anthem, or hymn, of the Olympics. It is traditionally played at the opening and closing ceremonies, and is somewhat forgettable. The women’s figure skating final is Friday here; Thursday night on the East Coast. The Russian skaters Alina Zagitova, 15, and Evgenia Medvedeva, 18, are the consensus choices to win gold and silver. Whenever the Olympic hymn is played, for one of them or any other athlete from Russia, it will not be the first time that the song was used in place of a national anthem. In 1992, for example, gold medal winners from the Unified Team, consisting of athletes from the recently fractured Soviet Union, were feted with the Olympic hymn. They watched as the Olympic flag was raised to the rafters to the sound of a little-known Greek composer’s song, sapping the usual emotion from the proceedings. That, apparently, is the point of banning the Russian anthem — to take away a bit of the national pride in the accomplishment of winning a gold medal. The unintended consequence: more Samaras. Born in 1861, Samaras was Greece’s most famous composer when the ancient idea of the Olympics was rebooted in Athens in 1896. He had moved to Paris, then to Italy, where he built a reputation for operas in the style of a contemporary, Giacomo Puccini. Samaras accepted an offer to write a hymn for the Olympics, certainly unaware it would be the most lasting part of his legacy. (One measure? Spotify’s library includes one song from Samaras: Olympic Hymn.) “These were the reconstituted Games by Pierre de Coubertin, designed to be competitions of the body, mind and spirit — this uplifting, Greek, heroic ideal,” Guegold said. “So they wanted a piece that exhibited that.” What the Olympics got was a romantic, accessible piece, with lots of brass and drums, and a softer middle section wrapped around a poem written by Kostis Palamas, another Greek, and dripping in schmaltzy grandeur. The style set the tone for future Olympic songs, including “Bugler’s Dream,” by Leo Arnaud, known widely to American television audiences, and John Williams’s “Olympic Fanfare and Theme,” from the 1984 Los Angeles Games. (Those two, sometimes clumsily stitched together, are still used on NBC’s Olympic telecasts.) “The beginning is very much a fanfare,” Guegold said. “The trumpets blowing the call, getting everybody to come together. It has that sort of rhythmic quality, musical triplets and fanfare devices.” The middle section of praises is sung by choirs, including the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics, often with Palamas’s words translated into the local language. In 1988, at the Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, they were sung in Korean. “Then the end has a nice big splash again,” Guegold said. “It grows, gets louder, and has a strong finish to it in terms of its grandeur.” Some renditions last about four minutes. Shortened versions, usually little more than a minute, are used when called upon for medal ceremonies. Samaras’s most famous composition nearly died in obscurity, resurrected only after decades in a coma. (He placed it in a 1908 opera of his as an overture, but that did not do much to add to its popularity at the time.) After Athens, subsequent Olympic host cities sometimes commissioned their own songs, a string of one-hit wonders. It was not until Richard Strauss composed a piece for the 1936 Summer Games in Berlin that the International Olympic Committee became smitten with the idea of a single, official anthem. It granted the status to Strauss’s hymn. It did not last. World War II came and the Olympics were suspended until 1948, when they were held in London. England was not about to play a German song as an official Olympic anthem. (Germany, along with Japan, was not invited to participate.) The English found their own hymn, as the Finns did for the 1952 Summer Games in Helsinki. The Olympic committee still wanted a permanent hymn. A contest was created in 1954, giving candidates less than a year to create a full orchestral score (vocal optional) of three to four minutes. A jury would select the winner. There were 392 entries. The winner was “an ultramodern atonal work,” according to the Historical Dictionary of the Olympic Movement, that was submitted by a Polish composer named Michael Spisak. As with the work of Samaras and Strauss, Spisak’s song did not last more than one Olympic cycle. “It was never terribly popular,” the authors of the Olympic dictionary wrote, “and Spisak’s demands for excessive royalties resulted in it not being chosen as the official Olympic anthem.” In a history of the anthem written for the International Society of Olympic Historians, Philip Barker noted the lingering desire for a singular anthem. “In the highly politicized Cold War atmosphere of the 1950s, the Olympic anthem was often suggested as a way of defusing excessive nationalism,” Barker wrote. A Greek member of the Olympic committee saw an opportunity to rekindle interest in Samaras’s original score. He nudged a Japanese counterpart before committee meetings in Tokyo in 1958, and an orchestra played the song from 1896. Members hastily adopted it as the official anthem in time for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, and it has remained that way since. Samaras never knew. He died in 1917. Host countries still like to add their own songs to the mix at the opening and closing ceremonies (that’s where Williams’s Olympic song came from, in 1984) but with little lasting effect beyond a footnote to sports history. Only one song, besides the national anthems — and, in this case, in place of a national anthem — is heard at every Olympics. “The Olympics is an organization that likes tradition,” Guegold said. “Once they set something in motion and it settles in, it lasts. I don’t foresee a time where they say, ‘O.K., now we need something different.’ I think we’re going to have it for quite a long time.” That might be music to the ears of Greeks, though there are only a few of them competing in South Korea. Mostly, depending on the athletic success of the Russians, it could be music — vaguely familiar, sometimes out of time and place — to the ears of everyone else.",7790

 Tay said terrible things. She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology. Let loose on the internet nearly two years ago, Tay was an experimental system built by Microsoft. She was designed to chat with digital hipsters in breezy, sometimes irreverent lingo, and American netizens quickly realized they could coax her into spewing vile and offensive language. This was largely the result of a simple design flaw — Tay was programmed to repeat what was said to her — but the damage was done. Within hours, Microsoft shut her down for good. Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free — at least for now. These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations. If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. “Ouch, that’s not good,” it might say. “Hope your ankle feels better soon.” If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways. Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company’s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man — unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply. Microsoft’s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. “It is a problem if we can’t get this in front of real users — and have them tell us what is right and what isn’t,” said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan. But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints — and bad press — Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet. The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines — easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation. For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted “chatbots” that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries. Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing. “It is more powerful,” said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook’s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. “But it is more dangerous.” The new breed relies on “neural networks,” complex algorithms that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large pools of data. Over the last five years, these algorithms have accelerated the evolution of systems that can automatically recognize faces and objects, identify commands spoken into smartphones, and translate from one language to another. They are also speeding the development of conversational systems — though this research is significantly more complex and will take longer to mature. It may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue. Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type “winne tonight drink resttaurant,” it might respond with: “i’m not a fan of wine.”  It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility. When Microsoft’s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue. In this case, the system knows enough about the world to identify Adele as a singer. Response Rank she's a singer 1 i don't know who adele is. 2 she is a singer 3 lana del rey 4 i don't know who she is but she is a singer 5 i don't know who she is but she's a singer 6 i don't know, i'm not a fan of adele 7 lana del ray 8 i don't know who she is, she's a singer 9 who is adele 10 i don't know who she is. she's a singer 11 i don't know who she is but she's a good singer 12 i don't know who she is. i'm not a fan of adele 13 i don't know who she is but she is a very good singer 14 i don't know who she is. she is a singer 15 i don't know her name. she's a singer 16 i don't know her name, she's a singer 17 she's not a singer 18 i don't know, i've never heard of her before 19 you don't know her 20 i don't know her name 21 i don't know, i've never heard of her 22 katy perry 23 i don't know who she is but i don't know her name 24 i don't really know who she is but i don't know her name 25 But researchers must also deal with the unexpected. Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude — or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit. Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error. This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix. But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems — general dialogue — is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come. For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. “There is a huge technical barrier here. We really don’t know how to build a personal assistant,” he said. “It may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.” In the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public. “We need people to forgive us when we screw up,” he said. “Pushing forward is going to involve some screw-ups.” Chat animations are based on data from Microsoft and draw from 50 possible responses for each interaction.

 It’s 2035, the Second American Civil War has been won by the other side, and you find yourself in a heap of trouble with Attorney General Logan Paul. (The future is very troubling.) He has dispatched an all-seeing eye-in-the-sky to tail you, an agile flying machine equipped with 13 cameras and a top speed of 25 miles per hour. The drone knows your face, your gait and your clothing. It hovers persistently behind your back, moving when you move, stopping when you stop, resisting every effort to shake it. You run into the woods, but you still can’t lose it. So now what? Clip this article and save it as a guide for surviving our airborne future. In a woodsy park in San Francisco last week, I had an encounter with just such a self-flying drone, and I found only one trick for escape. Hint: It involved the indignity of repeatedly running around a tree. As the hapless chump in its cross hairs, I will tell you this: Being tailed by a 13-eyed flying machine has a way of focusing the mind. The drone chasing me, the R1, was created by a start-up called Skydio; it sells for $2,499 and will begin shipping to customers in two to three weeks, the company says. It is the closest thing to a fully autonomous drone you can buy today. Autonomous drones have long been hyped, but until recently they’ve been little more than that. The technology in Skydio’s machine suggests a new turn. Drones that fly themselves — whether following people for outdoor self-photography, which is Skydio’s intended use, or for longer-range applications like delivery, monitoring and surveillance — are coming faster than you think. They’re likely to get much cheaper, smaller and more capable. They’re going to be everywhere, probably sooner than we can all adjust to them. Most consumer drones rely on some degree of automation in flight. DJI, the Chinese drone company that commands much of the market, makes several drones that can avoid obstacles and track subjects. But these features tend to be less than perfect, working best in mostly open areas. Just about every drone on the market requires a pilot. “Our view is that almost all of the use cases for drones would be better with autonomy,” said Adam Bry, Skydio’s chief executive. Skydio was founded by Mr. Bry and Abe Bachrach — who met as graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later started Google’s drone program, Project Wing — along with Matt Donahoe, an interface designer. In 2014, with funding from the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, the company began working on what would become the R1. Skydio has since raised $70 million from Andreessen and several other investors, including Institutional Venture Partners, Playground Global and the basketball player Kevin Durant. Skydio’s basic goal was a drone that requires no pilot. When you launch the R1 using a smartphone app, you have your subject stand in front of the drone, then tap that person on the screen — now it’s locked on. You can also select one of several “cinematic modes,” which specify the direction from which the drone will try to record its subject. (It can even predict your path and stay ahead of you to shoot a selfie from the front.) After takeoff, it’s hands off. The drone operates independently. In the eight-minute flight I saw — through a wooded trail sparsely populated with runners and dogs — the R1 followed its target with eerie determination, avoiding every obstacle as naturally as an experienced human pilot might, and never requiring help. It lost its subject — me — only once, but I had to really work to make that happen. Watch this clip, recorded by the R1’s main camera, showing the drone following Mr. Bry. When he runs, it immediately follows him, ducking behind trees, speeding up to catch him, then slowing when he slows. Much of the rest of the clip goes like that; every step he takes, the R1 is watching him. Time for some caveats: Skydio’s technology is far from perfect. It doesn’t work well in inclement weather or at night. It also requires a very high-powered processor, which gobbles up battery life; the R1 gets 16 minutes per flight, compared with around 20 for competing drones (but it will ship with two batteries, allowing for another flight after a quick swap out). Skydio’s drone is also entering a crowded marketplace that hasn’t been kind to new players. A parade of drone start-ups have gone belly up in the last couple of years, unable to compete with DJI’s technical innovation and manufacturing scale. Some of the most spectacular blowups, like that of the drone start-up Lily, involved overpromising and never delivering on autonomous features. Skydio’s founders say they’re keen to avoid that mistake. The company showed me the assembly line in its headquarters in Redwood City, Calif., where teams of technicians are finishing production-ready R1s by hand. The small-scale operation is meant to ensure quality, but it comes at a price. DJI’s latest feature-packed drone, the well-reviewed Mavic Air, sells for $800, a third of the price of the R1. “I know this technology is so much smarter, but I’m just not sure it’s enough to overtake the behemoth that is DJI,” said Sally French, a journalist who covers the drone industry at her site, The Drone Girl. She was also shown a preview of the R1 last week. Yet whatever happens to Skydio as a company, its flavor of autonomous tech seems likely to become ubiquitous. How Skydio has achieved autonomy is, at bottom, a marvel of software rather than hardware, and the software is likely to get cheaper and better quite quickly. There are two basic ways for computers to process the visual world. They can use cameras alone, or they can also use depth sensors, like lasers or radar, that precisely determine where objects are in space. Most self-driving car systems use expensive laser sensors, known as lidar, a spinning disk that sits on the car’s roof like a propeller beanie. Lidar was the key technology at issue in Waymo’s now-settled trade secrets lawsuit against Uber. The trial surfaced a note from Travis Kalanick, Uber’s former chief executive, that underscored lidar’s importance: “Laser is the sauce,” he wrote. But to Skydio, laser wasn’t the sauce. Lasers aren’t only expensive; they’re also heavy and bulky. (That’s why Elon Musk also isn’t a fan.) Cameras, meanwhile, are plentiful and cheap. Several years ago, Skydio took a gamble: It would use only cameras, arranged in eyelike pairs on every side of the drone, and hope that it could get laserlike accuracy using ever-improving artificial intelligence techniques. “A bird doesn’t need lidar to fly,” Mr. Bry told me. The scheme worked better than the team was expecting. Because an artificial intelligence technique known as deep learning has been improving much more quickly than insiders predicted, Skydio said, it is further along at key perceptual tasks than it had hoped to be, and Mr. Bry said the tech was still advancing. What this means is ubiquity. As I watched the R1 tail Mr. Bry, I played the scene forward in my mind: What happens when dozens or hundreds of runners and bikers and skiers and hikers and tourists begin setting out their own self-flying GoPros to record themselves? Our society has proved in thrall to photography; if you can throw up a camera and get a shot of you reaching the summit, who’s not going to do it? Even regulations may not be ready for the R1. Colin Snow, a drone industry analyst, pointed out to me that federal regulations require users to keep drones in their line of sight — and a drone that follows you is technically not in your line of sight. Mr. Bry disputed this characterization. He argued that regulations allow for momentary periods when the drone is not in the line of sight, as long as the vehicle does not interfere with manned aircraft. As for other social disruptions that autonomous drones might cause, Mr. Bry was guarded. “Obviously, we tell our users to be responsible,” he said. Which brings me to the escape plan. How do you lose an R1 that has been told to follow you? Here’s what worked for me: Find a tree. Run around it very precisely, just fast enough to stay exactly opposite the drone, so the tree trunk blocks its view of you for seconds at a time. Do it just right and the bird will lose you, stopping in its tracks, confused. But I don’t imagine this trick will work for long.

By Nellie Bowles FEB. 14, 2018 Political memes have gone mainstream as the distance between the White House and subcultures like 4Chan has closed. President Trump has frequently retweeted his fans’ meme work, #MeToo jumped from social media to every workplace, and political campaigns started to invest in the form more seriously. The political meme — text over an image, sometimes short videos or digital clip art meant to spread and be imitated — is often a guttural, simple message couched in humor, like the doctored video from September of Hillary Clinton being hit with his golf ball. The internet was born in text. Now, video and audio are ascendant, writing is being left behind, and everything will be different. By Farhad Manjoo FEB. 14, 2018 I’ll make this short: The thing you’re doing now, reading prose on a screen, is going out of fashion. We’re taking stock of the internet right now, with writers who cover the digital world cataloging some of the most consequential currents shaping it. If you probe those currents and look ahead to the coming year online, one truth becomes clear. The defining narrative of our online moment concerns the decline of text, and the exploding reach and power of audio and video. There are now more ways to tell if your tweet was bad. That’s because of the ratio. By Mike Isaac FEB. 14, 2018 It’s easy to tell when you’ve nailed a good tweet — just watch the likes and retweets pile up as the post goes viral. Now there are also more ways to tell if a tweet was bad. That’s because a new barometer for Twitter blahness has taken hold: the ratio. It’s harder to ignore harassment, or retaliate against accusers, when reports are bolstered by the stories of many others and the public is watching. By Claire Cain Miller FEB. 14, 2018 Susan Fowler had tried going to human resources. She had tried going to her managers. She had tried transferring departments. But nothing changed. The sexual and sexist comments she received as an engineer at Uber kept coming. So she went online and wrote a 3,000-word blog post exposing the behavior. The pioneers of social media have begun grumbling that their technology might be irresistible. But they have few ideas about how to tame the beast they built. By Farhad Manjoo FEB. 14, 2018 Your phone buzzes. A message, an Instagram post, a tweet — some bit of digital effluvia has come in, and it’s right there, promising a brief but necessary hit of connection. All you have to do is look. But, just as an experiment, how long can you resist looking? A minute? Two? If you make it that long, how do you start to feel? Can you concentrate? Does your mind wander at what you’re missing? And if you give in — as you surely will, as you probably do many times a day — how do you feel about yourself? Major companies have been forced to rethink how they advertise online after coming under fire when their digital ads appeared next to racist or fake-news content. By Sapna Maheshwari FEB. 14, 2018 For advertisers, one of the internet’s great promises has been the ability to automatically target people based on their interests and demographics, with little regard to the websites they are visiting. But these days, major brands have been forced to rethink how they advertise online. Companies from Kellogg to AT&T have come under fire for inadvertently funding bigotry, hate speech and misinformation, often because they were using automated ad technology to reach groups of people across a vast number of sites and videos. Instead of perfectly polishing their feeds, photographers and brands are now showing what women, in particular, actually look like. By Amanda Hess FEB. 14, 2018 For all the talk about the internet’s power to democratize the media, Instagram can present an awfully traditional picture of what a woman is supposed to be. The images that rise on the platform are a hellscape of white feminine conformity, with top influencers sporting the same matte lips and contoured cheeks, their bodies whittled and waxed and contorted into the same poses.

Federal and state authorities are investigating the sellers of artificial followers and other fraudulent social media engagement.
 Federal and state authorities are investigating the sellers of artificial followers and other fraudulent social media engagement. By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE, GABRIEL J.X. DANCE and RICH HARRIS JAN. 31, 2018 More than a million followers have disappeared from the accounts of dozens of prominent Twitter users in recent days as the company faces growing criticism over the proliferation of fake accounts and scrutiny from federal and state inquiries into the shadowy firms that sell fake followers. The people losing followers include an array of entertainers, entrepreneurs, athletes and media figures, many of whom bought Twitter followers or artificial engagement from a company called Devumi. Its business practices were detailed in a New York Times article on Saturday describing  a vast trade in fake followers and fraudulent engagement on Twitter and other social media sites, often using personal information taken from real users. Twitter said on Saturday that it would take action against Devumi’s practices. A Twitter spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment about whether the company was purging fake accounts. The singer Clay Aiken, the actor John Leguizamo and the reality TV star Lisa Rinna have each lost a substantial number of followers, according to a review of their accounts. So has Martha Lane Fox, a British businesswoman and Twitter board member. Other well-known users have taken to Twitter in recent days to complain of lost followers, suggesting that a broad swath of people may be affected, not just Devumi customers.    The company’s heightened campaign against bots comes as federal lawmakers and law enforcement officials in two states are scrutinizing Devumi and its competitors online, where numerous websites sell fake followers or engagement on Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and other social media platforms. On Tuesday, Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — the chairman and the ranking member, respectively, of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection and data security — asked the Federal Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the “deceptive and unfair marketing practices” of Devumi and similar companies. While Devumi promises customers “100 Percent Active, English Followers,” virtually all of the followers and retweets the company provides are fake, The Times found. Twitter prohibits buying followers of any kind. The Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, a Republican, has also begun an investigation into Devumi, joining Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general and a Democrat, who announced on Saturday that he would begin reviewing whether the company had violated state laws against impersonation and commercial deception. The Times found evidence that the information of Twitter users in every state — including thousands of people in Florida and New York — had been copied onto bots sold by Devumi or rival companies. At least 55,000 fake accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis. The original accounts list locations in all 50 U.S. states. By The New York Times   Devumi was based in Florida until recently but lists a New York City address on its website. The company’s owner, German Calas, also lives in Florida. “Based on the New York Times article, we have opened an investigation into these very serious allegations,” Ms. Bondi said in an interview Tuesday. “We would encourage any citizens who believe they have been a victim of this scam to please contact the Florida attorney general’s office immediately.” Mr. Calas did not respond to an email seeking comment. But on Monday, Devumi’s parent company, Bytion, filed paperwork in Florida indicating that it had moved its principal place of business to Colorado. Jared Stark, a lawyer for Mr. Calas’s business, said in an email that both companies had relocated to Denver earlier in January, a move he described as “in the works for some time.” He declined to comment on the investigations into Devumi. A reporter visiting Bytion’s Denver office on Tuesday found it largely empty, save for a few boxes against one wall and patio furniture on a balcony. Gerald Sexton, Bytion’s director of people and culture, declined to comment and said that Mr. Calas was not available. A few minutes later, a process server arrived at the office to deliver a subpoena from Mr. Schneiderman’s office. A spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman declined to comment. The disclosure of dozens of Devumi’s customers in entertainment, politics and business has sparked a renewed debate — often carried out on Twitter itself — about the prevalence of fraud and fakery on social media, where tens of millions of fake users still roam. The Chicago Sun-Times announced on Monday that it would suspend publishing reviews by the newspaper’s film critic, Richard Roeper, while conducting a review of his social media following. Mr. Roeper bought at least 25,000 followers from Devumi, according to records reviewed by The Times, and an analysis of his account indicates that many of his nearly quarter-million Twitter followers are fake accounts. Both Twitter and Facebook verify the identity of some celebrities, politicians and other high-profile users and include blue check marks on their account pages, in part to prevent scam artists from impersonating them. But a vast majority of accounts are not vetted in the same way. Moreover, Twitter does not require that accounts be associated with a real person. Mark Cuban, a prominent technology investor, tweeted on Monday that it was time for Twitter to change that policy, and for Facebook to tighten its requirements. Mr. Cuban elaborated over email, saying that automated accounts, or bots, and impersonation on Twitter had made him less enthusiastic about using the platform. “I don’t think your user handle or profile has to reflect your actual name or picture,” Mr. Cuban said. “I do think Twitter would benefit from requiring every account(s) being tied back to an individual. If someone wants to run a bot account, great, but identify a person behind it.” Some federal and state lawmakers have called for more stringent laws regulating social media companies, in part to combat the epidemic of fake accounts. Many fake accounts are deployed by Russia and other countries seeking to influence American politics, but others are used by marketing companies to influence consumers and even policymakers. Marc Levine, a California state assemblyman from outside San Francisco, introduced legislation on Monday that would require social media companies doing business in California to link every account to a human being. The legislation would also require that social media companies allow only human account holders to place advertisements on their platforms. “There are any number of interest groups looking to shape public opinion,” Mr. Levine said in an interview. “We’ve seen all of this exploited and millions of people manipulated.” Kassondra Cloos contributed reporting.

 Tens of millions of fake accounts infest the world's social media platforms. Is one of those fake accounts impersonating you? In a recent article, The New York Times detailed a global black market in stolen social identities. These stolen identities — names, pictures, hometowns, and other personal information ripped from real peoples' social media profiles — are the raw material for many ""bots,"" automated accounts bought and sold in bulk, sometimes by celebrities and entrepreneurs eager to bulk up their apparent influence on social media platforms. We'd like to know if you have ever come across your personal information being used on a fake account on Twitter, Facebook or any other platform. Our goal is to understand how well these social media companies police their own platforms for social identify theft and impersonation.

At the International Consumer Electronics Show this week in Las Vegas, thousands of tech companies showcased some of the hottest new innovations: artificial intelligence, self-driving car tech, the smart home, voice-controlled accessories, fifth-generation cellular connectivity and more.Curious about the new products and how they will affect your personal technology? Readers asked Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer who is attending the trade show, their questions about wireless, TV and the Internet of Things.
 Why does Apple, the most valuable company in the world, boycott CES? Apple doesn’t exhibit at trade shows in general. In 2008, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was pulling out of Macworld Expo, the Apple-centric trade show, where he had previously announced a number of important Apple products, including the original iPhone in 2007. Apple’s reasoning was that the company had retail stores all over the world that could showcase Apple products. In addition, the company had the clout and budget to host keynotes, or marketing events to unveil products, independent of a giant trade show, where companies are competing for attention from the press. Many companies, like Amazon, Samsung Electronics and Google, have followed suit and introduced products at their own events. Here’s what’s interesting: Over my last decade attending CES, Apple cast a long shadow over the conference despite not having an official presence. Many companies were making things that worked with the iPhone or iPad, like cases, speakers or apps. But this year, Apple doesn’t seem very relevant here. The show now revolves around Amazon and Google and their battle for domination with voice assistants. There are a good number of companies here showing smart home products that work with Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant and choosing to skip out on Apple’s HomeKit because of the stricter privacy requirements and extra fees associated with making products that are certified to work with HomeKit. So the show seems to have moved on from one giant to two others. I've been attending CES for 5 years and feel really underwhelmed by the products showcased at the event this year. I feel like we need to figure out how to ""make gadgets great again."" Analysts, entrepreneurs, and journalists I've talked to in Vegas this week shared similar impressions. Has CES gotten too big? Does it need to be more selective? What's going on? PG, that is definitely the sentiment among journalists and exhibitors I’ve chatted with this week. I think this year is an incremental phase in consumer technology.  A couple of years ago, virtual reality was the hot new tech at CES, with brand-new products like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets that worked very well. And Alexa was just starting to become popular, along with smart home accessories. This year, we’re seeing those technologies mature with improved features that make them more capable. That isn’t very exciting, but at the end of the day consumers will be getting better products in the coming year. What does it say about the state of tech companies and organizations that there are no female keynote speakers at CES, yet there are female robot strippers being showcased at the event? (CES added two female keynote panelists after backlash, but the point remains). Yes, the pole-dancing strippers were a real thing at a strip club this week. While they weren’t officially affiliated with CES, they were an effective gimmick to lure CES attendees into the strip club. Still, your point is valid: CES has a diversity problem. The vast majority of featured keynote speakers are men. In some ways, that mirrors the tech industry. The overwhelming majority of tech executives in Silicon Valley are white men. Tech companies have acknowledged their diversity issues, but over the years there has been little progress. How has the Spectre/Meltdown vulnerabilities been addressed at CES, if they have been? Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, gave a keynote speech at CES. Unsurprisingly, he downplayed the repercussions of Spectre and Meltdown, two security flaws that affect nearly all microprocessors in computers and smartphones, by saying the company has not heard any reports about people whose data was stolen as a result of Spectre or Meltdown. (How would anyone even know if they were victims in the first place?)  His statement was disappointing because downplaying the problem could make consumers complacent. Meltdown can be fixed with software updates for your operating system, browser and other important apps. But Spectre is an issue that can’t be completely fixed with a software patch; tech companies can only mitigate the vulnerability with software updates. The bottom line is you have to be diligent about keeping your software up-to-date. And you should also run an ad blocker to prevent malicious code from infecting you through ad networks when you’re browsing the web. What ""left-field"" finds did you stumble upon? I saw some pretty goofy gadgets, like a piece of rolling luggage with an electric scooter built into it. Can you imagine riding your luggage through the crowd at the airport? I also saw a robot sherpa — it was basically a big trunk for carrying heavy objects — that follows you around as you walk. It had sensors to avoid colliding with you. Brian, hi. I'm hoping that CES will bring announcements for in-wall light switch dimmers that don't require me to buy a separate hub. I don't need Alexa in my light switch, though I do want it to talk with her. Ideally, the same company would also have in-wall on/off switches and outlet controllers, so I don't need to have different apps to manage different switches. Thanks! Adam, I understand — a separate bridge or hub, which establishes a connection between your Wi-Fi router and a smart home device, is ugly and a waste of space. The good news for you is I did see some bridge-free light switch dimmers at CES. One example is Belkin’s Wemo dimmer switch, which only requires a Wi-Fi connection to work with Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant.  I think you will continue to see companies shift away from hubs toward Wi-Fi connections built into their appliances. The downside of this, in my experience, is that Wi-Fi-equipped smart home devices occasionally lose their connection with your Wi-Fi router, and you sometimes have to power cycle them (turn the power off and back on) to regain a connection. With a light dimmer, that might require flipping your circuit breaker, but hopefully not. What do you see as some of the big trends in the “smart kitchen” space? And who do you think is leading the charge as an appliance manufacturer? The smart kitchen, which is a segment of the smart home where devices are internet-connected, is very interesting to me because each big manufacturer is approaching it in a different way.  Samsung is selling a very expensive smart fridge that is equipped with a 21.5-inch touchscreen and voice controls; the company is focused on making the kitchen the center of the home, where families convene and spend quality time together. (I don’t know about your family, but that’s never been my experience.)  Whirlpool’s smart kitchen vision is to try to make it easier for you to figure out what to cook with the ingredients you have. The company is offering an app that lets you use your smartphone camera to scan the ingredients in your pantry or fridge so that the software can give you some ideas of what to cook.  It’s tough to say who is leading the charge because these are fairly new ideas, so we will have to see what resonates with consumers. Just curious to know about any new technology in locks. I run an Airbnb and I’m interested in battery technologies as most locks suck battery juice, especially the Wi-Fi models. Nick, I’m not a fan of smart locks. Every type has flaws. There are complete lock systems that include the dead bolt, door handle, keypad and electric locking system that talks to a smartphone. These are the most robust solutions, but they don’t fit on all doors. One lock I tried from Schlage didn’t work on two different doors; I probably would’ve had to cut new holes into the doors, which is a pain. Another approach to take instead is to try the robotic arm that attaches to your dead bolt and turns it. These are marketed as the simplest to install. The August lock is an example. But the reality is that when you install these devices, you need to make sure you have a modern high-quality deadbolt that can withstand being locked and unlocked repeatedly by a robot arm. In addition, you will need to change the batteries frequently, probably every other month. A third approach is a deadbolt with a wireless connection built into it that talks to your smartphone. The Kwikset Kevo, which is Wirecutter’s top pick for a smart lock, is an example. While this lock appears to be easy to install and well designed, there are hundreds of one-star Amazon reviews from customers who say the lock is unreliable, leaving them hanging outside the door. As a former Airbnb superhost, I recommend using an old-school lock box to provide keys to guests. A lock box requires no batteries, and it’s secure, easy to install, cheap and reliable. How are technology developers working to increase security with internet-connected devices? The tech giants that offer virtual assistants for controlling smart home devices — Apple, Google and Amazon — continually issue software updates with security updates. It’s those smaller brands making the smart home accessories that you need to be wary of. While many smart home products work great, their security teams probably are not as thorough or experienced as the people that work for large tech companies.  In the end, the onus is likely on you to protect yourself. I wrote a guide on how to fend off cyberattacks on your home devices. I also recommend reading privacy policies of smart home accessory makers to understand what data they are collecting about you and potentially sharing with third parties like marketers. How will new large smart appliances like refrigerators and washing machines begin to pop up in the average American home or apartment? I find there is still a large amount of 10-plus years old appliances (that function fine of course) that still occupy many living spaces. But with a revolution in technology that senses how much water to use when cleaning your clothes or when you should buy a new container of milk, how long would you predict it would take for the technology of today to become the standard? It will likely be a very long time. Many of these smart appliances have premium price tags. A smart refrigerator with Alexa controls, for example, costs upward of $4,000. It’s unclear why you would pay that much for a refrigerator when you can just put a cheap Echo Dot ($50) on your counter.  It’s also important to note that smart appliances have been around for many years. There are high-end ranges priced upward of $5,000 that include buttons you can press to tell the oven what you are cooking so it can set the temperature and time accordingly. At the end of the day, these features are a novelty: If you’re going to spend that much on a range, you’re probably a pretty good cook and know what temperature and timing to use to cook a roast or casserole.  Smart home appliances need to be cheaper and have more useful applications before they reach the mainstream. Until then, they are an impractical luxury. I just purchased a 4K, OLED HDR TV. Anything at CES suggest it will be obsolete anytime soon? Nope, you’re in good shape.  At CES, LG demonstrated a so-called 8K TV, which has quadruple the resolution of 4K TV. But rest assured that your 4K OLED HDR TV, which is the best type of television you can buy right now, won’t be obsolete for years. That’s because content makers are taking their sweet time to transition from 1080P resolution to 4K, meaning there isn’t much 4K video to watch right now, but there will be more coming over time. In addition, streaming devices like the Apple TV just recently added support for 4K. In other words, we’re only at the beginning of the adoption curve with these TVs, so sit back and enjoy your fancy television set. Given the push now to sell OLED TVs, what could they possibly do to improve picture quality, especially since content quality is not keeping up? I’m going to defer to Chris Heinonen, the TV expert at Wirecutter, a New York Times company that recommends products, for this one. He says the following:  “OLEDs can still improve quite a bit. For professional users, Sony makes a reference OLED that is an RGB OLED while consumer models are white OLEDs right now with color filters. The RGB version is over 50 percent brighter, and has more saturated, true colors for bright areas (fires, skies, leaves, and so on). Sony also just demoed a 10,000 nit LCD (a higher peak brightness than current OLED TVs) which is a long way off, but the extra brightness made everything look more like real life. 4K Blu-ray content, and streaming content, already has picture information that an OLED cannot correctly display. While they do look great, and are what I use as a reference, they still have a lot of room to improve, even with our current content.” Samsung has announced a 146-inch 8k TV called The Wall. Is there a market for this type of “consumer” product, how successful do you think this will be? And will other companies do the same? I wouldn’t expect this to be a consumer product. When picking screen size, you should consider the distance between where you are sitting and where the television is placed. In order to properly consume a 146-inch television, you would have to live in an enormous house with a huge amount of space in the living room. Many products shown at CES are merely demonstrations of what tech companies are capable of doing today; very few actually materialize into products you will buy on Amazon or at Best Buy. Are mobile phones trending towards more user friendly or less user friendly this year? Less friendly.  If you look at the sheer number of features that Apple and Google keep adding to iOS and Android year after year, mobile operating systems are becoming increasingly complex. (As an iOS user, I find the Mail app’s user interface to be confusing, and I find it perplexing that Apple hid the useful Airdrop feature in a menu that is difficult to find.) In addition, now that Apple has nixed the physical home button on the iPhone X, the way we use phones is poised to change significantly in the coming year. In both Android and iOS, we are increasingly relying on touch gestures that are not as intuitive to discover as pressing a physical button. Should I replace my recent vintage Apple Time Capsule router with an Eero or similar mesh network device? I think so. Internet service providers keep increasing their bandwidth speeds, and a dated router might not be able to deliver the higher speeds you could be getting. I like mesh networking, which is basically a system of Wi-Fi stations that work together to blanket every corner of your home with a strong wireless data connection. That is mainly beneficial for larger homes with multiple stories, but even if you have a modestly sized home you could benefit from having two mesh stations creating a continuous wireless link throughout your home.  The other benefit of modern mesh networking systems is that they automatically apply software updates with the latest security enhancements. Many older routers require the consumer to manually download the updates, and I don’t know anyone who would even remember to do that.   Advertisement",15739

 Several months ago, a team of men ascended the Greater Caucasus Mountains in Georgia. They led horses loaded with electrical wire, solar panels, batteries, toolboxes and drills powerful enough to grind through rock. With jagged ridgelines above and shadowed valleys below, the men were on a quest to bring the internet to one of the world’s most remote places: Tusheti, a rural province on the Russian border. Tusheti’s clean air, crisp blue skies and mountain-studded landscape already attract some tourists, but government officials think there is potential for many more. Access to the internet will make it easier for travelers to book reservations online, but it will also stir e-commerce and local business development, and give a lift to health care and education services in the area. For now, though, Tusheti has little electricity, and maybe more sheep than people. For centuries, Tusheti’s rugged terrain has encouraged a nomadic lifestyle that continues to this day. Shepherds roam the mountainsides with their flocks in the summer, and then move down to more temperate pastures for the rest of the year. Many people who aren’t shepherds do the same. For much of the year, they live in lowland communities near Tusheti that have schools, hospitals and, yes, internet service. Come summer, they return to the rocky slopes. Tusheti spans about 370 square miles – an area a bit larger than Berlin – but only about 50 people stay through the winter. Temperatures can drop to near zero Fahrenheit, and snow covers the main roads for up to six months. In Shenako, one of several dozen villages in the region, only one couple stays through the winter. As the weeks pass, other people arrive by helicopter, hitching a ride on the Georgian Border Police’s monthly trips to change crews at border outposts. For the workers on the internet mission, time could feel short. Dusk was coming on fast when the crew reached Bochorna, a tiny hamlet whose 7,700-foot elevation makes it the highest continuously inhabited village in Europe, according to the Georgian government. The workers’ chief focus: establishing an internet connection for the lone year-round resident, Irakli Khvedaguridze, a 76-year-old doctor. When winter arrives, the government pays Dr. Khvedaguridze to buy medical supplies; if he runs out of anything, a border police helicopter delivers what he needs. He spends the winter treating the sick in nearby communities, reading medical journals and listening to the radio. When he needs company, he goes into Omalo, one of Tusheti’s larger villages, on his homemade skis. Although he had no computer or smartphone, he was curious about how it all worked.  His first thought: people without cell coverage would now be able to call him in the winter if they were sick or injured. “It will be easier to get in touch now,” he said. Financed largely through a $40,000 grant from the Internet Society, a global nonprofit, the workers came from local organizations: the Tusheti Development Fund, the Small and Medium Telecommunications Operators’ Association and Freenet, a local internet service provider. They offered materials or services for free, or at little cost. They all felt a connection of some kind to the Tusheti mountains. “I am originally from the mountains,” said Ucha Seturi, a lawyer and engineer who is coordinating the project.  “The mountain people are a little bit separate from the rest of society. They are not developing. So for me it’s really important to create real points of connection with the rest of society so they can develop.” Many people in nearby communities are quite familiar with the allure of the internet. Temuri Babulaidze, whose father helped start the Tusheti Development Fund, enjoys playing online video games at the family’s home in Kvemo Alvani, a town where many Tushetians live in the winter. In addition to the residents of 26 villages in Tusheti who will now be able to log on to the internet, dozens of hostels and small hotels will benefit from the service. “Tourism is a beacon of hope for us,” said Ia Buchaidze, who owns a local bakery, “and the internet is very important for that.” Not everyone is happy with the change. “It's not good,” said Yochanan Herman, an Israeli traveler who was hiking the mountains, “because there are not many places in the world without Internet.” The long days in the mountains can be hazardous for the entire crew, including the horses. The men watched helplessly one day as a packhorse stumbled and plunged off the trail, rolling down like a barrel and scattering its load as it tumbled. The horse eventually righted itself, but it was bleeding beneath its saddle blanket. It would be O.K., the workers learned. They combed the hillside for its load. Two toolboxes were smashed; among the other casualties was a power inverter. That was a major problem: Without it, the heavy drill wouldn’t work. The masts holding internet antennas were not the only towers visible on the mountainsides. There were also skeletal memorials to the Communist era: pylons that carried electricity across the border from the Soviet Union into Tusheti and the rest of Georgia. The towers remain, but the power lines are gone, pulled down after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. There were other reminders of that era: villages abandoned after, some residents say, the Soviets forced people off the mountains. The internet network is helping stir a turnaround for Tusheti. In the past year, a new, 100-bed hotel was proposed for Omalo. There is talk of a major ski resort and a new roadway. The internet will undoubtedly bring the world closer to Tusheti. The question is whether its rustic otherworldliness will disappear.

An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a boy who enjoys playing online video games in his home in the town of Kvemo Alvani. He is Temuri Babulaidze, not Termui.  Advertisement",6107

 The woman in the photo seems familiar. She looks like Jennifer Aniston, the “Friends” actress, or Selena Gomez, the child star turned pop singer. But not exactly. She appears to be a celebrity, one of the beautiful people photographed outside a movie premiere or an awards show. And yet, you cannot quite place her. That’s because she’s not real. She was created by a machine. The image is one of the faux celebrity photos generated by software under development at Nvidia, the big-name computer chip maker that is investing heavily in research involving artificial intelligence. At a lab in Finland, a small team of Nvidia researchers recently built a system that can analyze thousands of (real) celebrity snapshots, recognize common patterns, and create new images that look much the same — but are still a little different. The system can also generate realistic images of horses, buses, bicycles, plants and many other common objects. The project is part of a vast and varied effort to build technology that can automatically generate convincing images — or alter existing images in equally convincing ways. The hope is that this technology can significantly accelerate and improve the creation of computer interfaces, games, movies and other media, eventually allowing software to create realistic imagery in moments rather than the hours — if not days — it can now take human developers. In recent years, thanks to a breed of algorithm that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, companies like Google and Facebook have built systems that can recognize faces and common objects with an accuracy that rivals the human eye. Now, these and other companies, alongside many of the world’s top academic A.I. labs, are using similar methods to both recognize and create. Nvidia's images can't match the resolution of images produced by a top-of-the-line camera, but when viewed on even the largest smartphones, they are sharp, detailed, and, in many cases, remarkably convincing. For example, look at the two photos below and see if you can figure out which person is real. 

          This one is computer-generated
 

          This one is also computer-generated
 ● Sorry! This was a trick question. Both images were generated by computers. Like other prominent A.I. researchers, the Nvidia team believes the techniques that drive this project will continue to improve in the months and years to come, generating significantly larger and more complex images. “We think we can push this further, generating not just photos but 3-D images that can be used in computer games and films,” said Jaakko Lehtinen, one of the researchers behind the project. Today, many systems generate images and sounds using a complex algorithm called a neural network. This is a way of identifying patterns in large amounts of data. By identifying common patterns in thousands of car photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to identify a car. But it can also work in the other direction: It can use those patterns to generate its own car photos. As it built a system that generates new celebrity faces, the Nvidia team went a step further in an effort to make them far more believable. It set up two neural networks — one that generated the images and another that tried to determine whether those images were real or fake. These are called generative adversarial networks, or GANs. In essence, one system does its best to fool the other — and the other does its best not to be fooled. “The computer learns to generate these images by playing a cat-and-mouse game against itself,” said Mr. Lehtinen. 10 MINUTES 8 HOURS 16 HOURS 1 DAY 2 DAYS 3 DAYS 4 DAYS 5 DAYS 6 DAYS 7 DAYS 8 DAYS 9 DAYS 10 DAYS 14 DAYS 16 DAYS 18 DAYS This series of images shows the output of Nvidia’s system over the course of 18 days of processing. With their method, called progressive GANs, the Nvidia researchers built a system that begins with low-resolution images and then gradually progresses to higher resolutions. This allows the training to happen more quickly, but it also in a more controlled and stable way. The result: 1024- by 1024-pixel images that are sharp, detailed, and, in many cases, very convincing. Source: Nvidia A second team of Nvidia researchers recently built a system that can automatically alter a street photo taken on a summer’s day so that it looks like a snowy winter scene. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have designed another that learns to convert horses into zebras and Monets into Van Goghs. DeepMind, a London-based A.I. lab owned by Google, is exploring technology that can generate its own videos. And Adobe is fashioning similar machine learning techniques with an eye toward pushing them into products like Photoshop, its popular image design tool. Trained designers and engineers have long used technology like Photoshop and other programs to build realistic images from scratch. This is what movie effects houses do. But it is becoming easier for machines to learn how to generate these images on their own, said Durk Kingma, a researcher at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab founded by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and others, who specializes in this kind of machine learning. “We now have a model that can generate faces that are more diverse and in some ways more realistic than what we could program by hand,” he said, referring to Nvidia’s work in Finland. But new concerns come with the power to create this kind of imagery. With so much attention on fake media these days, we could soon face an even wider range of fabricated images than we do today. “The concern is that these techniques will rise to the point where it becomes very difficult to discern truth from falsity,” said Tim Hwang, who previously oversaw A.I. policy at Google and is now director of the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, an effort to fund ethical A.I. research. “You might believe that accelerates problems we already have.” Each of these images took about 18 days for the computers to generate, before reaching a point that the system found them believable. Source: Nvidia The idea of generative adversarial networks was originally developed in 2014 by a researcher named Ian Goodfellow, while he was a Ph.D. student at the University of Montreal. He dreamed up the idea after an argument at a local bar, and built the first prototype that same night. Now Mr. Goodfellow is a researcher at Google, and his idea is among the most important and widely explored concepts in the rapidly accelerating world of artificial intelligence. Though this kind of photo generation is currently limited to still images, many researchers believe it could expand to videos, games and virtual reality. But Mr. Kingma said this could take years, just because it will require much larger amounts of computing power. That is the primary problem that Nvidia is also working on, along with other chip makers. Researchers are also using a wide range of other machine learning techniques to edit video in more convincing — and sometimes provocative — ways. In August, a group at the University of Washington made headlines when they built a system that could put new words into the mouth of a Barack Obama video. Others, including Pinscreen, a California start-up, and iFlyTek of China, are developing similar techniques using images of President Donald Trump. The results are not completely convincing. But the rapid progress of GANs and other techniques point to a future where it becomes easier for anyone to generate faux images or doctor the real thing. That is cause for real concern among experts like Mr. Hwang. Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, an organization that analyzes current events using publicly available images and video, pointed out that fake images are by no means a new problem. In the years since the rise of Photoshop, the onus has been on citizens to approach what they view online with skepticism. But many of us still put a certain amount of trust in photos and videos that we don’t necessarily put in text or word of mouth. Mr. Hwang believes the technology will evolve into a kind of A.I. arms race pitting those trying to deceive against those trying to identify the deception. Mr. Lehtinen downplays the effect his research will have on the spread of misinformation online. But he does say that, as a time goes on, we may have to rethink the very nature of imagery. “We are approaching some fundamental questions,” he said. Advertisement",8590

 Have you ever seen a post on Facebook that you were surprised wasn’t removed as hate speech? Have you flagged a message as offensive or abusive but the social media site deemed it perfectly legitimate? Users on social media sites often express confusion about why offensive posts are not deleted. Paige Lavender, an editor at HuffPost, recently described her experience learning that a vulgar and threatening message she received on Facebook did not violate the platform’s standards. Here are a selection of statements that combine examples from a Facebook training document with real-world comments found on social media. Most readers will find them offensive. But can you tell which ones would run afoul of Facebook’s rules on hate speech? Hate speech is one of several types of content that Facebook reviews, in addition to threats and harassment. Facebook defines hate speech as: Facebook’s hate speech guidelines were published in June by ProPublica, an investigative news organization, which is gathering users’ experiences about how the social network handles hate speech. Danielle Citron, an information privacy expert and professor of law at the University of Maryland, helped The New York Times analyze six deeply insulting statements and determine whether they would be considered hate speech under Facebook’s rules. Would this statement meet Facebook’s criteria for hate speech? Yes No Would you consider the previous statement hate speech? 0% Yes 0% No Would this statement meet Facebook’s criteria for hate speech? Yes No Would you consider the previous statement hate speech? 0% Yes 0% No Would this statement meet Facebook’s criteria for hate speech? Yes No Would you consider the previous statement hate speech? 0% Yes 0% No Would this statement meet Facebook’s criteria for hate speech? Yes No Would you consider the previous statement hate speech? 0% Yes 0% No Would this statement meet Facebook’s criteria for hate speech? Yes No Would you consider the previous statement hate speech? 0% Yes 0% No Would this statement meet Facebook’s criteria for hate speech? Yes No Would you consider the previous statement hate speech? 0% Yes 0% No Did any of these answers surprise you? You’re probably not alone. Ms. Citron said that even thoughtful and robust definitions of hate speech can yield counterintuitive results when enforced without cultural and historic context. “When you’re trying to get as rulish as possible, you can lose the point of it,” she said. “The spirit behind those rules can get lost.” A Facebook spokeswoman said that the company expects its thousands of content reviewers to take context into account when making decisions, and that it constantly evolves its policies to keep up with changing cultural nuances.  In response to questions for this piece, Facebook said it had changed its policy to include age as a protected category. While Facebook’s original training document states that content targeting “black children” would not violate its hate speech policy, the company’s spokeswoman said that such attacks would no longer be acceptable.

The first iPhone was released 10 years ago and swiftly turned the smartphone from a curiosity into our constant companion. It was not the first smartphone, but it has been responsible for cementing an always-connected way of life.
Related Article
 It wasn’t the first smartphone, the first mobile computer, or the first anything, really. But when I got my hands on the first iPhone in 2007, I knew it was unlike any machine I’d ever used before, and it would forever alter my tech-addled life. It turns out it probably altered yours, too. In the early days, it was the simple things that were magical. The internet in your pocket. Connectivity at all times — news, baseball scores, recipes. (How innocent we were.) These sound like little things. But the collective weight of these tiny conveniences added up to something I almost couldn’t live without. Almost. I returned the first iPhone three weeks after buying it. Its camera wasn’t great. It didn’t have the App Store. It worked on just one carrier. It cost $599. It was slow — very, very slow. Still, in those long moments it took to load a web page, you could see the whole future laid out before you: If they could get this right, if they could turn this into a general-purpose everywhere computer, it could change everything. The speed of the internet was vastly improved in the second one. The connected-everywhere promise was becoming something of a reality. And, despite Steve Jobs’ early objections, Apple created its App Store. Suddenly, the iPhone wasn’t just a shiny bauble. It was useful. It could mimic just about any other gadget you had, from your Game Boy to your flashlight. And apps could do things no other gadgets could do. Before the App Store, a song could come on the radio and you’d have no way of figuring out what it was. Now you Shazam’d it. Today, a lot of what you use on the iPhone is made by other people. These phones also knew where you were in the world, thanks to GPS. You could use maps in real time to get around. But GPS would eventually lead to so much more: Uber, Tinder, a scrapbook of photos on a map. The price was also right. AT&T;, the only carrier offering it at the time, sold the new phone with a subsidy. $199. Almost too good to pass up if you could afford it. It created a dynamic that would turn the iPhone into the world’s most profitable product — a luxury device at a mainstream price. People had been snapping self-portraits with cheap cellphones for years. But the pictures didn’t look great. Self-snapping was seen as tacky, uncouth, a thing for MySpace. The iPhone 4 changed that. The first iPhone with a camera on its front, it let you take good-looking pictures of yourself. The phenomenon became agonizing to parents, and irresistible to everyone else. Snapchat was released a year later, in 2011. So was iCloud, Apple’s backup storage service. The collection of these technologies — selfie cameras, photo chatting, hackable online backups — would rock people’s lives. Dozens of celebrities’ intimate iCloud photos were hacked in 2014. “Revenge porn” became a thing. And remember Anthony Weiner? She didn’t sound like Rosie from “The Jetsons.” She was personable, and even tried to make jokes. She was Siri, the first robotic assistant that most of us encountered. But she quickly disappointed. She didn’t seem very smart. She wasn’t very useful. She was slow and unreliable. She misheard you. In time, she was eclipsed. Now there’s Alexa and Google Now. Siri has felt stuck in the past. The iPhone 5 carried a bigger screen stuffed into a brushed aluminum enclosure. There was often no purer joy than simply holding it in your hand. Design-wise, the iPhone has gone downhill ever since. But the iPhone 5 wasn’t just about design. It’s when the iPhone grew up. The cameras were simply dazzling, so good you didn’t need to carry anything else. The iPhone had consumed another gadget, the point-and-shoot. (This was around the time that Kodak declared bankruptcy.) And the iPhone got fast. Really fast. Carriers began handling more and more data. Everyone underestimated how all this would change the world. Then we started to see it: Our social media feeds, which have become the main way we encountered news, filled up with photos, videos and live broadcasts snapped on phones. The whole world came to you through a window in your hands. It was unsettling and unavoidable. It was distracting, too. The iPhone — and its numerous competitors — were so irresistible that people would risk death to text. There were theories that they sapped our attention, that they were creating a new generation of antisocial and unstable young people. (Some of these worries were overblown, as they always are with new technologies.) By the end of 2013, Apple had sold nearly 500 million iPhones. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said at the time that people were sending two billion messages a day on iPhones and other devices running its mobile operating system. A few years earlier, Samsung created a laughably huge phone, the Galaxy Note. It turned out to be a huge seller. Apple’s dominance now appeared to be threatened. People started to say it couldn’t innovate. So Apple did something radical, and obvious: It made bigger phones. They sold sold amazingly well, and Apple’s stock shot up. But its decision to copy its rivals on size felt like a new turn in its history. It marked a stepping back from the vanguard. Apple’s phones are still the best you can buy. They still pack some of the most innovative features on the market. But they’re not all that much better. Which phone you buy now feels like a matter of personal taste, rather than a judgment on product quality alone. For the iPhone to continue to be the iPhone, the trend-setting device of a generation, Apple has to do something big. This week, Apple tried to do just that: It unveiled what it calls “the future of the smartphone,” the iPhone X (pronounced “ten,” because, well, it’s Apple). It does away with the Home button, it unlocks with facial recognition and it can animate your facial gestures onto piles of poo. But is it the next big thing? Check back in a decade.

UPDATED September 13, 2017
 
At Apple’s special event commemorating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, the company announced upgrades for the iPhone, including a premium model that starts at $999, and the Apple Watch, which will include cellular connectivity in some models. Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, has responded to some of the most notable questions about the new devices submitted by hundreds of readers.
 I have an iPhone 5S and though it is small...what do I gain from the new iPhone coming out tomorrow? What is the $1K about? I am maybe an overage user of iPhone functions but feel I need a university degree in iPhone to keep up. Gail, the upshot of the $999 iPhone is that you will have more buying options than you did before. In the past, when Apple announced new iPhones, your options were to get the iPhone with the standard-size screen or the one with the bigger screen. With the addition of the $999 iPhone, known as iPhone X, your options will now be to get the normal-size iPhone, the big-screen iPhone, or the iPhone X with some fancy features that you won’t get on the cheaper models. What will you gain? That depends on your preferences. If you are a gadget enthusiast who needs the latest and greatest cutting-edge technology, the premium iPhone would benefit you. But if you’re just in the market for a phone that is superior to your iPhone 5S in terms of speed, camera performance and so on, you will be happy with a normal iPhone. Will there be a replacement for the SE? Will it be more like the iPhone 7 or the new phones? Will it be available at the same time as the larger phones? Lee, I have heard there will not be an update for the iPhone SE, the model with the 4-inch screen. That doesn’t mean the product is dead — it could be refreshed at a future event. Or Apple could always release a new one and announce it on the Apple Store website. How much longer can Apple sustain creating increasingly expensive iPhones? At some point they will become inaccessible to the average consumer. Hi Evelyn -- while Apple is adding a premium tier to its iPhone family, the iPhone overall isn't getting much more expensive. The base model of the iPhone costs $699, up from the $649 starting price of past iPhones. The big question will be: How good are the normal iPhones compared with the premium one? Will they be so unappealing in comparison that it would be foolish not to get the premium iPhone? I imagine that Apple would want the vast majority of customers to continue buying the $699 iPhone, while the tech enthusiasts gravitate toward the premium one. But we will have to see. Once Apple releases this iPhone do you think they will present it as an iPhone edition type product as they did with the Apple Watch and discontinue it after its year of sale do to its price point or do you believe that they will continue this trend of releasing high end products for the niche market. Malhar, it’s a sharp observation that Apple tested this strategy with the Apple Watch. When it released the Apple Watch, the premium gold Apple Watch Edition cost upward of $10,000. Apple quietly discontinued that model about a year later. However, last year it introduced a ceramic version of Apple Watch Edition that costs about $1,300. I presume that Apple used the watch pricing to conclude that a good number of people would buy a $999 iPhone. Will the new Apple Watch let one listen to an audio book without needing the iPhone nearby? In theory, yes. Apple did not demonstrate an audiobook playing on an Apple Watch at the event, but the point of the Apple Watch gaining cellular capability is that it can work independently from the iPhone. Assuming an audiobook provider like Audible offers an Apple Watch app, you should be able to stream audiobooks with just a cellular Apple Watch. Without a home button how will Touch ID work for banking and other apps? On the $999 iPhone X, Touch ID has been replaced with Face ID, a feature that uses an infrared camera system to scan your face. That will unlock the phone and also log into sensitive software like banking apps. On the cheaper iPhone 8, which starts at $699, Touch ID remains. Any indication whether a data plan for Apple Watch 3 will be necessary to take advantage of cellular connectivity features? The Apple Watch will share the same phone number as your iPhone. However, carriers will have different pricing structures, so you will have to look up your carrier on Apple’s webpage to see your options. On AT&T;, for example, a feature called NumberSync will fold your watch’s cellular plan into your iPhone’s. Adding the watch to your account will incur an additional charge of $10 a month to share your phone plan’s data, voice and texts on the watch. Does the facial recognition work in the dark? According to Apple, facial recognition on the iPhone X will be able to scan your face in the dark. It works by spraying infrared dots all over your face to get a good scan. It remains to be seen how well this does in bright sunlight, like at a beach. Experts say infrared gets blown out by bright light. Are all the features of the 8 Plus that you write about also available in the iPhone X? There are many differences between the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X. The iPhone 8 Plus has an LCD screen, and the iPhone X has an OLED display that takes up nearly the entire face of the device by eliminating the borders around the screen. Both the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X have glass bodies, the ability to be charged wirelessly and a dual-lens, depth-sensing camera system. But the main difference is that the iPhone 8 Plus has a home button and a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the device. The iPhone X eliminates the home button and fingerprint sensor and scans your face to unlock the device. Will there be an iPhone X Plus ? There is only one screen size for the iPhone X: 5.8 diagonal inches, which is bigger than the 5.5-inch screen on the iPhone 8 Plus. Does iPhone X have cordless charging? The iPhone X and iPhone 8 phones support magnetic induction, a method of charging also found on the Apple Watch. You can basically place the phone on a pad and it will charge without plugging a cable into the device. However, it is misleading of Apple to call this “wireless” charging, because a wire still needs to be plugged into the inductive charging medium, such as a charging pad or mat. Will there be more data, photo space in the new phones? The base model of the iPhone 8, which costs $699, includes 64 gigabytes of storage, which is double the 32 gigabytes of storage included on the base model of the iPhone 7. However, the maximum capacity for the new iPhones remains at 256 gigabytes. Screen and facial recognition aside, it looks like the hardware between the X and 8 are similar. Any reason someone who is unimpressed by the facial recognition would still upgrade to the X over the 8? I suspect the vast majority of iPhone customers will be happy with the iPhone 8, whereas technology enthusiasts with disposable income will prefer the iPhone X. The main differentiator, aside from the facial recognition features, will probably be the screen technology: The OLED display technology on the iPhone X has better color accuracy and higher contrast ratio while being thinner and lighter than the LCD on the iPhone 8. I was wondering if the iPhone 8 and iPhone X will support the traditional lightning cable wired charging? Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you! Yes, all the new iPhones still include a Lightning connector in addition to supporting inductive charging through their glass bodies. Is the iPhone X unbreakable? I'd hate to pay $1,000, drop it, have have to replace it. A few years ago I heard about unbreakable sapphire technology, but not so much anymore. Apple did not claim that the iPhone X is unbreakable. It is very unlikely that the device, which has a glass body, would be unbreakable. I always recommend putting a protective case on a smartphone. Face ID —  if you need someone to open your phone will they be able to?   Apple did not demonstrate the ability to add an extra face, like a spouse’s, to your iPhone. However, you could still share your passcode to let someone else unlock your phone. IPhone 8 looks like an incremental change to the 7, still lagging on Samsung quality screens and edge-to-edge display -- why isn't Apple leapfrogging the competition with “wow” innovation? Your insight, please. Indeed, the new Samsung phones, the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy Note 8, have edge-to-edge displays using OLED technology. By contrast, Apple’s iPhone 8 and 8 Plus still have bezels, or borders, and use LCD technology; only the iPhone X has the edge-to-edge OLED screen. It may come down to supply constraints. Analysts say Samsung manufactures the vast majority (more than 90 percent) of OLED displays. There is also bad blood between the two companies: They have fought each other over copyright infringement. So catching up with Samsung’s screen technology is proving difficult for Apple. Does it make sense to buy a phone through your wireless service provider or should I go straight to the Apple store? And does it make sense to pre-order? Do we know when phones will be in stores? In my experience, it makes little difference to buy your phone from your carrier or from Apple directly. The only notable difference is that Apple offers its own protection plan for the iPhone and a less-confusing option to buy the phone unlocked outright at full price. If I’m buying online, I prefer to order iPhones directly from Apple, but if I’m lining up at a retail store on Day 1, I prefer buying from a carrier because the lines tend to be shorter than the typical line at the Apple Store. Will any of the new models have a headphone jack? Say R.I.P. to the headphone jack, at least on Apple products. None of the new iPhones have headphone jacks, and I don’t think Apple will turn back on its commitment to wireless audio accessories. When I bought my iPhone 6 The New York Times advised on the most economical way to purchase a new phone. What is your advice now? No matter how you pay for an iPhone — buying it outright for full price or choosing an installment plan in which you spread out the cost in monthly payments — you will end up paying the full price of it. There are no interest fees incurred for paying through an installment plan, so that is a fine option if you don’t have $700 to $1,000 to burn on a new iPhone right away. If you like to upgrade every year, there are annual upgrade installment plans that let you trade in your phone for a new phone each year. The issue with that is you are essentially leasing the phone like you would a car; you get on a constant treadmill of buying phones. As for me, I’m an advocate of buying your smartphone outright and holding onto it for as long as you can. Is the battery better? Apple says the iPhone X has two more hours of battery life than the iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 has the same battery life as the iPhone 7, and the iPhone 8 Plus has the same battery life as the iPhone 7 Plus. I would take these estimates with a grain of salt: Because the phones are faster, you will probably use them more, and battery life may feel shorter as a result. Entering passwords to open various apps and sites is one of the real burdens of technology. Is facial recognition a potential replacement for passwords? A few of my apps and sites are opened by fingerprint recognition but these are few in number. Yes. Password management apps like LastPass and 1Password, which use one master password to access a vault of all your passwords, will be able to use Face ID to enter the master password. Any app that uses Touch ID, Apple’s fingerprint recognition software, to log in with a password will be able to support Face ID. What angle does iPhone X have to be at to unlock it? I check my phone often as it lies on my desk. Does Face ID mean having to actually pick up your phone each time you want to unlock it? If so that would be a huge step backward! Apple hasn’t yet clarified what the angle limitations are for Face ID. However, it did say that Face ID would work when the phone is flat on a desk. How much better is the camera? I am starting a photo project that will be shown on my web page. I am looking for best resolution possible, and maximum richness in presentation from taking to adjusting then showing again. I will reserve judgment of the cameras until after I have reviewed the new iPhones. However, I will point out that the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X have a new feature called Portrait Lighting. It uses a dual-lens camera system and an image-signal processor to analyze a scene and blur out the background and focus on the subject, a DSLR-like effect. The iPhone 7 Plus had Portrait mode, which was the same effect, but Portrait Lighting is supposed to do a better job at separating subjects from the background because the software maps out your face. As for the resolution, the new iPhones have 12-megapixel sensors, the same as the last iPhones. Does the iPhone facial recognition work while you are wearing glasses? Or do you have to take them off for the phone to recognize you?  Apple says Face ID will work even if you are wearing glasses or a hat. The system learns more about your face over time. Face ID should also work in the dark and be able to scan your face when the phone is laid down flat on a table. When are the new phones available? If I am eligible for an upgrade do I have to pay full price? The iPhone X arrives in stores Nov. 3. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus arrive Sept. 22. If you are eligible for an upgrade on a contract, you should be able to pay a subsidized price. However, many carriers will probably offer some discounts if you switch from your network. You should also be able to save some money if you trade in your old smartphone. What's the difference between iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S8? Other than facial recognition and the screen, I don't see much difference, especially for the price.   Indeed, both the Galaxy S8 and iPhone X have a 5.8-inch edge-to-edge display. The main difference will be what’s inside. Apple’s A11 chip is expected to be significantly faster than the Samsung Galaxy S8’s processor. Other than that, the obvious difference is that the iPhone is tied to Apple’s ecosystem of apps and services, whereas the Samsung phone relies on Google’s Android platform. When watching movies and video on the iPhone X in full screen, will the video play under and around the camera notch or will the video be reduced and played just on the border of the camera notch? The video will play under and around the camera notch. The notch is a bit of an eyesore, but Apple demonstrated apps and photos filling up the entire screen. Hi Brian! I'm retired and hanging on to a 5S, although I'm ready for an upgrade. My clumsy fingers are struggling to hit keys for texting. I'm interested in the iPhone 8, is there a $100 benefit to the 8 Plus for casual texts? I slip the 5S in my front pocket, but it sounds like I might need to switch to a rear location like all the skinny teens. Thanks in advance. Frank, I think the larger screen on the iPhone 8 should help you type more easily — the bigger keys will probably be easier for you to see and press. For what it’s worth, I use the iPhone 7, which is about the same size as the iPhone 8, and have no trouble fitting it in my front pocket. (And yes, I wear skinny jeans!) Will wireless charging work through a phone case: Does it matter what the case material is? Yes, you will be able to charge via induction through many phone cases. But thickness may be a factor. Belkin, for example, says that with its induction charging pad for iPhone 8, cases up to 3 millimeters thick will work. The good news is that if you owned an iPhone 7, the same cases will fit snugly on the iPhone 8. The Wirecutter, a product recommendations site owned by The New York Times, has a nice guide on the best iPhone cases. Advertisement",16060

There are more reasons than ever to understand how to protect your personal information, as major website breaches become ever more frequent. On Tuesday, Yahoo said that all three billion of its users had been affected by a breach in 2013, up from the one billion it had originally estimated.
 Unfortunately, you may want to assume that it was. Cyberattacks happen all the time. Regardless of the type of breach or the company involved, it’s always a safe bet to change passwords for sites that contain sensitive information like financial, health or credit card data. Do not use the same password across multiple sites and do not use your Social Security number as a username or password, especially in the wake of the recent Equifax breach. And if you were not doing so already, you will have to treat everything you receive online with an abundance of suspicion, in case hackers are trying to trick you out of even more information. Try a password manager like 1Password or LastPass. These sites create a unique password for each website you visit and store them in a database protected by a master password that you create. Password managers reduce the risk of reused passwords or those that are easy to decode. Wirecutter, a The New York Times company, provides a helpful explanation of why password managers are so essential. They also maintain an updated guide to what it considers to be the best password managers. If you must create your own passwords, try creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases or one-sentence summaries of strange life events and add numbers and special characters.  My favorite number is Green4782#  The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224% Or, if you’re extra paranoid, consider mimicking this setup. Take the sentence:  One time in class I ate some glue And convert it into this:  1TiC!AsG  One time in class I ate some glue → 1TiC!AsG In general, create the strongest passwords for the sites that contain the most sensitive information and do not reuse them anywhere. Passwords are not enough. If a site offers additional security features, like secondary or two-factor authentication, enable them. Then, when you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text) with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in. (Here’s a link to turn on two-factor authentication for Gmail accounts. Here’s one for Yahoo accounts, and here’s one for Outlook accounts.) Many bank sites and major sites like Google and Apple offer two-factor authentication. In some cases, the second authentication is required only if you are logging in from a new computer. Sites will often use common security questions to recover a user’s account if the password is forgotten. These questions are problematic because the internet has made public record searches simple and the answers are usually easy to guess. In a study, security researchers at Google found that with a single guess, an attacker would have a 19.7 percent chance of duplicating an English-speaking user’s answer to the question, “What is your favorite food?” (It was pizza.) With 10 tries, an attacker would have a 39 percent chance of guessing a Korean-speaking user’s answer to the question, “What is your city of birth?” and a 43 percent chance of guessing the favorite food.

The ride-hailing service is known for its aggressive approach to business. It’s what helped propel it to nearly a $70 billion valuation and get it into the more than 70 countries where it now operates. But that approach has begun to backfire, as a series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder.

Chief Financial Officer Vacant after Brent Callinicos left in 2015. Chief Technology Officer Thuan Pham, a tech entrepreneur who joined in 2013. Uber executives have faced repeated accusations of turning a blind eye to sexual harassment and other corporate misbehavior. During that time, more than 20 people have been fired or left the company. Three out of eight traditional C-suite jobs are unfilled, not to mention several other senior-level positions. Mr. Kalanick, who has overseen the company since its founding in 2009, resigned as chief executive after pressure from investors to change company culture. Mr. Kalanick’s resignation opens questions of who may take over Uber, especially since the company has been so molded in his image. Ryan Graves One of Uber’s first employees and now the senior vice president of operations. Daniel Graf Charged with overseeing the company’s growth after questions were raised about his predecessor's behavior. Thuan Pham Believed to be under scrutiny for what has been seen as shortcomings in listening to employee complaints. Eric Alexander Fired over his handling of an investigation of a rape committed in India by a driver. Emil Michael Once encouraged staffers to investigate reporters who were aggressively covering the company. As he has grown the company, Mr. Kalanick has relied upon a close-knit group of confidants known as the “A-Team.” The name referred to a coterie of Uber’s top executives who were among some of the company’s early employees and had some of the same aggressive sensibilities as Mr. Kalanick.

She was already an investor but her presence as a company director has allowed her to weigh in on several issues plaguing the company, including the need for a more diverse work force and to foster a climate where intimidation and harassment is not tolerated. She, in many ways, has increasingly become the public voice of the company. But changing the company culture may prove to be challenging. Mr. Bonderman, who became a board member when his firm, TPG Capital, invested in Uber, resigned from the board after making a sexist remark at a staff meeting intended to address the issues endemic in the company’s workplace. Mr. Bonderman’s seat was replaced by another TPG partner, the same day that Bill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark who was an early supporter of Mr. Kalanick, stepped down.

At Apple’s annual conference for software developers this week, the iPhone maker announced brand-new iPads, iMacs and MacBooks along with a smart speaker featuring its voice assistant Siri. Apple also demonstrated new versions of its operating systems powering the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. Curious about Apple’s announcements? Submit your questions here, and Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, will respond to some of the most notable ones.
 I have some questions about HomePod. 1. Do I have to own an iPhone to have the HomePod? 2. Will they release an SDK, or software development kit,  for developers to build on? 3. Given that the HomePod is a home device, and people won't be able do the ""status bling bling thing,"" will Apple be able to sustain a play in this category or are they going to have the HomePod  just so that they will be able to say that they have one of those doodads? Apple shared very few details about HomePod, its new smart speaker. But here’s what we know about how the device works:  1. Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, will primarily work with Apple Music. 2. The device will also play audio that is streamed over Wi-Fi from an iPhone using AirPlay, which means you can stream music from third-party apps like Spotify or Pandora to the speaker as long as you have an iPhone.  It’s highly unlikely that you will need an iPhone to use HomePod, but you will probably need at least an Apple Music account if you lack an iPhone.  Regarding an SDK, Apple did not announce one for HomePod this week. But it’s reasonable to expect one in the future. As for whether HomePod will be successful, we will have to wait and see. The device’s $329 price tag is exceptionally higher than Amazon’s $180 Echo and Google’s $129 Home. But HomePod’s price is on par with the $299 Sonos Play:3. The Sonos products -- multispeaker systems designed to be spread throughout various rooms in the house -- are the most similar to HomePod, and the people who are willing to spend so much on Sonos products may be willing to splurge on HomePod. Are there any proposed upgrades to the iPad Mini, which is the entry-level and smallest iPad? There were no updates for the iPad Mini at Monday’s event. In March, Apple refreshed its iPad Mini 4, which was released in 2015, with larger storage capacity (128 gigabytes). Apple has said its larger 9.7-inch iPad tablet has been its hottest seller, so you can expect Apple to minimize updates for the smaller model in the future. Regarding the iPad Pro, why does Apple persist in not providing trackpad capability? This seems irrational to me.Without a trackpad/mouse capability, the device is not useful for those professionals who use spreadsheet software primarily. De facto, this then leaves out a very large portion of the professional user group - financial, engineering other related technical users.Touching that screen interminably in not going to cut it for these users. Your thoughts?  Adding a trackpad to the iPad would practically turn it into a PC. Apple continues to distinguish its Mac and iPad products with user interfaces that rely on different ways to control them. Its Macs are controlled with a mouse and physical keyboard, and its iPads are primarily controlled with a touchscreen. However, to your point, the iPad is increasingly resembling the Mac, especially now that a physical keyboard is practically a must-buy if you get an iPad Pro. In addition, there is now a virtual trackpad mode in iPad: touch two fingers down on the keyboard to bring up a digital trackpad on the screen. What is the scoop on the iPhone 8? Are there any advancements and are they significant? The past few models appear to represent a plateau in the phone’s development. There have been some software upgrades but besides the camera nothing big. What do you think? According to multiple sources, the next iPhone will reduce the borders, or bezel, surrounding the screen — so you will get a larger display in a compact body. This is the current design trend in the smartphone industry. The LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8, which were released this year, also featured thinner bezels. I have been debating whether or not an iPad Pro is a worthy investment ever since I acquired my MacBook Pro about a year ago. With iOS 11, would you argue that the iPad Pro can adequately perform as a 'substitute' laptop for those days when lugging a MacBook around isn't as appealing? Could you briefly recap what iOS 11 means for the iPad Pro world in terms of its functionality as an everyday work device? The iPad’s operating system is increasingly resembling that of a Mac. Most significantly, iOS 11 will include a file directory that lets you manage files similar to the Finder system on Mac. In addition, iOS 11 includes the ability to drag and drop items between multiple app screens, similar to the desktop interface of interacting with apps inside multiple windows. As for whether or not the iPad Pro replaces an everyday work computer, the jury is still out. We will have to wait and see when iOS 11 is officially released in fall, as well as what apps are available for iPad.  Other than software, personally what makes me gravitate toward a laptop for work is simply what the word implies: it can sit on top of my lap more comfortably. Apple offers a detachable keyboard for iPad Pro, but a laptop’s attached keyboard is always going to feel more solid and stable. Will there come a time when iPad Pro can run Photoshop? The iPad Pro already runs Photoshop apps — just not the exact same software as what you are used to on a desktop. Adobe tailored its software to be more suitable for mobile devices. Examples include iPad apps like Photoshop Express, Adobe Lightroom and PhotoShop Sketch. Is there any hope that Apple will move to support its professional users, perhaps by totally rethinking the design and upgradability of the Mac towers? Many of the announcements at the Apple conference were aimed at professional customers. Apple debuted a new iMac Pro, for one, which starts at $4,999 and can support up to an 18-core processor. Apple also once again upgraded its iPad Pro, its tablet for professionals. As for the Mac Pro tower, which is currently shaped like a cylinder, Apple has not updated that computer for nearly four years. In recent interviews with the news media, the company said the computer was a failure and that it was working on “something great to replace it.” Hi, Brian. I was looking at the MacBook Pro and when I saw the charger, only one question came to mind: What would Steve Jobs say, especially considering the commercials (Hi, I'm a Mac / I'm a PC) featured a PC in a wheelchair after being injured when someone tripped on the cord and pulled him off the desk? You are referring to Apple’s shift to USB-C, the modern standard for USB, and away from its proprietary magnetic charging port called MagSafe. Among many complaints, this was one of the most controversial changes about the new MacBook Pros.  Based on conversations with employees, my understanding is that Apple made this decision for a number of reasons:  1. The MacBook Pro batteries last so long now, so how often are you sitting around with the cord plugged into the computer anyway?  2. The laptops keep getting lighter and lighter, and at some point tripping over the cord might still pull the computer off the desk even if it’s connected with a magnet;  3. The accessories industry is slowly transitioning into using USB-C for video, audio and power, so might as well go all in on this port now.  (Personally, I will miss MagSafe as well and I still prefer the MacBook Air in part because of that charging port.) Anything on the Mac Mini? It’s easy to forget about the Mac Mini — the tiny box-shaped desktop computer -- which has not been upgraded since 2014. There were no updates for the mini computer announced at Monday’s event, but in recent press interviews, Apple said the Mac Mini remains part of its portfolio, and it did not announce any plans to discontinue the device. In other words, there might be improvements made to the computer eventually, but it’s tough to say when. Can I get some iMac advice? I’m trying to gauge when to replace my current iMac, but unsure whom to trust. The new standard iMacs ship this week and the next Mac operating system comes out this fall. It would be perfectly fine for you to get the new iMac now and download the next Mac system, a free update called High Sierra, when it arrives this fall.  However, be wary that brand-new operating systems often have bugs, so I would advise you to wait a few months after High Sierra’s release to make sure the coast is clear. And as always, make sure to back up your data before you upgrade to the next operating system. I need a new laptop. Should I wait? If you are considering an Apple laptop, now is the time to get one. Apple refreshed each of its laptops: The MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro all got updates this week with improvements like speed increases. We probably will not see another update to the MacBook line for at least another year.   Advertisement",9181

 Which 20 venture capitalists — the investors who unearth the tiny start-ups that turn into tomorrow’s behemoths — are on the winningest streaks? To identify today’s top venture investors, CB Insights, a research firm that follows the venture capital industry, produced a data-driven list.  To compile it, CB Insights looked at factors such as connectedness, since people with access to the best information hear about hot companies first; and exits, meaning the returns after a start-up is sold or goes public.

We responded to readers about Facebook, smartphones, 5G and more.
  Hey there! I’m Mark, the European technology correspondent for The New York Times. I’m tasked with keeping tabs on all things tech across the Continent and, sometimes, beyond. I’m in Barcelona for Mobile World Congress, a weeklong powwow of company bigwigs, senior politicians and tech start-ups, and I’m excited to answer your questions. Ask me about anything – the future of 5G mobile networks, the fight over net neutrality, the latest mobile devices or what the likes of Facebook and Netflix are up to. Just send in your questions below, and I’ll be back on Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern time to answer them. I’ve spent the weekend criss-crossing Barcelona, attending news conferences, meeting executives, eating my weight in tapas and hanging out at landmarks like the Plaça de Catalunya, below. (Yes, it’s a hard life.) But my initial sense from this year’s Mobile World Congress is “meh.” For sure, there are fancy new phones, internet-connected gadgets (including, for some unknown reason, a toothbrush with artificial intelligence) and enough driverless car demos to sink a battleship, but much of the technology on show is an incremental step forward from what’s already out there. In short, there’s no “iPhone moment” as in 2007, when the product’s release set off a dramatic shift in how we all use phones. That’s mostly because the mobile technology world is in a state of flux. Many of the world’s carriers are still trying to figure out how to make money from the increasing use of mobile data, while also investing the billions of dollars required for high-speed networks to stream the likes of Netflix and Hulu on our phones. Annoyingly, such changes take time. So while this year’s gathering in Barcelona will have a few surprises, my take is that this is a year of transition, not of revolution. 

 Hola from Barcelona, and welcome to this Q. and A.  I’m Mark, the European technology correspondent for The New York Times, and I’m looking forward to answering your questions.  Thanks to those of you who sent in questions early; we’ve received more than 100 responses over the last three days. I’ll be answering some of those while also taking your live questions during the chat. Be gentle. I’ve just rushed over from a Facebook news conference – not a company that you would typically expect to see at a trade event dominated by cellphone carriers and cable operators. Yet the social network has spent years cultivating ties with these companies, signing deals with many of them in the developing world to offer Facebook’s suite of services, among others, for next to nothing. (For the backstory, take a look at this dispatch from India by my colleague Vindu Goel). Facebook is already one of the world’s most important companies. And  that power will only grow with its growing interest in making the internet work (The company tried to launch a satellite last year to offer connectivity across Africa, but the rocket blew up during launch). There are still some serious questions still left unanswered: what are Facebook’s motivations, beyond bringing the internet to the masses, and what type of internet is Mark Zuckerberg helping to create? This is definitely an area to keep tabs on. Best phone at the MWC is? I guess that depends on how you define “best.” The likes of Sony and Huawei, a Chinese brand, both came out with high-end phones with fancy high-definition displays and enough processing power to support a small village. But these aren’t transformative. They’re incremental changes. A number of device makers here also are going after the low end of the market, trying to break the $50-$75 price barrier that would make smartphones accessible to the burgeoning middle class across Africa, Asia and Latin America. These phones are arguably are more powerful than the iPhone was when it was first released in 2007, but they pale in comparison to the latest Android or iOS phone. Indeed, it shows you what a funk the phone industry is in when the most talked-about phone in Barcelona is one based on a device released in 2000: Nokia’s 3310, a so-called dumb feature phone with no internet connectivity. Will that be a success? My quick answer is no: Why buy one of those when you can get a low-end smartphone for just a little more money? But its unveiling here certainly got the nostalgia flowing for when Nokia was the big beast in the phone world. Will the wearables trend flame out? Are watches just a fad? I, like many others, was super excited when smartwatches hit the market. But as my Pebble smartwatch sits in my bedroom collecting dust, these devices haven’t caught on like many had expected – despite the sale of millions of Apple Watches each year. There’s a new bunch of smartwatches on show at the Mobile World Congress, but the biggest selling point is that the batteries of these new devices will last up to a month. That longevity, however, requires turning off almost all of the “connected’”services: So companies have basically created, well, a normal watch, but one with a $400 price tag. Going forward, I see wearables taking on different forms, moving away from traditional watches to jewelry, eyewear or something completely different. Basically, a wearable that doesn’t feel like a big piece of technology sitting on your wrist. I’d welcome that. We’re just at the start of 2017, but for companies like BlackBerry and Nokia, it might as well be 2009. Both brands are making big splashes this year at Mobile World Congress, unveiling a stable of new phones in the hopes of tapping into nostalgia for a time when both names were still big in the mobile world. This isn’t what you might think, though. Instead of building the phones themselves, Nokia and BlackBerry have licensed their brands to others, basically outsourcing the production of these (Android) phones to reduce costs and avoid the mistakes of the past. These once-popular cellphone makers fell well behind Samsung and Apple; BlackBerry currently has zero percent of the global smartphone market, according to Gartner, a research firm. For tech specs on these new phones, see here and here. It’s hard to see these “zombie phone brands” coming back from the dead. Yes, there are (a small number of) people who would want a BlackBerry and Nokia phone. But can they bring back the good old days? That ship has sailed. When will longer testing batteries be available? Ones that don’t catch fire! You’ve hit on the holy grail of mobile technology, and it has come up a lot at the Mobile World Congress. Samsung’s recent problems with Galaxy Note 7s that kept catching fire are only one example of how batteries have become a major obstacle to advancement in smartphones. How long will it take to get longer-lasting batteries? It’s hard to say, though my colleague John Markoff wrote recently about “solid state” lithium batteries that could be safer and give engineers greater flexibility. People here in Barcelona say that’s years away. It’s worth remembering that this problem isn’t new. Here’s what Thomas Edison had to say in 1883: “The storage battery is one of those peculiar things which appeal to the imagination, and no more perfect thing could be desired by stock swindlers than that very selfsame thing.” How soon 5G infrastructure and terminals can be commissioned into commercial service ? Before we get started, here’s a refresher: “5G” is a new type of mobile technology that could eventually allow us to download high-definition movies to our smartphones and other devices in just a few seconds, among other benefits. (For more on 5G, check out an article that I wrote last year.) You’ll start to hear more about 5G this year when AT&T, Verizon Wireless and other carriers worldwide start trials of the technology. But be careful with these boasts. The tests aren’t really 5G because the standards for how the technology will work haven’t been agreed to, and much of the geeky mobile infrastructure that’s needed to make these superfast networks work hasn’t been built yet. Even industry watchers and executives here in Barcelona admit that 5G networks are still three to five years away, at least when it comes to a widespread rollout. Sure, we’ll get test projects here and there – countries are making big investments to offer “5G-style” services around events like the World Cup or Olympics –  but everyday use of 5G won’t happen before 2020, at the earliest. When do see the VR devices from sony and others really taking off for the mass market?  Are mobile phone makers already positioning themselves to bring a mobile device to market with more immersive accessories?  All device makers (from Samsung and Sony to lesser known brands) are working to get virtual reality devices into customers’ hands. So far, it’s been a tough sell. The technology is still temperamental, and users’ initial (bad) experiences with the technology have put off the mass adoption of these weird-looking devices. Another issue is content. Having an expensive headset is all well and good. But if there’s nothing to use it on beyond a handful of high-profile video games, then that’s just another reason to pass on virtual reality. My view is that virtual reality will stay a niche product until someone figures out how to not only offer better equipment at cheaper prices, but also to give people the content – games, movies or something else – they will want to interact with. Concerned about new F.C.C. head overturning Obama net neutrality law. … How can we change that and protect net neutrality? First, here are the CliffsNotes on net neutrality: Rules passed in 2015 by the Federal Communications Commission, the American telecommunication regulator, required internet service providers to treat all online traffic equally (for more details, check out this video). Ajit Pai, the new F.C.C. chairman, is to speak here in Barcelona tomorrow. There’s growing concern that he may rein in net neutrality protections in the U.S., allowing internet providers to sign deals with companies to offer digital services like movie streaming at faster speeds than those offered by rivals. Yet such changes would take years and are unlikely to undo all of the current rules. While Mr. Pai is no fan of the current standards  – he voted against them in 2015 – he has also said that he believes in an “open and free internet.” So expect any changes – and there will be changes – to be more nuanced than both sides currently expect. Live streaming from mobile. Is this going to continue to dominate or is it going to be a fad like 3D TV The answer to this question depends on whom you talk to. Facebook and Twitter, for example, are betting much of their future growth on live streaming from cellphones, so they are doing all that they can to make us try video streaming – including paying celebrities and media organizations, including The New York Times, to use these streaming video services. But for the average person, I see the future of live video in more personal terms. That could be sending a video to group of family members on WhatsApp, or something similar to your partner on SnapChat. For me, that adds value beyond a one-time use of Facebook Live, which still feels pretty gimmicky. Will live streaming be the next 3-D TV? No. But will it become a must-have? The jury’s still out.


 Thanks for all your great questions, and apologies to those of you we didn’t get to.  I’m now heading off to the conference’s main auditorium, where Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive, is about to give a speech that I’m expecting will touch on several issues that we’ve talked about over the last hour. Mr. Hastings is just one of the growing number of television and digital content executives who now attend the Mobile World Congress each year, a sign that the worlds of telecommunications and content are increasingly becoming intertwined.  How does that work? Well, here’s something I wrote about Netflix’s close ties with carriers and cable operators worldwide, and how such connections have helped the streaming service expand rapidly around the globe. Thanks for spending the last hour with me. ¡Hasta pronto! Advertisement",12238

Tech reporter Brian X. Chen answered questions about what’s in store for consumer tech 2017.
  Hey there. I’m Brian, the lead consumer technology writer (which is a flattering way to say I’m the only consumer tech writer on staff for The Times). I’m here at CES, and I’m excited to take your questions about all things tech. Anything from 4K TV and drones to wireless battery charging and how “smart homes” actually work, just send in your questions below and I’ll be back on Friday at 1 p.m. EST to answer them. 
To get up to speed, here’s a quick rundown of tech trends at the show:    Photo        What to Know About CES 2017  A look at the trends that will matter at this week’s International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: Ultra HD TV, smart home and drones.   The New York Times     A look at the trends that will matter at this week’s International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: Ultra HD TV, smart home and drones. The New York Times Ready to rock and roll! I’ve survived day one of CES.  Ask me anything. Carlos Silva - Brazil  Hello, Sir! I have two questions. First one, what is CES? What could you tell us about 4K TV? It’s pretty ironic but not surprising at all that consumers aren’t aware of what the Consumer Electronics Show is. In a nut, it’s a networking event for tech companies and buyers (such as Best Buy) who are assessing what to put on their shelves this year. 

Lots of tech reporters attend the show to catch a glimpse of what might be coming in the future, but the reality is that the vast majority of what is shown at CES will never hit store shelves because the items are too gimmicky or tough to sell. To answer your second question, it’s basically a resolution that is quadruple the resolution of its predecessor, 1080p. Last year I said it was best to wait to buy a 4K TV because the content available to watch in 4K was very limited and underwhelming and prices were still high.    Photo        Despite the CES Hype, It’s Better to Wait on That 4K TV  Advice for those thinking about buying a 4K television, also called Ultra HD, which has a higher resolution than the current high-definition 1080p TV sets.   The New York Times     This year I’m OK with recommending buying one because prices have dropped a lot (you could spend around $800 for a great 4K TV or $1,300 for an exceptional one) and the content situation has improved, especially on Netflix where I think all its originals are encoded in 4K. Still, if you have an older TV and there’s nothing wrong with it, the longer you can wait to buy a new one, the better. Advice for those thinking about buying a 4K television, also called Ultra HD, which has a higher resolution than the current high-definition 1080p TV sets. The New York Times Rick Merritt - San Jose, CA  Hi Brian. CES is famous for surprises and quirky new ideas that can sometimes be pretty interesting. See anything like that? For sure. I saw some pretty ridiculous gadgets yesterday, including a “smart mattress” that repositions itself as you toss and turn at night. If your partner snores, you can raise a part of the mattress to tilt their head and make them stop snoring. You get the picture: It sounds like a nightmare and a terrible product. There’s a video of it here: https://t.co/Jz96T2sA5Q Hi Brian, I’ve been putting off buying a 4K TV because I’m also interested to see if 4K projector technology will become cheap enough to compete with TV’s anytime soon. Is it reasonable to keep waiting or should I just go for one of the 4K TV’s coming out this hear? This is a great question. The Wirecutter, the product recommendations site that we own, spotted a 4K projector on the show floor: the Optoma UHD60 DLP projector will cost $2800 when it becomes available in May or June of this year. Keep an eye on this one: I think it might suit your needs. Is the DJI Magic the next big thing in drones, like what is the best drone right now? Are there any other drone makers besides DJI that can compete with the inspire 2. Not counting fully custom rigs.  To answer both your questions, right now DJI is the most trusted brand in the drone industry. Its closest competitor, 3D Robotics, recently pivoted to focus on commercial drones. And as you probably know, GoPro had to recall its Karma drone last year because of a malfunction causing drones to fall out of the sky, but it still plans to sell drones. There are lots of cheap drones here at CES from unknown Chinese brands, but who knows what their customer service and warranty policies are?  In other words, when it comes to making a confident purchase with a reputed brand that offers a decent warranty, DJI is probably the way to go for now. What technologies are advertisers most focused on there? It’s tough to say because I don’t interview advertisers  but my gut says smart home and AI are hot this year. Amazon’s Alexa is the star of this show. I’ve seen a refrigerator, an oven and a robovacuum that all work with Alexa. Ramesh - Fremont, CA  How do “smart homes” actually work? So “smart home” is just a term used to describe internet-connected home appliances like lighting systems, security cameras, locks and doorbells. The products vary on how they work. Some require a hub that you connect to your Wi-Fi router so that the product can talk to the hub to pull an internet connection: the Philips Hue lighting system is a good example. Other products have internet connectivity built into the product itself. The major trend is that tech giants and smart home product makers are working together to make voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Google’s Home control smart home products. You can say something like “Alexa, turn off the lights” or “Siri, lock the door.” Voice assistants are making it much easier for average people to control smart home products, which is great news. Has CES lost its spark? I remember being so excited to see all the new media devices and video players debut. Now I don’t even know what to look forward to. I’d say so. CES and trade shows in general (including Macworld Expo) have lost a lot of heft. Tech companies enjoy unveiling and releasing products on their own schedule and promoting them with their own tools including social media. So in the last five years or so CES has ceased to be a venue of major tech news and has evolved into more of a networking event between tech companies, retailers and media. That said, it’s not a total lost cause. I’d say CES is a nice way to get a peek at what’s coming for TVs if you’re interested in buying a new TV this holiday season, or home appliances like refrigerators. Can you tell us about any virtual assistants on the market this year? Anything new and different? (This can extend to smart homes too) Hi, Aly. I didn’t see any new virtual assistants announced here, but what’s interesting is that so many companies are teaming up with Amazon’s Alexa to build compatibility with the Amazon Echo. As I mentioned to another reader, think smart refrigerators, robo vacuums and more. That’s definitely exciting for virtual assistants in general, and it seems Amazon is going to lead the pack when it comes to smart home accessories. Seems like mesh networking has arrived in earnest. Previously limited to the military, it’s everywhere at CES – from mesh-enabled wifi like Eero to off-grid long-range mesh like goTenna Mesh. Are you bullish? John, I do like mesh networking. Setting up multiple access points throughout the home makes sense in an era when we carry multiple internet-connected devices around the home, including tablets and smartphones. I like how systems like Eero and Google Wifi use apps that make it easy for people with little technical know-how to set up a mesh network. Is all the hype about Alexa’s new integrations in partner products substantiated in your opinion? What do you think the coolest new voice or AI product is? Joanna, there is definitely a lot of hype around Alexa and home products. I do think some of these products will fade away because they are gimmicky. I can’t imagine needing Alexa to control a smart refrigerator, for instance. I do think the more boring stuff like lighting kits have more potential in the long term:  when things become boring in the tech industry, they are maturing. Hi, what is the difference between OLED and HDR. I hear these terms thrown around all of the time as the future of TV’s, but what do they actually mean and are they worth investing? Tanner, OLED, for organic LED, is a pixel technology for the screen. HDR, for high dynamic range, is a  software feature that enhances the color and contrast of  a picture. The consensus right now is that OLED TVs look better than anything on the market, and HDR does make videos look more vibrant and vivid. I would add that OLED TVs are also the most expensive on the market. LG’s 65-incher last year, for example, cost around $5,000. Are any products focusing on consumer privacy issues that arise out of “smart home” technologies? Meeki, regarding consumer privacy issues in the smart home, I think Apple is probably the most focused on this. It’s a bit more complex for smart home accessory makers to make devices compatible with Apple’s HomeKit framework, because it sometimes requires embedding custom chips that communicate with an Apple device via an encrypted channel. With Apple removing the headphone jack on the latest products, are the other companies going to follow and force us to go 100% Bluetooth?  What happens to my old corded devices like my Bose headphones? Frank, from what I saw, there weren’t any major smartphones unveiled at CES, so it’s tough to tell. I do think companies like Samsung will follow suit with high-end smartphones and move away from the headphone jack in order to compete with Apple. But I think lower-end phones will always have the headphone jack. What are you seeing in terms of AR glasses, there is lots of promises. Anything of interest on the show floor ?  Gus, the focus on this year’s CES continues to be on virtual reality, not so much AR. The upshot is that VR is poised to get cheaper this year. Lenovo showed a headset at CES for less than $400, which is much cheaper than the HTC Vive, which cost $800. Is anyone talking about security or privacy when it comes to the Internet of Things? Aseem, in my conversations with smart home accessory makers, they seem to think that the concerns about security will shift away from DDOS attacks and more toward concern about the tech giants and their business models. For example, consumers might be more skeptical about what Google is doing with the data you share with it when using an always-on speaker like Google Home. Are there any new remarkable household robots? Anything that combines Alexa-like capabilities and house-hold robots? Jon, yes, there was an Alexa-controlled robovacuum from Samsung.  http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/28/14099720/samsung-powerbot-vr7000-robot-vacuum-cleaner-amazon-echo Still, I question how useful that would be. Do you get the sense that curved TVs are sticking around, or are they a gimmick most of us will have forgotten about in 10 years? Steve, I don’t like curved TVs. I tested a Samsung curved television in my home for weeks and it just looked ridiculous, and there were no benefits to the screen being curved. I do hope that consumers avoid buying them so that they go away. Brian - any interesting consumer trends you can gather based on what is being shown most there? Eliot, the most relevant trend I see is that 4K is getting close to replacing 1080p. The next TV you buy will probably be a 4K set, whether you care about 4K or not. The 1080P television sets that manufacturers continue to sell have low-quality features, so 1080P is quickly becoming obsolete. The other relevant trend I see is that home appliance makers are getting more adventurous with the so-called “internet of things” - that is, hooking up appliances like ovens, refrigerators and vacuum cleaners to the internet. Personally I would love to have an internet-controlled oven to preheat the oven before I come home, but I wonder how many of these products will be gimmicks that consumers don’t care for. Hi Brian! What companies should I keep an eye for when it comes to some sweet new camera tech? Anna, there weren’t very many announcements about cameras at CES. Panasonic introduced the GH5 mirrorless camera, which includes 4K video, among other features. The Wirecutter highlighted that camera and a few other products from CES that might realistically be worth buying in this post: http://thewirecutter.com/blog/some-things-we-might-buy-in-2017-a-realists-guide-to-ces/ When does Google wifi router actually ship? and how does the new Linksys velop router launched at CES compare? Shanx, Google Wifi is already shipping. But I thought it was a pretty slow router and the Eero is better. The Linksys Velop looks very similar and I’ll probably test it alongside other mesh systems when I can get my hands on it. What do you think will be the most disruptive innovation in day-to-day life that was seen at CES? Meg, hmm, disruptive innovation…I think the most impactful innovation at CES is probably the least disruptive kind. That is, when technology gets more commonplace and “boring,” it is the best time to buy it because technology companies have taken years to work out all the kinks. The example I would give is mesh networking. Wi-Fi is really boring stuff, but still a common headache for everyone, and mesh networking helps solve that problem. Our company is considering to purchase a drone to record our trees from up above, which company would you recommend? TreeWorld, I would probably take a look at DJI. As I mentioned to other readers, it’s one of the more trusted drone makers. Did you notice any trends towards greater accuracy in wearable sensors (e.g. heart rate, etc)? Dan, I have seen that wearable makers are starting to focus on heart rate instead of step counts. The theory is that heartrate can tell us much more about your health whereas step counts just give you an approximation on calories burned. Anything TRULY new in the smart phone world in 2017? WX, new smartphones from the biggest phone companies — Samsung and Apple — get announced later in the year. Samsung usually announces a new Galaxy flagship around March, and Apple typically introduces new iPhones in September. The two companies continue to dominate the phone market, but in China there are lots of compelling new devices coming from Xiaomi and Huawei, though these usually get announced around March at the trade show Mobile World Congress. Thoughts on the RAZER laptop with two horizontal fold-out screens (total of 3 screens)?  Well-built?  Laptop performance? SF Architect, the Razer is an interesting concept but I’m skeptical about its commercial success. Will gamers buy it? Maybe, but why not just buy a desktop computer? It weighs 11 pounds, which is going to be a pain for people like architects to carry around from site to site.

Runa Sandvik, The New York Times’s director of information security in the newsroom, and Nicole Perlroth, who writes about cybersecurity and privacy, answered reader questions about cybersecurity and protecting personal data online. Read the full transcript below.
  Hello! I’m Runa, the Director of Information Security for the Newsroom at The New York Times. What questions do you have about information security and how to protect yourself online?  Please submit your questions in advance and we’ll answer some of them during tomorrow’s chat.  Hi, I’m Nicole and I cover all things cybersecurity and hacking for The Times. I’m looking forward to your questions and hearing about how you have dealt with your issues around data protection. Hi everyone - we’ll be starting our chat shortly. Nicole is unfortunately running late, but we’re looking forward to answering your questions! Should I buy a 2FA token or continue using my mobile phone to secure my account? How would you describe to my tech-illiterate relatives the importance of securing their email accounts?  Marc - I usually say that not securing an online account is like not having a lock on your front door. The better the lock, the harder it is to get in. Describing the importance of security to others is all about figuring out what matters most to them; sometimes it’s more about access to content and not so much encryption and security and privacy. Besides a firewall and anti-virus software, do you recommend encrypting a harddrive as an extra measure against cyber crime? Andrew - that’s a great question! Encrypting your hard drive will protect data stored locally on the drive if the computer is ever lost, stolen or seized. To protect data you have stored in the cloud, I recommend that you consider good passwords and two-factor authentication where possible. Without giving away too much, can you tell us what security protections NY Times reporters take in their communications? Especially with sources.  Charles - earlier today we launched a tips page with secure communication channels for sources. This page (https://nytimes.com/tips) tells sources how to reach us on Signal, WhatsApp, SecureDrop, via encrypted email and postal mail. In short, we are familiar with and frequently use various secure communication tools to ensure that we protect our communications, data, and sources.  I am one of the unfortunate yahoo users. To update “security” they are asking for my phone number and another email.  Isnt this just foolish to give to the site?  What else can I do?  What happens if you shut down an account (which I have never tried to do) Rosie - I’m sorry to hear you were affected by the Yahoo breach! If you’re not confident that the provider can protect the additional information it is now asking for, you may want to consider other providers. The provider will still have all the contents you’ve given up so far, but at the very least you won’t give up more going forward. If your browser asks, “Do you want to remember this password?” what should you choose? Julie - instead of relying on a single browser to remember passwords for you, I recommend you look into a password manager instead. The password manager will help you create and remember good, unique passwords for all your sites and services. By using a password manager, you can access your passwords from any computer, regardless of the browser you are using. Can I make a new e-mail account and transfer all data to the new address for protection? Waheed - you could technically create as many email addresses as you want, but the bigger question here is what you’re trying to protect yourself or the emails from? If the emails are already with a provider, moving to a different provider isn’t going to change the fact that the first one already has access. What can I do AFTER finding my e-mail was hacked? Waheed - in situations where one of your online accounts have already been hacked, it is highly recommended that you secure the account as best as you can. This means changing the password, setting up two-factor authentication (if possible), reviewing active sessions and devices for anything suspicious (that is, for devices and activity you don’t recognize). Is it really realistic at this point to think it is possible to protect one’s personal information from being hacked?? Joan - within the information security community we always say that nothing is 100% secure. What’s important is that you consider how the service will use the information you’re providing; this is essentially information that you are trusting the service with, information that could leak at some point in the future. This is true not only for emails, but for social media, messages, etc. How do I validate an email from my email provider telling me I need to change my password if there is a chance it is a hacker? Liz - some phishing emails look very realistic and it can be hard to tell a phish from a real email. A few things to look out for include; is the sender someone you recognize? did the email come from the provider itself? if you hover over the link in the email, does it point to the domain owned by the provider? If you receive an email requesting that you change your password, I suggest you open a new tab in your browser, go directly to the email provider’s website and change your password there. Do not use the link in the email to do so. What is a 2 FA token Patrick - good question! 2FA is short for “two-factor authentication.” That’s when you use your username, password and a random code that, say, your phone has generated to log on to your account. In this case, your phone is the ‘token’ that generates the code. You can also receive the code via SMS, or you can use a hardware token, such as a YubiKey (looks like a tiny USB stick). Can you suggest a password manager?  There are so many to remember. Bryan - a password manager is a great option if you’re looking for ways to create and remember good, unique passwords for all your services. I highly recommend you look at 1Password, Dashlane and LastPass. Hi, do you recommend storing files on a separate drive to protect from ransomeware? Marc - I’ll always recommend creating backups of data you care about, whether you’re concerned about ransomware specifically or something different. For many, cloud services are great for backing up content. If you don’t want to put your data in the cloud, using an external hard drive is a great alternative. Are we really protected by secured apps if a hack were to happen? Barb - when we talk about secure messaging apps and what they can do for us, it is important to remember that while the apps may not provide 100% security or any guarantees, they do protect a bigger portion of the communications than if we didn’t use the apps. With Signal, for example, the app will encrypt the contents of the messages (and calls) and the service does not retain any metadata about the who and when and how often.  Open Whisper Systems received a subpoena for information on its Signal app subscribers and an order not to talk about it, a practice Microsoft and others say is too prevalent, and unconstitutional. The New York Times A billion were hacked; out of how many? How do I know if I’ve been hacked? William - I believe Yahoo is currently notifying users who were affected by the most recent breach. If you have not received such a notice, I’d still advice you to change the password on your account (and anywhere else where you’ve used the same password) and set up two-factor authentication where possible. This is true not just for Yahoo and email in general, but for any other account that you have. Are password managers like keychain and lasspass really a good idea? Doesn’t this just mean that a hacker has to crack/discover/fish one password to get access to all your passwords? John - you’re asking a good question and I understand it may seem a bit backwards to put all your passwords in the cloud, hope the provider doesn’t get hacked and trust us all when we say this is better than not using a password manager. Realistically, using a password manager with a good, unique master password is better than not using one. If you’re not using one, you’re likely to start re-using passwords at some point and that’s far from ideal. Hello readers! Nicole Perlroth, cybersecurity reporter for the New York Times here. Sorry I’m late! Excited to jump in and answer your questions. Is there any way to permanently delete old messages from email and social media accounts? Cynthia - deleting content means that it’s no longer available to you or anyone who gains access to your accounts. The majority of service providers out there do retain content, however, even if you have deleted it yourself. Something to keep in mind depending on whether your concern is a hacker or someone taking legal action. I am a CEO concerned about protecting my employees’ emails in the wake of this Yahoo attack. What can I do to prevent them from reusing passwords? Is 2FA an option for me?  Larry, Your best defense is to encourage employees to enable two-factor authentication and to set policies that force employees to change up their passwords every 90 days or so. You are bound to hear some gripes, but some complaining is much preferred to having your data in the hands of hackers. Are firewalls such as Sonicwall effective in preventing hacking? Jerry - a firewall is one tool in the security toolbox that can help you protect your network and the devices on it. There is sadly no one tool that can defend against all possible attacks. Keep in mind that you also need to secure all your online accounts - we’ve talked a bit about use of two-factor authentication and password managers as starting points for doing so. Jerry- Firewalls are never a bad idea. But I put them in the same bucket as antivirus software, in that they make it harder for hackers, but are not a cure-all. It’s important to layer on other security defenses, like two factor authentication for email, to protect your data. Is it true that most SMS message apps are easily read by outside parties, but that Signal cannot be? I heard iPhones are encrypted. Should I be using Signal anyway? Nicole has a good point here about the iPhone and the Signal messaging app; the iPhone does encrypt the data stored locally, but does by default not do anything for your communications using the phone. That’s where apps such as Signal come in; the app will encrypt your messages and your calls, and the service is designed to retain as little metadata as possible. Correction 12/16/16: Suggesting that the iPhone does not do anything to protect your communications is an oversight on my part. iOS does, by default, use end-to-end encryption for messages sent using iMessage from one iPhone to another. In addition, FaceTime will encrypt audio and video calls by default. If you are communicating with someone who does not have an iPhone, however, it is recommended that you use an app such as Signal to ensure end-to-end encryption. — Runa Arne and Rosie had similar questions about protecting text messages from snoopers. iPhone content is encrypted and harder for hackers to intercept, but I also recommend that people use secure, encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Wickr for more sensitive communications. Runa, you said to use an external hard drive to protect data from ransomware. Doesn’t ransomware take all drives connected to the computer hostage? Phil - you’re correct in saying the ransomware will grab whatever is on the local drive and any attached devices. What you could do is either use the cloud to back up your data or use a hard drive that you attach, back up the data on, detach and store somewhere safe. George - it can sometimes be difficult to tell a fake email from a legit one, and the people behind these emails are getting more and more creative with how they do it. Sometimes they create fake domain names that look just like the real ones you’re expecting to see, other times the contents of the email is almost exactly the same as what the real company would send out (minus a spelling mistake or two). A great piece on what it’s like to have your accounts hacked is this one from Mat Honan https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/ I’m still unconvinced about using a password manager, in effect ‘putting all your eggs in one basket’- it seems like these companies would be prime targets for hackers. How long before we hear of one of these 'vaults’ being hacked? David, You’re right to be skeptical. Password managers like LastPass have themselves been compromised in a breach. It’s important to do some diligence to understand which Password Managers have the best reputations. I am also a skeptic and keep my most sensitive passwords (for banking and email) off the web completely. I, too, have had a Yahoo email account for a long time. I see above that you said people might consider switching, which I want to do. What type of email do you use personally and/or what would you recommend? Susan - I personally use Google for email and that’s the provider we use here at The New York Times too. I can’t speak to other providers, but I would encourage you to choose a provider that allows you to do things like: set a good password, turn on two-factor authentication and review active sessions and devices (this comes in useful if you need to review where your account was last accessed from, for example). Some providers have better terms of service agreements and privacy policies than others, so you may want to review those as well to better understand when/how your information is collected, stored and used. I was talking to my colleagues today about protecting data online and trying to articulate why its important.  They think I am paranoid and a conspiracy theorist.  Am I? Can governments, businesses and individuals really use your information against you? Emails, google searches, photos, etc? Priya, That is a great question. You are paranoid and these days, that’s a wonderful thing. Government hackers have routinely scoured LinkedIn and Facebook to send tailored emails to targets they want to hack. There was even one case of an oil company that state hackers could not breach head on, so they researched which restaurants employees preferred by looking at their Facebook Likes and infected the PDF take out menu of a Chinese restaurant employees ordered from. I would recommend sharing that story with any colleagues that consider you a paranoid, conspiracy theorist. It’s sure to be a wake up call.    Photo        Hackers Lurking in Vents and Soda Machines  Companies are finding that their greatest cybersecurity threats can hide in third-party systems, like networked air-conditioning equipment.   The New York Times     Companies are finding that their greatest cybersecurity threats can hide in third-party systems, like networked air-conditioning equipment. The New York Times Priya - that happens to me all the time! I find that it’s easier to argue for why it’s important if you can find a hook that helps them understand why it’s important to them. One example is use of the Signal messaging app; not everyone will care about the fact that it encrypts all calls and messages and retains little data. For some, the fact that it allows calling and messaging for free is a better selling point (and gifs, everyone loves gifs). Thanks so much for your (very thoughtful) questions, today, everyone. It’s been a pleasure. I hope we didn’t scare you off the digital universe completely! Thanks everyone! This has been great and I hope our answers were helpful. Advertisement",15692

Most of the big names — from Mercedes-Benz to Audi, BMW and Hyundai — have begun developing or forming partnerships around self-driving technology. A handful have invested sizable resources as they try to become leaders in autonomous driving.
      
      
    
 General Motors The company invested $500 million in Lyft and has announced that it would test self-driving electric taxis on public roads within a year. It bought Cruise Automation for about $1 billion, and is planning to build a development center in San Francisco. Ford The company announced a $1 billion investment in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence founded by former Google and Uber employees. Ford plans to have a fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation for a ride-hailing service by 2021. Tesla The Silicon Valley company said its cars would eventually come equipped to be fully autonomous, and has continued to update a controversial Autopilot software option (that was involved in the first fatal autonomous driving accident). Fiat Chrysler The company reached a deal with Alphabet, after having first approached Apple, to add its autonomous technology to Chrysler minivans. Alphabet now has an office in Michigan to work with Fiat Chrysler. Honda As it develops vehicle prototypes, the Japanese company is designing what it calls an “emotion engine,” which will learn from the driver’s judgments behind the wheel to make future choices and recommendations. Volvo The company started a pilot project to put autonomous SUVs in the hands of residents in Gothenburg, Sweden — a trial that could later expand to London and China. It is also working with Uber on a trial in Pittsburgh. 
While Google has managed to draw headlines, several technology companies have been looking to enter the car business, including some notable ones from China. 

 Google (Alphabet) One of the early attention-getters, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, spun off its autonomous car project into its own company called Waymo, signaling that it’s close to being commercialized. Apple The company’s ultimate ambitions remain unclear. While its once-secret effort, code-named Titan, appeared to be shrinking in 2016, it recently received a permit to test vehicles in California. Uber The company partnered with automakers to roll out prototypes in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz. It has recently been wrapped up in a legal battle with Waymo, which claimed it was using stolen intellectual property. Baidu The Chinese internet company began testing autonomous technology last year, using vehicles from three domestic automakers, with the hope of deploying cars commercially next year. Intel The company acquired Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes cameras and sensors, with the hope of becoming the go-to source for computing systems. Autoliv The world’s largest airbag supplier is in a joint venture with Volvo to develop self-driving cars. Harman International Industries Harman, which was acquired recently by Samsung, traditionally made audio systems. It has also become a supplier of components such as advanced mapping technology. nuTonomy The company, spun out from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a commercial vehicle trial in Singapore and has tested self-driving cars in the Boston area. It is also partnering with Lyft. Delphi The former G.M. parts division is developing self-driving and semi-automated technology that it hopes to sell to automakers. It has been testing autonomous cars in Singapore and is also collaborating with Mobileye and Intel. Qualcomm The company has been working on systems that allow cars to automatically communicate location information. It is acquiring NXP Semiconductors, a maker of automotive microelectronic equipment, for a deal valued at $47 billion. 
Pittsburgh became the first city in which a passenger can hail an autonomous vehicle, when Uber introduced 100 cars that can drive themselves. (Less than a year later, Pittsburgh residents and officials have said that Uber has not lived up to its end of the bargain.)
      
      
    
 
Tesla uses a computer vision-based vehicle detection system, not lidar technology, which has become popular among other companies developing autonomous functionality.  Tesla says its system is not intended to be used hands-free and parts of the system are unfinished.
      
      
    
 Forward-facing camera Image-processing software can detect lane stripes, signs, stop lights, road signs and other objects. Forward radar Reflected microwaves are used to identify the location and speed, but not always the type, of nearby vehicles. Ultrasonic sensors Reflected sound waves are used to detect distance to nearby objects. GPS Combined with high-precision mapping, GPS determines a car’s position on the road. 
After Joshua Brown, 40, was killed in May while at the wheel of a Tesla Model S, questions arose about the safety of the car’s crash-avoidance Autopilot system. The company has since released a new version. The accident may have happened in part because the crash-avoidance system was designed to engage only when radar and computer vision systems agreed that there was an obstacle, according to an industry executive with direct knowledge of the system. Some experts speculated that a lidar-driven car might have avoided the crash. But the company’s founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the upgrade could have prevented the crash.Federal auto-safety regulators later said that they found no defects in Tesla’s Autopilot system that was used during the crash.

 Here’s the state of cord-cutting in America today: It’s chaotic. Consider what’s faced by people who want to end their TV subscriptions — otherwise known as cutting the cable cord. There are now multiple different streaming services and bills to juggle. And there are numerous streaming gadgets to choose from. So to make moving away from cable cords easier, we teamed up with the Wirecutter, the product recommendations website, to compile the definitive guide to cord-cutting. The Wirecutter tested multiple services, streaming devices and antennas to come up with cord-cutter bundles for different types of people in 2016: movie buffs, sports addicts, fans of premium TV shows, binge watchers and families with children. More on the results in a minute. First, let’s explain how we got to this point. Every quarter for the last few years, hundreds of thousands of American households have put an end to their TV subscriptions, fed up with the costs of cable subscriptions, channels they never watch and the annoying commercials.  The cord-cutting movement peaked in 2011, when the cable sector bled 744,000 subscribers, according to the research firm SNL Kagan. Comcast and Time Warner responded by overhauling their cable boxes with simpler interfaces, but they managed only to diminish their losses. Last quarter, the damage count for cable was 298,000 lost subscribers. Countless other would-be customers now no longer bother to sign up in the first place. At the same time, consumers’ viewing options have widened — perhaps by too much. Streaming video services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are increasingly investing in original programs that compete with traditional television shows. At office water coolers, conversations are happening around Netflix, Hulu and Amazon originals like “Luke Cage,” “Casual” and “Transparent.” Yet cord cutters, faced with the plethora of streaming services and gadgets, remain a minority in the United States. SNL Kagan estimates that by last quarter, just 12 percent of American households subscribed to broadband internet services without a traditional TV package. That’s where this definitive guide comes in. What we found was there is no one-size-fits-all solution because each streaming service carries a different catalog of content, and each gadget has access to different services.  The upshot: While Roku’s $50 streaming stick and Netflix are great for many purposes, you may want to use different devices or services depending on what you watch. For movie buffs, there are plenty of cord-cutting options that will make any transition painless. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu all have large film libraries for streaming — Amazon’s alone holds 18,400 titles, though the selection regularly changes because of agreements with content providers.  Netflix’s library has shrunk over time, as the company is no longer trying to offer the glut of back-catalog movies that every service seems to have. But Netflix has tried to compensate by focusing on movies it has exclusive licenses to, including those from Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm.  Amazon focuses more on quantity, but without those exclusive titles the other services offer. For recent releases, Amazon, iTunes, the Google Play store and Vudu usually get digital versions of recent movies that can be purchased for $15 to $20, or rented for about $5, even before they’re available on disc.  For most people, Netflix will offer the best selection of new movies and original programming — and Google, Amazon or Apple will offer the best selection for rentals or purchases. BEST SERVICE: Netflix plus à la carte rentals/purchases ($8 to $12/month)   BEST HARDWARE: Roku Streaming Stick ($50)  MOST AFFORDABLE: Roku Streaming Stick  ALSO WORKS WITH: Apple TV ($149), other Roku models    For those who love watching sports, a subscription to either PlayStation Vue or Sling TV gets you ESPN and Fox Sports 1, depending on your package. And each system offers additional sports channels, depending on your interests.  You may also want to watch over-the-air broadcast channels, especially for N.F.L. games. Most televisions have an over-the-air tuner built-in, so you will be able to get your local major networks (ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC) using your existing TV hardware and an inexpensive antenna, such as the Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse ($40).   BEST SERVICE: PlayStation Vue ($30 to $45/month)  BEST HARDWARE: FireTV ($40 to $100) or Google Chromecast ($35)  MOST AFFORDABLE: Google Chromecast  ALSO WORKS WITH: Apple TV ($149), Roku ($50)    No problem. HBO, Showtime and Starz can all be viewed on a phone, tablet or streaming device with a direct subscription — no cable or satellite subscription or long-term contract required. You will get access to each network’s original programming, as well as the movies each is currently showing, and you can watch from anywhere.  BEST HARDWARE:  Roku Streaming Stick ($50)  MOST AFFORDABLE: Roku Streaming Stick or Google Chromecast ($35)  ALSO WORKS WITH: Apple TV ($149), other Roku models  Netflix and Amazon Instant Video are your best bets to binge-watch television shows. Each offers award-winning original content, including “House of Cards,” “Orange Is the New Black,” “Master of None,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Making a Murderer” on Netflix; and on Amazon, “Transparent,” “Mozart in the Jungle” and “The Man in the High Castle.”  For this original content, all episodes are released online at once. Each service also carries recent TV series, including “Better Call Saul” and “Mr. Robot,” shortly after the DVD release date.   If you don’t want to wait, you can usually purchase a “season pass” for current TV shows through iTunes, Amazon or Google Play at a cost of $20 to $30 per season usually. Google Play is generally the least expensive, offering savings of around 15 to 25 percent — and watch new episodes the day they’re aired on TV.   Hulu Plus focuses on current TV seasons, letting you watch them right after they air instead of when the season has ended. But it lacks many current popular shows.  BEST SERVICE: Netflix ($8 to $12/month) or Amazon ($99/year), or à la carte seasons  BEST HARDWARE: Roku Streaming Stick ($50)  MOST AFFORDABLE: Roku Streaming Stick  ALSO WORKS WITH: Fire TV ($40 to $100), other Roku Models, Apple TV ($149 — Google and Amazon require an iOS or macOS device)  Netflix offers a wide selection of content, both educational and entertaining, along with original children’s programming like the recent “Voltron” reboot. It also offers the option to create a children’s profile that lets you limit viewing to particular ratings or age levels. In addition, Netflix has a new partnership with Disney that will make more Disney films available for streaming.  PBS Kids Now lets you stream recent episodes of PBS shows, and the selection is updated every week with the latest episodes of most shows. Amazon Instant Video also has children’s content and its own custom children’s programming, as well as FreeTime Unlimited, a selection of curated shows, apps and games for children for a monthly fee ($3 for Amazon Prime members, $5 for nonmembers). However, FreeTime Unlimited is available only on Amazon’s own hardware.   Sling TV also offers a children’s package for those who want to stream Nick Jr., Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Cartoon Network and more.   BEST SERVICE: Netflix ($8 to $12/month)  BEST HARDWARE: Roku Streaming Stick ($50)  MOST AFFORDABLE: Roku Streaming Stick (except for FreeTime Unlimited), Amazon Fire TV ($40 to $100)  ALSO WORKS WITH: Apple TV ($149), other Roku models  There are still downsides to cord-cutting. J.D. Power & Associates, a research firm that collects feedback on brands and products from consumers, said customer satisfaction scores were highest among “cord stackers” — people with traditional TV packages who also subscribed to online video services. What made cord cutters less satisfied were two factors: customer care and value, according to J.D. Power.  For customer care, cord cutters may run into problems more often than traditional TV subscribers, said Kirk Parsons, a senior director of telecommunications research at J.D. Power. The streaming content provider may be experiencing issues. For example, this month, Netflix suffered a failure after the release of the new show “Luke Cage.” Your Wi-Fi connection might be spotty, or your internet provider may be experiencing issues. It’s tough to tell.  For value, cutting the cord isn’t very cheap if you then subscribe to multiple services to gain access to a diverse set of content. For cable subscribers, paying one bill is less of a hassle than juggling multiple bills. And even after you subscribe to multiple streaming services, there is still some content that you may miss out on because it is available only via cable or satellite, like some TV shows or live sports events.  “I would love to have the ability to pick and choose what I want as opposed to having four different services,” Mr. Parsons said. “I think we’ll get there, but right now it’s frustrating for consumers to get what they want.”  Sign up for the Watching newsletter to get twice-weekly recommendations of what to stream straight to your inbox.

      By THE NEW YORK TIMES

UPDATED March 15, 2017
 
 Yahoo has said that hackers in 2013 stole data of over one billion users. Names, contact information, passwords and answers to security questions may have been taken in the breach, the company said. The next year, according to the company, a similar attack affected 500 million accounts. Whether you are a current or former Yahoo user, security experts have said that incidents like these could have far-reaching consequences for users beyond Yahoo’s services.  Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about how you can protect yourself. Assume it was.  Yahoo said it had begun notifying potentially affected users, but its breach was huge, and similar attacks and smaller thefts happen all the time.  The first step, as always, is to change passwords for sites that contain sensitive information like financial, health or credit card data. Do not use the same password across multiple sites.  Changing Yahoo passwords will be just the start for many of you. Comb through other services — especially those for which you provided a Yahoo email address to create an account — to make sure passwords used on those sites aren’t too similar to what you were using on Yahoo.  And if you weren’t doing so already, you’ll have to treat everything you receive online with an abundance of suspicion, in case hackers are trying to trick you out of even more information.  Try a password manager like 1Password or LastPass.  These sites create a unique password for each website you visit and store them in a database protected by a master password that you create. Password managers reduce the risk of reused passwords or those that are easy to decode.  The Wirecutter, a product recommendations site now owned by The New York Times, provides a helpful explanation of why password managers are so essential. They also maintain an updated guide to the best password managers. If you must create your own passwords, try creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases or one-sentence summaries of strange life events and add numbers and special characters.  Examples: Or, if you’re extra paranoid, consider mimicking this setup:  Jeremiah Grossman, a web security expert, memorizes only a few passwords, including one to unlock his computer, and another to unlock an encrypted USB drive containing a file with a list of all his passwords for dozens of services. None of his passwords are memorable because they are random.  “I select them quite literally by banging on the keyboard a few times like a monkey,” Mr. Grossman said, adding that his setup is “a bit more paranoid” than that of the average person. Create the strongest passwords for the sites that contain the most sensitive information and do not reuse them anywhere.  Passwords are not enough. If a site offers additional security features, like secondary or two-factor authentication, enable them. Then, when you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text) with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in. Many bank sites and major sites like Google and Apple offer two-factor authentication. In some cases, the second authentication is required only if you are logging in from a new computer. Increasingly, you cannot. Regularly monitoring your financial records can help minimize the damage if someone gets your information. But only the companies storing your personal data are responsible for securing it. Consumers can slow down hackers and identity thieves, but corporate computer security and law enforcement are the biggest deterrents. The Yahoo attack happened three years ago but was disclosed only this week. Even if you changed your passwords recently for other websites, chances are at least some of them are similar to the password linked to your Yahoo account.  To play it safe, you should change your passwords, starting with your most sensitive accounts, including your online banking account.  Sites will often use security questions like “What was the name of your first school?” or “What is your mother’s maiden name?” to recover a user’s account if the password is forgotten.  These questions are problematic because the internet has made public record searches simple and the answers are usually easy to guess.  In a recent study, security researchers at Google found that with a single guess, an attacker would have a 19.7 percent chance of duplicating an English-speaking user’s answer to the question, “What is your favorite food?” (It was pizza.)  With 10 tries, an attacker would have a 39 percent chance of guessing a Korean-speaking user’s answer to the question, “What is your city of birth?” and a 43 percent chance of guessing the favorite food.  Jonathan Zdziarski, a computer forensics expert, said he often answered these questions with an alternate password. If a site offers only multiple choice answers, or requires only short passwords, he will not use it.  “You can tell a lot about the security of a site just by looking at the questions they’ll ask you,” he said.

The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up. On Tuesday, Verizon officially acquired the company for a fraction of what it was worth in 2000. The business will be formally combined with Verizon’s AOL unit, with many expected to lose their jobs.

Yahoo’s value lies in its billion monthly users, more than any site other than Google and Facebook. But over the last decade it has lost advertising revenue and search traffic to those same companies. By combining Yahoo with its AOL unit, Verizon hopes to create a stronger competitor.

Yahoo’s revenue has been sluggish for years. Marissa Mayer, hired as chief executive in 2012, managed to post some growth in hot categories like mobile and video advertising, but that did not offset weakness in the display and search ads that are the company’s bread and butter. With the completion of the Verizon merger, Ms. Mayer resigned from her position.

Although investors place little value on Yahoo’s business, the company owns 15 percent of Alibaba, worth about $48 billion. Investors pressured Yahoo to find a way to separate the Alibaba stake from the rest of Yahoo. The Verizon deal does that, leaving Yahoo shareholders with an investment company that holds the Alibaba stock and shares in Yahoo Japan.

 The technology shift in payments is gaining momentum. In the last two years, Apple, Samsung Electronics and Google have released mobile wallets. To combat fraud, merchants have also been moving away from accepting credit card payments with the magnetic stripe and instead are requiring chip cards. We decided to test how well these new technologies work. We found that mobile wallets were more convenient than chip cards. While all the mobile wallets generally work the same, they each have pros and cons. Here is a rundown of how the mobile wallets compare and where they are accepted. Who accepts it: 90 percent of the top 250 retailers, including Walgreens, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. Banks that support it: About 130 banks and credit unions, including Bank of America, Citi, Chase, U.S. Bank, American Express and Wells Fargo. Compatible devices: Samsung’s Galaxy Note 5, S6 and S7 devices. How it works: Add your credit card to the Samsung Pay app. To pay, swipe up on the screen, hold your phone to the terminal and scan your fingerprint or enter a PIN. Who accepts it: 2.5 million United States locations. Retailers include Walgreens, Dunkin’ Donuts, BevMo, Best Buy, Bloomingdale’s and Crate and Barrel.   Banks that support it: More than 2,500 banks in the United States, including Wells Fargo, Chase, American Express and Bank of America; banks in Britain, Singapore, mainland China and Australia.   Compatible devices: iPhone 6, 6S and SE devices; Apple Watch.  How it works: Add your credit card to the Wallet app on iPhone. Hold your iPhone or Apple Watch up to the terminal. On iPhone, register your fingerprint to make a payment; on Apple Watch, enter your passcode.  Who accepts it: About 64 retailers, including Chevron, McDonald’s, Jamba Juice, Bloomingdale’s and American Eagle. Banks that support it: 48 banks in the United States, including Wells Fargo, Citi, Discover, U.S. Bank, American Express and Bank of America. Compatible devices: Any Android phone that includes Google’s Play services and near-field communications. How it works: Download the Android Pay app from Google’s Play Store and set up the wallet with your credit card. Tap the phone on the terminal to pay. Advertisement",2268

By Seth Kugel Chaotically refined, verdantly concrete, intimately gargantuan: The most populous metropolis in South America was but a middling coffee city until the mid-20th century, when an influx of northeastern migrants set off a growth spurt that shows no sign of stopping. With seemingly infinite skyscrapers nearly blocking out the sun (when its famously overcast skies don’t do it first), visitors don’t always take to the city instantly. But its treasures lie below the surface: world-class restaurants, Brazil-class music and an ever-ebullient arts scene, from alternative theaters to sparkling new museums. And though Paulistanos are often stereotyped as harried and overworked, that’s only compared to other Brazilians; compared to most megacity dwellers they are downright easygoing. Meanwhile, there’s ever more to see, as the slow-cooker of progress — or is it gentrification? — regenerates the once-abandoned historic center, block by block. But downtown is still no hipster paradise. It’s as vibrant and culturally alive as it is gritty and pickpockety, enough so that many wealthy residents stick to greener, wealthier areas. Visitors, of course, can take in the best of both. Friday afternoon is the perfect time to explore the old center, when it is still humming with office workers streaming in and out of modest shops and restaurants. Plot out your destinations on a paper map beforehand, as cellphone-gazers attract skilled pickpockets. But then stop worrying. Wander from the free galleries of Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil to the Monastery of São Bento, and then find espresso and Portuguese pastry at ultratraditional Casa Mathilde. Head into the Sesc 24 de Maio, a brand new, ballyhooed, mostly public high-rise cultural center whose highlights include an art gallery and top-floor cafe. (For members, it’s the rooftop pool.) For bargain shopping, take a cab or Uber over to Rua José Paulino in Bom Retiro, where Brazilian confecções — clothing (not candy) manufacturers — run true factory outlets, selling wares that would otherwise find their way, with jacked-up prices, to stores around the country.  If cooking is an art form, then the mind-bending dishes that Jefferson Rueda coaxes from pig parts is a porcine symphony. A Casa do Porco (The House of Pig) Bar may be the least kosher, least halal restaurant in Brazil, but just about everyone else loves it. The pig de resistance is torresmo com goiabada, an appetizer that is less hors d’oeuvre than chef d’oeuvre: Cubes of luscious pork crackling attached to tender meat by a layer of fat are topped with a squiggle of guava paste. It’s appetizer, dessert and dietary sin all in one: dry and sweet and creamy. The affordable tasting menu (around 100 reais, or about $31) is a no-brainer, and a thoughtful new vegetarian version mimics the porky one. No reservations accepted, which is why you’re getting there at 6 p.m.: Otherwise you might spend your evening waiting for a table.  For overlapping periods of the early 20th century, the ornate palacete (little palace) downtown at the corner of Rua Direita and Rua Quintina Bocaiuva housed a beloved musical instrument store, the Record radio network and Irmãos Vitale, a renowned music publisher. The cobblestone intersection became known as Music Corner, but the musical tradition died about when downtown did. That changed in 2017, when Casa de Francisca moved from the genteel Jardim Paulista neighborhood to the second floor, bringing a cultural jolt to a still rough and tumble area. Reserve a table for an eclectic lineup of Brazilian bands, which play on a circular stage in a teal-green space that recalls Old Havana. The classiness extends to the bar and kitchen — cocktail sensibilities came to São Paulo late, but you wouldn’t know it from the top-notch old-fashioned (35 reais).  You can’t really claim to have visited São Paulo if you haven’t treated yourself to a pastel de feira, rectangular dough pockets with your choice of a near infinite varieties of fillings — escarole, chicken and catupiry cheese, “pizza” — rapid-fried on the spot at stands that anchor just about every farmer’s market in the city. Doesn’t sound like breakfast? Don’t tell that to those packing the tables, downing them with a pico de gallo-like “vinagrete” in between gulps of just-pressed sugar cane juice laced with pineapple or ginger. One of the best Saturday morning markets is on Rua Mourato Coelho in Vila Madalena, a hippie-turned-hipster-turned-upscale neighborhood. Post-pastel, wander the stalls, admiring the spices and cheeses and angling for samples of mango, papaya and, if it’s in season, the must-try jabuticaba. For one of the cheapest upscale lunches you’ll ever have, head to the Pintar Materiais Artísticos, an art supply store (you read that right) in the Pompeia neighborhood. In an awkward L-shaped space shoehorned into the shop is Petí Gastronomia, with ever-changing prix fixe menus of “democratized” contemporary cuisine from the lauded chef Victor Dimitrow. But Petí’s real hero may be its accountant: Just 47.50 reais will get you three courses of, say, octopus carpaccio, pork rib with mole poblano, and “cacao four ways” for dessert. Creative drinks come with poems handwritten on their coasters, courtesy of the wait staff. If there’s a line, browse the shelves of art books by or about Latin American artists.  São Paulo’s world-renowned street art is everywhere, but most visitors just head to Batman Alley, a traffic-free tangle of passages covered in wildly creative works and surrounded by upscale cafes and galleries in Vila Madalena. A tour with the guide Renato Goes takes you there first, and then to the Outdoor Museum of Urban Art — where works are spray-painted onto the pylons under an elevated subway line — and downtown, where creations cover entire sides of buildings. Don’t be surprised if there’s a detour: Mr. Goes follows São Paulo’s best on Instagram, so you never know when you’ll stop on the side of the highway to admire work done the night before. Booked through Around SP, a three-hour tour is 490 reais and up.  When northeastern migrants came to São Paulo last century, they brought their down-home cooking with them: dried meats, a rice and beans dish called baião a dois and tapioca in countless forms. You can find all three at the unpretentiously stylish Fitó, which serves food inspired by the cuisine of Piauí state. Especially worth your stomach real estate is the paçoca, a mix of manioc flour with shredded carne de sol (beef cured for three days, though no longer in the sun as its name implies). A meal for two with drinks will run you around 100 reais. Brazil’s Arab roots run deep — two of São Paulo’s last three mayors are of Lebanese descent — but most families arrived generations ago. Al Janiah is a rare nightspot and restaurant staffed by recent immigrants, largely Syrian refugees. The owner, Hasan Zarif, a native Brazilian born to Palestinian refugee parents, meant the place to be a bar and restaurant but it has morphed into a community center as well, with book launches and Arabic classes. Weekends, though, are all about night life, with live bands and a distinctly underground student vibe. And hummus, incredible hummus. The Palestina Libre cocktail (25 reais) is a delicious mix of anise-flavored arak, zaatar, mild biquino peppers, lime, mint and cachaça. If the cocktail’s (or the bar’s) politics bother you, well, as a sign on the wall reads, “A vida transtorna” — life unsettles, life perplexes, life agitates.  Avoid newfangled brunch spots, and have an authentic Sunday morning meal at a padoca, slang for bakery. But a padoca is hardly just a bakery — it’s a full-service restaurant that is also part diner and part deli; every neighborhood has one, just ask around. For the truly local experience, order pão na chapa, buttered and grilled halves of the buns Brazilians call French bread, with a pingado — strong coffee with a little milk — and maybe an astonishingly cheap fresh-squeezed orange juice. There’s no shame in taking a dive into the pastries behind the counter (not literally, though you’ll be tempted) or ordering an omelet. Just don’t call it brunch.  On Sundays, Paulista Avenue is closed to traffic and taken over by pedestrians and cyclists. You could entertain yourself wandering from political demonstration to street performer to craft vendor to Beatles cover band, but even better is to culture hop among the institutions lining the city’s main drag. There’s the brutalist Museu de Arte de São Paulo and the shiny new Japan House, but the highlight these days is IMS Paulista, a new branch of the Instituto Moreira Salles, where wide-ranging, innovative exhibitions appeal equally to art aficionados and those who just like looking at pictures.  With São Paulo’s limited subway system and clogged highways, nothing is more important than location. Avoid straying too far from Paulista Avenue, where you’ll find plenty of choices. Those seeking an upscale experience will be happy in the leather-upholstered luxury of the Fasano São Paulo, where doubles start around 1,700 reais. Pousadas, or inns, are usually found in smaller towns, but Pousada Ziláh has six rooms in a 1932 house that aches with understated charm, a mere 10-minute walk from the bustle (and subway) of Paulista Avenue. Five of the six have outdoor balconies or terraces, and start at 345 reais. To be closer to the downtown excitement, a good budget choice is 155 Hotel near skateboarder-filled, alternative theater-bordered Praça Roosevelt. Doubles start at 150 reais. Advertisement",9763

After creative types moved into the area, trendy restaurants, galleries, distilleries and other business have followed. By Shivani Vora There’s a spark of energy that shows no sign of slowing down in Nashville’s Wedgewood- Houston neighborhood. Situated a few blocks south of the city’s downtown, the area was long a run-down part of town with warehouses, factories and garages. Today, artists, musicians and other creative types are moving into shiny modern condominiums and homes. Just as local real estate developers have been attracted by the inexpensive land and prime location, entrepreneurs have been lured in for these same reasons, too, and are opening restaurants, distilleries, art galleries and other businesses that draw crowds from all over town.  Once a jam factory, now a bar and restaurant: the front area of this airy, two-year-old space is home to a bar cum lounge with mismatched couches and chairs with deep cushions. The cocktails are innovative, the spirit list is long, and an oversize plate of decadent nachos is the sole dining option. Hidden behind a sliding, metal door, however, is an intimate 24-seat restaurant where diners choose from a grid style menu to design their dream five-course dinner; entrees change weekly but emphasize local ingredients in eclectic New American dishes. One of the city's pricier restaurants, a meal is a splurge but delicious and the vibe is worth it. Alcoholic drinks at the bar start at $12, a dinner for two with a glass of wine each is about $180. 434 Houston Street, bastionnashville.com Housed in a former truck repair shop, this spacious bakery opened three years ago and is always jammed with locals who come to treat themselves to the brown sugar and cornmeal cherry scones, pecan bars and lemon madeleines.

There’s also a cafe area where lunch and weekend brunch are served. Baked goods start at $3. 516 Hagan Street, dozen-nashville.com Big bucks aren’t necessary to buy a piece of high-caliber contemporary American art: that’s the premise of this light flooded art gallery with soaring wood ceilings, which the seasoned art gallerist David Lusk opened in a former truck mechanic business in 2014. In fact, it was this venue from the Memphis-based gallerist that helped generate interest in the neighborhood. Mr. Lusk’s collection includes paintings, photographs and sculptures, and he takes pride in having a close relationship with the close to three dozen artists he sells. Several Nashville natives are part of the mix, including Kit Reuther, who is known for her abstract paintings and sculptures in muted tones.

By Shivani Vora A visit to the Eternal City with all the bells and whistles doesn’t have to put a big dent in your wallet, says Simone Amorico, a native Roman and a co-owner of Access Italy, a company that sells luxury trips to Italy.  “If you know where to stay, dine and shop and when to visit, you can come to Rome and have an affordable luxury trip,” he said. Here are some of his best tips to do just that.  January through March and November and December (the week before Christmas is the exception) are the best times to visit Rome, especially if you’re looking for a break on lodging. High-end travelers can get between 30 and 50 percent off usual rates at five-star hotels. This also when hotels offer special promotions, like a third night free or a spa treatment and daily breakfast included with your stay.  Mr. Amorico advised travelers in the United States to consider a trip during Thanksgiving week. “While Americans may have time off, Italians don’t celebrate the holiday, and it’s considered low season which means hotel prices are low,” he said.  For those who can’t travel to Rome during off-peak season, Mr. Amorico said that it’s best to stay in hotels in less touristy but still located in well-situated neighborhoods such as Monti, Testaccio and Parioli. The properties in these areas have nightly rates at least 20 percent lower than ones in touristy spots. Or, consider renting a luxury apartment, which can be between 30 and 50 percent less expensive than a luxury hotel. Sites like Access Italy and OneFineStay offer a portfolio of Rome apartment rentals. Stay away from the overpriced, average restaurants situated in Piazza Navona, Pantheon and Campo dei Fiori, Rome’s main squares. You’ll enjoy less expensive and tastier meals and also get more of a local flavor of the city by dining at spots in Monti, especially on Via Urbani, where there are some excellent trattorias. Other areas worth visiting for great local restaurants include Via del Corallo, Piazza del Fico, Via Giulia and Via del Governo Vecchio. When it comes to lunch, Mr. Amorico suggested enjoying a thin-crust pizza (around $10) at a pizzeria or going to a trattoria for a bowl of pasta (around $12) such as his favorite, cacio e pepe. This strategy allows you to save your money for a nice dinner or two with wine in some of Rome’s terrific seafood and fine dining spots. His top recommendations are Assunta Madre for seafood and Ristorante Tullio for classic Italian dishes like cannelloni and Roman-style artichokes.  A private guide is a pricey indulgence and worthwhile mainly if you’re interested in learning more about a particular topic, like historic architecture or art. But if you plan to hire one, do it during a weekday. During the week, guides in Rome cost usually around 20 percent less compared with weekends (and during low season, they can be up to 40 percent less).  If you’re in the city between May and October and want to hire a guide to see the Vatican Museum, do it on a Friday night, when the museum is open late. “A guide will charge a lower price on these Friday nights than during the day because it’s a lot cooler and less crowded,” Mr. Amorico said.  Rome’s many designer stores, including big-name luxury brands you may be familiar with, usually have sales twice a year, Mr. Amorico said. Winter collections get discounted in early January while summer collections get reduced in early July. The sales last between four and six weeks.  But Mr. Amorico also suggested checking out the fashionable and well-priced clothes, shoes and handbags from lesser-known designers for great looks on a budget. They’re usually sold in independently-owned boutiques in Monti, Trastevere, Parioli and Fleming.  Finally, regardless of your budget, the best way to see Rome is by walking. Don’t bother spending your money on a car and driver or taxis, Mr. Amorico said. “Rome is like an open-air museum, and the only way to experience it is on foot,” he said.  Advertisement",4181

But it can be done (plenty of delicious dumplings helped).  By Lucas Peterson Superlatives are everywhere in Shanghai. I forked over my 50 yuan (about $7.90) and boarded the maglev train departing from Pudong International Airport. My understanding was that this was a high-speed train, like the one I’d recently taken from Chengdu to Xian. I didn’t realize that, operating by a giant set of magnets that caused it to levitate over the track (hence the name, maglev), it was the fastest commercially operating train in the world. After leaving precisely on time, our speed began to build. And build. Soon, we were screaming through a blur of new housing developments and farmland at 268 miles per hour as we made our way from the Pacific coast to the heart of Shanghai. The ride, while not exactly smooth — you feel the speed — was exhilarating. I stepped off 19 miles and a few minutes later at Longyang Road, slightly dazed. Despite this high-tech arrival system, Shanghai is, in a way, a late bloomer. Cities like Beijing and Xian have been political and commercial powerhouses for centuries. Heading into the 19th century, Shanghai was a modest trading port that exploded after being “opened” to the world by Western imperialism. What became known as the Paris of the East laid the groundwork for what Shanghai is today: an unparalleled economic powerhouse and megacity of 24 million people. Packed with luxury brands and overrun with shiny Bentleys and Audis, it’s also impossibly expensive — kryptonite for a penny-pincher like me. Luckily, I was able to spend a four-day weekend there denting, but not breaking, the bank. You can start saving money by staying on the fringes of the city center, where rooms at the Peninsula can run $900 per night. I settled on the Jinjiang Metropolo Hotel Classiq Shanghai, just north of the Huangpu River in Hongkou, and paid 576 yuan per night, about $90, for a perfectly comfortable “Extreme Sassy” double room. (The hotel has since been rebranded as the Golden Tulip Bund New Asia. Things move fast in Shanghai.)  After the rush of the maglev train, getting there on the subway felt like a mere crawl. Still, it was relatively efficient and definitely cheap — expect to pay between 3 and 5 yuan for a one-way journey. And the location near Tiantong Road was ideal — I could either hop directly on the subway or take a short walk over the Suzhou River into the Huangpu District, giving me easy access to the Number 2 subway line, one of the two main underground east-west thoroughfares in the city. It’s also just a few minutes’ walk to the Bund, the famous waterfront area where old European banking and trading houses gaze over the river at the new, towering financial centers of Pudong. China is platitudinously described as a compelling mix of ancient and modern — but in Shanghai, there’s ample reason. Walking in Shanghai, though, can be an adventure. As you might expect from a city of more than 20 million people, it’s constant and not-always-controlled chaos. Still, between the nonstop dodging of cars and motorbikes, it’s fairly doable — and a great way to work up an appetite. And while Shanghai itself is high-priced (a cold brew and pizza slice at the world’s largest Starbucks will set you back $20), true Shanghainese cuisine happens to favor the frugal, in the form of one of my favorite types of food: dumplings. The first dumpling to get to know is the xiao long bao, or soup dumpling, a regional specialty that’s long been popular in the States. The steamed dumplings, usually filled with pork or crab meat, have delicate, nearly translucent skins — but not too thin that they might break, losing the valuable liquid inside. My first of many great xiao long bao came from Papa Chan’s Shanghai Dumplings, a fairly sizable restaurant on Sichuan Middle Road. Around late morning, I noticed a mob of people forming in the lobby and decided to join them. I was glad I did — while I ended up mistakenly getting four orders of dumplings (10 yuan each) instead of one order of four dumplings (my Chinese is a little rusty), they were perfectly petite and bite-size, and exploding with porky soup flavor. I’d snarfed down a dozen before I’d even gotten wind of the sizzling jian bao — a thicker, doughier fried dumpling — down the street.  At Lao Sheng Xing, another quick casual midday hot spot, a man wielding two pairs of industrial pliers poured a steady stream of grease out of a wide, shallow pan. The two dozen or so golden brown dumplings, stuffed with beef and chopped vegetables, bubbled and sputtered. I ordered three big fried dumplings, each about the size of a baseball, for a total of 9 yuan. The drill at most of these places is the same: Order at the counter and hand your receipt to a server or, in this case, the guy making the dumplings. Grab your food, an available seat and enjoy. Other quality dumpling houses abound, and special mention should go to Ling Long Fang for its casual, appealingly dingy atmosphere and excellent xiao long bao (16 yuan a dozen) — which you can see being made while you wait. The real M.V.P. of Shanghai dumplings, though, is the sheng jian bao. At the intersection of steamed bun, fried pot sticker and soup dumpling, you’ll find the sheng jian bao (not to be confused with the regular jian bao mentioned above). They are fried in a shallow pan, then steamed, and finished off with a smattering of scallions and sesame seeds. They also drench the palate with hot juice upon the initial bite. You can get your fix at Da Hu Chun, a warm and homey storefront with shared tables and four pork-filled dumplings for 7 yuan. Of nearly as good quality are the ones at Yang’s Dumplings, a popular chain — get the sheng jian bao stuffed with shrimp (four for 18 yuan). The best I had, though, were during a two-hour morning food tour I purchased through Lost Plate, a food tour outfitter (300 yuan, includes food). Our guide, Nick, started us off at Xiahai Miao (Under the Sea), a Buddhist temple with an adjacent vegetarian restaurant (the Eight Treasure Noodles were quite good), then walked us through the former Jewish Ghetto, where 20,000 refugees lived during World War II. Winding our way through the nongtang (old-fashioned alleyways) passing humble apartment blocks with European-style balconies, we ended up near the intersection of Dongyuhang and Anguo Roads, where I found the sheng jian bao of my dreams in a small storefront. They were fluffy on top, crunchy on the bottom and filled with savory, fatty juice. They were included in the price of the tour, but would have cost just 6 yuan for an order of four.  While I was beguiled by the food of Shanghai (as you might be able to tell), I was equally smitten with the numerous historical, artistic and musical options the city has to offer. After the tour ended, I went to the nearby Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum (20 yuan), which elucidates the history of Jewish refugees in Shanghai, highlighting in particular the lives of Jakob Rosenfeld, an Austrian doctor who fought with the People’s Liberation Army, and Ho Feng Shan, a diplomat sometimes called the Chinese Schindler for issuing visas against orders. Elsewhere, the M50 Art Industry Park is a huge arts community set in a prewar textile manufacturing complex. Most of the dozens upon dozens of galleries are free to browse — including the Chenglin Art Gallery, home to the playful and colorful paintings of Chenglin Huang — though a handful charge admission. I also stopped in at the gallery of Bu Bai Liao, who happily showed me several of his rock ‘n’ roll-inspired portraits. Mr. Bu said he enjoyed M50, but added that communal gallery life has a downside: “I think artists need the freedom to communicate with other people.” One of the most entertaining galleries is island6, home of the Shanghai-based art collective Liu Dao. It draws heavily from technology in its pieces, with plenty of video game references and an inevitable tongue-in-cheek critique of capitalism. A work called “Cheongsam Kingdom” featured a painting of a classic automobile superimposed over a looped video of a young woman in traditional dress behind the wheel, blowing LED smoke through a cigarette. The M97 Gallery on Changping Road is smaller, more intimate and free — and is easy to miss if you’re not looking for it. I was interested by a macabre, slightly disturbing multimedia installation called “The Theater of Apparitions,” by Roger Ballen, as well as work that involved the beautiful layering of Chinese calligraphy and traditional darkroom techniques by Sun Yanchu.  Another worthwhile art destination — in the southeast corner of the city center and marginally harder to get to — is the state-run Power Station of Art, formerly the Nanshi Power Plant. Admission is free, but I paid an additional 50 yuan to see the special exhibition dedicated to the Italian design collective Superstudio (through March 11). The concept of a government-supervised contemporary art museum is intriguing, to say the least, and it’s interesting to see how Chinese artists navigate the boundaries of harsh censorship. The music in Shanghai is as compelling as its art, and I saw a number of live music shows over the course of my stay. Jazz is one popular import, and I headed out one night to watch the smoking-hot Ulysses Owens Jr. Quartet at Jazz at Lincoln Center Shanghai — yes, that Lincoln Center. The club was swank and intimate, and the music as good as any you’ll see in New York City. A highlight was the vocalist Alicia Olatuja joining for a sultry rendition of Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature.” Tickets (180 yuan) were reasonable, though the servers didn’t care much for the fact that I passed on ordering dinner and had only a Qingdao beer (55 yuan).  On a different end of the spectrum was a Leonard Bernstein retrospective I attended at the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1879 as the Shanghai Public Band and billed as Asia’s oldest orchestra. The conductor, Zhang Jiemin, exhibited masterful control, and she led the orchestra through a program that included the overture to “Candide” (one of my favorites), as well as Bernstein’s “Jeremiah” symphony. The 80-yuan tickets were sold out when I went to the box office, so I took the next best at 180 yuan. (Upon arriving at the symphony hall, for what it’s worth, I noticed plenty of scalpers looking to unload tickets.) On my last day, I indulged a touristic whim and headed to the observation deck at the top of the Shanghai Tower (180 yuan). There are a number of interesting things about the building itself — an innovative rain-collecting system reduces water consumption by 25 percent, for example — which helped make up for the hazy, less-than-stellar view at the top. At 2,073 feet tall, it’s the second-tallest building in the world, behind the Burj Khalifa.  As if sensing impending disappointment, our elevator operator proudly pointed out that the elevator we were riding, at 45 m.p.h., was in fact the fastest in the world. In Shanghai, the competitive fire always burns. Lucas Peterson is the Frugal Traveler columnist. He has written for GQ, Lucky Peach, Eater, LA Weekly and Food Republic.

By Stephanie Rosenbloom Moving through the airport is becoming increasingly high-tech and, for many frequent fliers, faster. The percentage of air travelers who used automated methods (like Global Entry kiosks) during the international arrivals process soared to more than 50 percent in fiscal year 2017, up from about 3 percent in fiscal year 2013, according to United States Customs and Border Protection. And that number is expected to rise.  In February, the Transportation Security Administration expanded its expedited screening program, T.S.A. PreCheck, to Air France, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Philippine Airlines and World Atlantic, bringing the number of airlines participating in the program to close to 50 across some 200 airports. The Global Entry program — where members scan their fingerprints and passports at kiosks instead of waiting in immigration lines — is also growing, and making it easier to join with enrollment at 11 international airports in November (including Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Denver International Airport), with more to come.  Yet Customs and Border Protection has increasingly been pushing beyond fingerprint biometrics, testing facial recognition exit technology (not without concerns from privacy rights groups) last year at eight United States airports, including Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport and Miami International Airport. Facial recognition technology is also being tested during the boarding process at certain airports like Hartsfield-Jackson, Kennedy and Boston Logan International Airport. Delta, for instance, began allowing travelers to use their fingerprints rather than a boarding pass at Reagan Washington National Airport. The carrier subsequently began allowing travelers to check their luggage using their fingerprints as identification as well.  The most effective airport timesavers, like Global Entry, require background checks and fees. Yet in the last year or so a free program that expedites the immigration process has become more popular, even with members of Global Entry.  To join Global Entry you must complete a comprehensive online form about your travel history, have an in-person interview with a customs official, be fingerprinted, and pay a $100 application fee (good for five years). It’s the most seamless way to move through customs: You simply stop at an automated passport control kiosk, identify yourself with your passport and finger biometrics, and tap a screen to answer a few questions. (Note: Global Entry is not strictly for United States citizens, nationals and lawful permanent residents; passport holders from Argentina, Colombia, Germany, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and Britain may also apply.) But a number of travelers (Americans and Canadian visitors) have been discovering a free program called Mobile Passport Control — the use of which has increased threefold from fiscal year 2016 to 2017.  While not necessarily as quick as Global Entry, Mobile Passport Control still saves users the time and hassle of filling out a paper declaration form. And it doesn’t require any sort of advance approval or interview. Rather, it works through a free Customs and Border Protection app for iOS and Android called Mobile Passport and can be used at about 25 airports (in cities that include New York, Houston and Chicago), as well as at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.  To use the Mobile Passport app, users create a profile by adding their passport information (along with the passport information for each family member traveling with them). Then, when their flight lands at a participating airport, they follow signs to a designated fast Mobile Passport Control lane, open the app and answer five questions about their trip (on behalf of their entire family), submit it, and then receive a receipt with an encrypted bar code. When they reach the Customs and Border Protection officer in their lane, they show their passport, scan the bar code on the receipt, and go on their way.  While the Mobile Passport app is not as comprehensive or ubiquitous as Global Entry (Global Entry is at more than 50 airports, while Mobile Passport is at fewer than half that), Customs and Border Protection says they are complementary programs. As veteran Global Entry members know, at certain times of the day and at particular airports there can be a line for the kiosks. Or a kiosk may not be working, slowing up an ordinarily smooth process. For that reason, Customs and Border Protection suggests having both programs so that whenever possible, you have the option of choosing the shorter line.  (For those interested in enrolling in Global Entry, some credit cards offer statement credits to customers who charge the fee to their cards, like Chase Sapphire Reserve, Citi Prestige and certain American Express cards.)  Members of Global Entry typically also receive membership in T.S.A. PreCheck, the expedited security program that allows them to use designated airport lanes that don’t require members to remove their shoes or their liquids and laptops from their bags (if you don’t do much international travel you can apply just for T.S.A. PreCheck; the fee is $85 for five years). For a while, some travelers who weren’t members of the program were being allowed to the use the PreCheck lanes when they weren’t full. But last year the Transportation Security Administration began cutting down on that practice. If you’re a frequent traveler, you may also want to check out Customs and Border Protection’s Nexus and Sentri programs; Nexus is for those who travel between the United States and Canada (Canadian citizens and residents enrolled in Nexus are allowed to use Global Entry kiosks), while Sentri is for travel into the United States by land from Mexico. Another program, Clear, costs $179 a year for individuals and is not a government-run program. Although T.S.A. PreCheck allows you to join a lane with fewer security requirements, you must first still wait in line (albeit usually a shorter one) to reach a checkpoint where someone looks at your I.D. With Clear, you go directly to a kiosk (where you scan your iris or fingerprints) and are then escorted to the physical security check, bypassing the lines to the identification checkpoints. If you’re also enrolled in T.S.A. PreCheck, you can step into that particular lane. If you don’t have PreCheck, you join the regular lane where you must remove your shoes, belt and the usual items from your bags like liquids and laptops.

5a967dea410cf7000162e630,2018-02-28T10:00:48+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/travel/ipoh-malaysia-tourism.html,Travel,"In the middle of the 1900s, the northwestern Malaysian town of Ipoh was the world’s largest producer of tin and its booming success showed. Informally described by locals as the “town that tin built,” Ipoh grew from a sleepy village in the valley of the Kinta River to a hotbed of cabarets, night life and conspicuous consumption, a city fueled by the fortunes of the Chinese-mining towkays (bosses). But the collapse of tin prices in the 1980s curbed the city’s rise and soon Ipoh faded, existing primarily as a pleasant place to retire (the surrounding limestone karst mountains are beautiful and the resulting hard water is claimed to make food taste better), or as an eating stop for travelers shuttling between the mountain region of Cameron Highlands to the east and the island of Penang to the northwest. But Ipoh, Malaysia’s third most populous city, and one largely unknown outside of Southeast Asia, is staging a comeback to become the country’s hippest destination. The city’s fortunes began to improve in 2004 when the water theme park Lost World of Tambun opened, backed by the Malaysian conglomerate Sunway Group (its founder and chairman Jeffrey Cheah Fook Ling was born close to Ipoh). More recently, in 2014, the Lithuanian artist Ernest Zacharevic, as he had done in Penang’s Georgetown, placed his imprimatur on the city by beautifying old buildings with a series of murals. But perhaps the greatest change — one propelled by homegrown talent — has been the boom in hip cafes over the last few years. Ipoh, now, is roaring back in style. The city, the capital of Perak state, has a core that is relatively compact, with roads largely plotted in a grid system — planners redrafted the town after parts of it were destroyed in a sweeping fire in 1892 — so it’s easily walkable. (Be prepared to sweat; year-round daytime temperatures hover around a humid 90 degrees). It also has a number of pretty shop-house and heritage buildings around the Old Town, like the Railway Museum playfully referred to by the British during the colonial era as the Taj Mahal of Ipoh. The catalyst for Ipoh’s new tilt was arguably the Sekeping Kong Heng hotel. Opened six years ago, it took the peeling bones of a hostel once used by performers at a Cantonese opera and updated the interiors with glass and steel; the effect is remarkable, modern and yet artfully dilapidated, a sensitive reimagining of a storied, decrepit space. The hotel opened on Kong Heng Square in the city’s Old Town, and was soon followed by other newcomers nearby, such as the cafe Burps & Giggles. Offering a simple menu of bar food — burgers, pizza, fish and chips — its most appealing aspect is the almost hallucinatory interior, with junk furniture, mismatched furnishings, haphazardly cobbled-together lamps and the centerpiece mural of a woman with curly red hair who seems lost in thought. It was a novel concept for a town more famous for bare-bones restaurants serving food like ayam tauge (cold chicken with beansprouts) and nasi kandar, a rice with honeyed chicken and curry sauce, locally known as nasi ganja for its addictive qualities and ability to put the diner to sleep.>> Other businesses followed. Patisserie BoutiQue opened on the street called Jalan Sultan Yussuf with a menu of salads, soups, sandwiches, pasta and excellent desserts (the tiramisù has dense mascarpone and a strong kick of Baileys Irish Cream), and an interior with whitewashed exposed brick walls, white subway tiles, poured concrete floors and a soundtrack of old French songs. Around the corner, Plan B is a contemporary restaurant with a high ceiling, giant windows and tile floors. The menu is international but pays homage to Malay ingredients; the spaghetti agli olio features bunga kantan (torch ginger flower), the pungent, floral plant used in the Southeast Asian dishes rojak and laksa, lending the Italian classic an Asian flavor profile. Cafes continue to open in the town’s colonnaded shophouses, tucked between established businesses like silk shops, watch repairers and travel agents. Chokodok (Malay for banana fritter) has accommodations above its intriguing, tumbledown, reggae-themed restaurant. Opened by two brothers who had spent some time in the islands off the coast of Peninsular Malaysia, it has tree trunks as decorations, the flotsam and jetsam of a beach shack, and music that’s consistently reggae. A former orphanage on the eastern fringe of central Ipoh transformed into Thumbs Café, an eclectically furnished restaurant specializing in Malay dishes. M Boutique, a hotel that mixes the rustic, industrial and whimsy, became the city’s most high-style property in an area rife with used-car showrooms. When it opened “this concept was not available here,” said Joey Chong, a sales executive for the hotel. “Lots of youngsters come from Kuala Lumpur [two hours away by car or train] for the cafe hopping. It’s much easier to get around here than in K.L.” But the trend isn’t confined to central Ipoh. A number of cool joints have sprung up in Ipoh Gardens East, a commercial and residential area near the Aeon Mall. Tea Coffee Game opened among a drab row of businesses and office buildings. It has bright interiors, Ikea furniture, and there’s a utilitarian feel to it, but its conceit is the games found throughout — traditional board games like checkers and ludo as well as a video console.“We have games to make the place different, to help people revisit their childhood, bring them good memories for when the food is served,” Chung Kok Heung, a science lecturer at a local university and a co-owner, told me one evening. “A few years ago most youngsters here moved to other countries, but now people are coming back because they like the food, the environment, the slower lifestyle.” Its menu, as I found often in this new breed of restaurants, focuses on Western food and includes a pretty salad served in a Mason jar, full of crisp green and purple cabbage, peppers, carrots, cherry tomatoes, and served with smooth sesame dressing. A big draw here is the all-day breakfast, with up to seven items like bacon, grilled tomatoes, eggs and hash browns, costing only 19 Malaysian ringgits (about $5). Nearby, Zakka Loft has colorful curtains; a sky mural with the words “Do You Have a Dream?”; a wall unit full of knitted soft toys (it offers workshops on how to make them); and fabulous iced fruit drinks. These places are free from hipster posturing and have an easygoing ambience. Of all the cafes and restaurants I visited, one stood out. Classically trained chef Sam Lau left Ipoh in his early 20s to work in kitchens around Asia and Europe, returning to his hometown after 16 years. “I came back to my country and couldn’t find good bread,” he lamented. Thus began a mission; for two years he sold bread from his bicycle outside the restaurant Plan B. In December 2016 he opened Artisan Handmade Bread in an old shop-house near Kong Heng Square, where he works in a small open kitchen behind the bread counter. “I am up at 3 a.m. every day, baking bread, running the kitchen. Ipoh people are old-fashioned, they like value for money.” The excellent food is a steal — the set-lunch menu (he closes for the day at 4 p.m.) includes soup, a main dish, an amuse bouche, dessert and lemon iced tea, for 28 ringgits. Despite his background and training, Mr. Lau avoided opening a formal-dining restaurant. “The young generation doesn’t want fine dining. It wants good food and casual. I want to provide good honest food cooked right in front of you, bistronomy style. And I also want to educate locals on what goes into commercial bread and artisan bread.” His bread is outstanding, fibrous and supple, and justly anchors the menu — generous chunks served with the mixed vegetable soups, thick slices bookending the grilled sandwiches. “Lots of youngsters leave here to come back, they want to share what they learned from overseas and show something new to Ipoh,” Mr. Lau said. Ipoh is all the richer for it.",8004

But it’s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers.  By Jada Yuan Driving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn’t recognize the name, and she wouldn’t elaborate. “You’re going to have to do your homework on that one,” she said, “because my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.”  Ms. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words “Dream Destroyed” and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours — explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.  Within about 10 seconds, she’d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. “He’s known as the father of modern gynecology,” she said. “He enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.” Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. “We are starting an initiative,” she said, “because we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.” The “we” she refers to is a group she’s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims’s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success. Montgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I’ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times’ 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I’d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is — how shall I put this — heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)  The city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.  I’d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. “His office is right there!” Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore’s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.  What really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country’s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.  The six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.  The Initiative’s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation’s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.) Upon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country’s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.  “You need a taxi, ma’am?” one of them asked. “He just left, so it’s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.” “Now, where’s my taxi driver?” the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: “Nick, there’s a lady waiting for you.” It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.  I’d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I’d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.  That evening, I went to the city’s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. “You could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue” — downtown’s main drag — “and not hit a person on a Sunday,” Barry Ponstein, Bonnie’s husband told me later. “Everyone’s at church.” The one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he’s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he’s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more “godly” leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was “mistreated” and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.  “It’s interesting to me, too,” said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He’s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse’s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.  “My mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that’s the most she’s ever made,” he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven’t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. “It’s O.K.,” he said. “Poverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you’re going to come out of it eventually.” Later, he declared, “Come back and see me when I have my Bentley.”  The ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city’s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn’t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: “What else are they going to do? It’s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!”  When I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown’s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, “Central is so expensive, you’d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.” We went to Applebee’s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.  I did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good — part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists — and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI — as well as keep its old “Whites Only” and “Colored Only” signs on display for posterity. I’m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch — inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country’s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.  I met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city’s history but said it fueled their ambitions. “We’re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,” said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, “and the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it’s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.”  My best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I’d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B’s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that’s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King’s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher’s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he’s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.  Following the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams’s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He’d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the “old money” neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, “if you’ll notice, you don’t see any black folks living in there.” I did notice.  Mr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. “Even through the segregation and hatred,” he said, “Montgomery, I wouldn’t trade it. I’ve been here my whole life and I’ve enjoyed every day.”  This year, the city will erect its first statue to Dr. King, in front of the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where he used to preach near the Capitol. The statues of J. Marion Sims and Jefferson Davis, erected in 1939 and 1940, will be in view, too. Alabama will remain one of two states that celebrate the King and Lee birthdays in a combined holiday. This is how change seems to come in Montgomery: messy and long overdue. Still, how wonderful to see progress in action. Jada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year’s 52 Places to Go list. Her next dispatch will be from Disney Springs, Fla.

By Abby Ellin The question came at check-in: Did I want to forgo housekeeping for the two days I was staying at the Flamingo in Las Vegas in exchange for a $10 a day food and beverage credit? Huh? The clerk repeated himself. Some guests, he explained, didn’t want to be bothered during their stay — hangovers and all that. So last summer the Flamingo, along with nearly all of its sister properties in Vegas (it is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment), decided to give people the chance to decline having their rooms cleaned in exchange for a voucher.  I’m familiar with the card in the room suggesting guests reuse their towels and sheets to help the environment, but I’d never heard of hotels eliminating housekeeping altogether. But more and more are doing just that, and extending rebates, hotel points and other perks for those who take them up on their offer. It’s a smart business move, industry experts say. “A lot of hotels were becoming more aware of what consumers like,” said Adam Weissenberg, the global leader of travel and hospitality for Deloitte, in Parsippany, N.J.  “They received criticism from younger travelers. ‘This is ridiculous that they’re changing my towels and sheets every day. I don’t need that, it does harm the environment.’” According to MMGY Global’s Portrait of American Travelers, 2017-2018, 13 percent of United States travelers say that they have selected a travel service provider specifically for environmental considerations, up from 11 percent in 2014. Thirty-eight percent said they would be willing to pay more for a travel service provider who demonstrates environmental responsibility, a 13 percent increase from 2014.  “What we’ve seen fairly steadily over the course of five plus years among travelers is that there’s a general sense and appreciation for anything related to sustainability and environmental issues,” said Craig Compagnone, senior vice president of business strategy at MMGY.  The thinking is that eradicating housekeeping is better for the environment, and for the hotels’ bottom line. After all, if you’re not washing towels and bedding, you’re saving water — and money. You’re also not sending as many chemicals into the sewer system. “So that’s better from a water perspective,” said Jeanne Marie Varney, who teaches courses on sustainability at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration. “You get the benefit of not using cleaning chemicals in the rest of the room. Not running vacuum cleaners saves energy.” Starwood launched its initiative at the Sheraton Seattle in 2008. Guests who declined housekeeping service for up to three consecutive days received a choice of either 500 Starpoints (in its Starwood Preferred Guests program) or a $5 food and beverage gift card.  While leisure guests occasionally opted in, frequent business travelers “ate it up,” said James Gancos, the chief executive and founder of the Guestbook, a loyalty program for independent boutique hotels, and the former hotel manager at the Sheraton Seattle. “They told us, ‘I love being green, I love the extra points, I didn’t want people in my room anyway.” That program became Make a Green Choice and Starwood rolled it out to all of its brands except the St. Regis after Marriott International acquired Starwood in 2016, the company implemented similar programs in about 20 of its 30 brands in North America, including Marriott, JW Marriott, Westin, Sheraton, Delta, Renaissance, W, Courtyard, and Fairfield Inn & Suites. Under the Your Choice and Luxury of Choice programs at full-service hotels, guests are eligible for 500 Marriott Rewards points per day. Delta’s GreenSTAY offers guests the option to receive 250 Marriott Rewards points or have a tree planted. Some smaller hotels have also started doing it. Miramonte Indian Wells Resort and Spa, in Indian Wells, Calif., offers a $5 food and beverage credit, and Suncadia Resort, in Cle Elum, Wash., offers guests a $5 resort credit per day that can be used at its coffee shop, spa or fitness center. The hotel Bardessono, in Yountville, Calif., will plant one herb a day per guest in an on-site organic garden. This month, the Ridgeline Hotel in Estes Park, Colo., is launching a free drink incentive for each night guests stay and decline housekeeping.  While it’s unclear how many people take advantage of these sorts of programs, Delta recently celebrated its 100,000th tree being planted since the program’s inception. Marriott says it has lowered its energy use by 13.2 percent, its water use by 7.7 percent and its greenhouse gas emissions by 15.8 percent between 2007 and 2016.  Other hotels say they simply don’t want to bother guests on vacation.  The Moorings Village in Islamorada, Fla., which has 19 private villas, discontinued housekeeping on its property altogether. The property will only clean when a guest requests it.  Why? The general manager Debbie Pribly put it this way: “Our hotel team noticed that guests didn’t want their relaxation to be interrupted and don’t want to feel like they’re on a routine while vacationing, so we offer housekeeping by request only,” she said. “This allows us to adhere to the guest’s schedule, offering a cleaning only when it’s convenient for them rather than convenient for the hotel.”          Advertisement",5460

Before the debates on truth and beauty with her circle of early 20th-century artists, intellectuals and writers known as the Bloomsbury Group; before the polemic feminist lectures at Cambridge; and before the ever-constant push to experiment with new forms of fiction, there was the impressionable young girl, born Adeline Virginia Stephen, who spent seaside summers in Cornwall, on England’s rugged southwestern tip. On a gray morning last October, I found myself on the Great Western Railway, rolling along the same route that Woolf would have taken about a century before, the train hugging tight past a progression of wide swathes of golden sand and languidly sloping green cliffs, with the deep blue of St. Ives Bay and the Godrevy Lighthouse in the distance. The rail line to the coastal town of St. Ives opened in 1877, causing a huge uptick in tourism there, and it is easy to understand how it would have lured well-to-do Britons like her family to this once hard-to-reach stretch of Cornwall, now a thriving arts haven with its own branch of the Tate museum. Long an admirer of this modernist literary pioneer, not only for how Woolf redefined the possibilities of the novel but, for the simple reason that no other writer has given me, sentence for sentence, such pleasure, I decided to go in search of Woolf in her early years. I headed to the vast coastal county that, by most accounts, had a profound effect on her future writing, making its way into the novels “Jacob’s Room” and “The Waves,” and forming the basis of one of her greatest works, “To the Lighthouse.” Woolf’s summers in Cornwall were a reprieve from her upper-middle-class life in London, where, for most of the year, she spent her days in “the rich red gloom” of a tall London townhouse. A Victorian girl bound by Victorian-era trappings, she took informal school lessons in a dining room filled with carved oak and marble, ventured on monotonous twice-daily outings to nearby Kensington Park, and awaited a future of ballroom dances in satin dresses and pearls. Her father, the renowned literary critic and historian, Sir Leslie Stephen, rented a house overlooking St. Ives Bay in Cornwall, which he described in an 1884 letter as “a pocket-paradise with a sheltered cove of sand in easy reach (for ‘Ginia even) just below.” That house, that bay, that lighthouse: all would be immortalized in her famous novel. While Woolf was always careful to abstract somewhat from her personal past, and set “To the Lighthouse” on the Scottish Isle of Skye, it’s steeped with almost direct imagery from her time in Cornwall. From 1882, when she was only a few months old, to 1894, when she was 12, the year before her mother died, Woolf spent a few months each year in Talland House, situated on the outskirts of St. Ives, then a small fishing town on the Cornish coast. It was the sheer physical freedom of Cornwall, compared to the constrictions of Woolf’s London life, suggest the scholars Marion Dell and Marion Whybrow in “Virginia Woolf & Vanessa Bell: Remembering St. Ives,” that helped her buck against the constructs of her day and conceive of independent achievement. Woolf roamed free in the salty air of the sloping garden, with the expanse of the bay and its distant lighthouse before her. She swam and poked among rock pools down at the beach below, and hunted great-winged moths on rambling nighttime expeditions. “In retrospect nothing that we had as children made as much difference, was quite so important to us, as our summer in Cornwall. The country was intensified, after the months in London,” and formed “the best beginning to life conceivable,” she wrote in 1940 at age 58, in her autobiographical essay, “A Sketch of the Past.” Celebrating St. Ives’s outsized role in Woolf’s life, and a marker in its own right for how far the town has grown, is the recently refurbished and extended Tate St. Ives, one of only two branches of the art museum outside London, which runs “Virginia Woolf: An Exhibition Inspired by Her Writings” until April 29 in its sprawling new hall. But while St. Ives has dramatically evolved from Woolf’s day, some parts of Cornwall, a sprawling county with a population of over half a million, seem frozen in time. Just down the coast, I found a rural, stark, ethereally beautiful landscape that remains today, despite the occasional car and hurtling tractor, close to how Woolf would have remembered it as a child. Once a 10-hour trek from London, the train voyage to St. Ives today can be made in under six. Winding my way up from the town’s sole rail station, as Woolf and her family would have done — with cooks, servants and mounds of luggage — the mid-19th-century stone villa looms large, seemingly incongruous among the motley assortment of architecture that has sprung around it, like the glossy modern apartment complex, with glass balconies, next door. “Her family would move their entire way of life, their whole household, for two or three months out of the year to this house with a magical garden in this very remote setting, and it would become a kind of Eden for her, the place she would idealize and always remember,” said Alexandra Harris, author of “Virginia Woolf” and a professorial fellow at the University of Birmingham in England. “In ‘To the Lighthouse,’ Woolf, as a successful middle-aged writer, comes face to face with her mother in the garden which is very much the garden at Talland House,” Ms. Harris said. “The novel embodies the feeling of having left something unfinished through those childhood summers.” “To the Lighthouse” encapsulates Woolf’s love and longing for her mother — as well as her conflicted view of her mother’s vision of Victorian womanhood. All those bottled-up feelings, seemingly suspended in time after the family gave up Talland House following Julia Stephen’s death, found their release in the novel. Woolf herself wrote as much in “A Sketch of the Past:” “ … when it was written, I ceased to be obsessed by my mother. I no longer hear her voice; I do not see her.” While Talland House was carved into five flats in the 1950s and isn’t open to the public, visitors can, from Talland Road above, catch a glimpse of the sloping garden, the house’s cream-colored facade and views across St. Ives Bay to the iconic Godrevy Lighthouse. Though for the best tableau, it’s best to mimic the writer and her three siblings on their first trip back to the house as adults. “We passed through the gate, groped stealthily but with sure feet up the carriage drive, mounted the little flight of rough steps,” wrote Woolf in a 1905 diary entry, adding that they peered through a chink in the escallonia hedge and “hung there like ghosts.” The original wooden gate no longer exists, though the “rough steps” and hedging, now about chest-height, are still there, beyond which is a full-on view of the house and its stately French windows and balconies. Visitors can also walk up the paved driveway, the former “carriage drive,” around the side of the garden, said Peter Eddy, the house’s longtime owner (with his brother, John Eddy), who met me there. I found Mr. Eddy with a few of the house’s current residents, Woolf enthusiasts who are also deeply embedded in the town’s fabric (one is the chairman of the St. Ives Chamber of Trade and Commerce, another a volunteer at the St. Ives Archive). Ad hoc gatekeepers of the Talland House myth, they were poring over a map of the property from 1906 and historical photos, which showed a smaller and less imposing house. (Roof and side extensions were added later.) I walked around, soaking up the spirit of the place. The garden is more manicured now, lacking the bursts of color from fiery red-hot pokers, and various pockets of charm, which were given names like the “love corner,” “coffee garden” and “lookout place,” that had defined the original garden. Yet a few relics remain, including feathery spears of pampas grass near where Woolf would have played evening games of cricket, and mixed hedging around the garden’s bottom border that included Woolf’s beloved escallonia, “whose leaves, pressed, gave out a very sweet smell.” Looking across St. Ives Bay from the garden, I recalled one of the best-known lines from “To the Lighthouse:” “For the great plateful of blue water was before her; the hoary Lighthouse, distant, austere, in the midst …” Woolf fans have been concerned about the obstruction of this view ever since Cornwall Council granted planning permission in December 2015 for an apartment complex to be built below Talland House. But on my visit, it was not clear to me this would happen. I couldn’t find any signs of construction, and permission is set to expire if work doesn’t start by December 2018. Just minutes’ walk away is Primrose Valley, an area once blanketed with apple orchards and a little dirt path that Woolf and her youthful siblings would have taken down to Porthminster Beach below. Now, sprawling houses with gray-shingled mansard roofs edge up to one another, with hedging and moss-covered stone lining a paved route. The beach, though, with its wide crescent of smooth, powdery sand and turquoise bay, still retains its essential, sweeping majesty. From the beach, it was a few blocks to the center of St. Ives. I walked past a girl with a butterfly net, and thought of Woolf, and got lost among the labyrinth of cobbled streets. But I couldn’t find much left of the “windy, noisy, fishy, vociferous, narrow-streeted town” as Woolf recalled it. Long gone are the wooden boats that would have been anchored near the shore, awaiting the pilchards — small, sardine-like fish that would come into the bay by the millions. All that has largely been scrubbed clean, replaced with a more tourist-friendly image: St. Ives, the arts haven by the sea. Woolf was witness to the beginning of this change. In “To the Lighthouse,” she noted that the artists had already started to come to the fictional fishing town inspired by St. Ives, perhaps a reference to the American painter Whistler, who stayed in St. Ives in 1883 and 1884. In the early- to mid-20th century, a new wave of artists made their way there, most notably Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson and Naum Gabo, whose abstract sculptures and paintings were inspired by the area’s landscape. For the first time, these modernist works have a permanent dedicated space in the Tate St. Ives, which has a vast new extension dug into a hillside off Porthmeor Beach, a favored spot with surfers that doubled the museum’s gallery area in October. While traces of Woolf’s work were noticeably absent at the museum in autumn, “Virginia Woolf: An Exhibition Inspired by Her Writings,” showcases the works of more than 80 artists, including her sister, the painter and Bloomsbury Group member Vanessa Bell, who have either been directly influenced by Woolf or explore recurring themes important to Woolf, such as feminist perspectives on domesticity. Bell, one of Woolf’s greatest confidantes, received a rather alarming letter, written on Christmas Day, 1909. “I went for a walk in Regents Park yesterday morning, and it suddenly struck me how absurd it was to stay in London, with Cornwall going on all the time,” Woolf wrote. Woolf impulsively purchased a train ticket and arrived at the Lelant station, near St. Ives, at 10:30 p.m., without “spectacles, cheque book, looking glass, or coat.” Pacing that same platform recently, I was struck by how Woolf might have chosen her lodging: The Lelant Hotel, now The Badger Inn, was the closest accommodation, looming large up a short, steep walk to the top of Station Hill. There, I met Paul O’Brien, the pub’s historian, who has put together snippets of Woolf’s letters about Lelant, a village of 1,056 residents, in a frame that hangs on a wall near the bar. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and convivial locals were drinking pints of St. Austell’s Tribute, a popular regional ale, their dogs underfoot. From The Badger Inn, it’s about seven miles to Godrevy, a beach and headland that is now part of the National Trust. There, sunlight streamed down through the clouds and seemed to reflect the golden sands, lighting up the whole place in the area’s infamously soft glow. I walked past wild flowing grasses before reaching the closest point on shore to Godrevy Island and its lighthouse. And then the literary landmark stood before me: stark, solid, sacrosanct. Woolf’s next trip to Cornwall was more scripted. Back in London and nearing, at age 28, the end of her first novel, “The Voyage Out,” Woolf spiraled into a mental breakdown so severe it landed her in Burley Park, a home for mentally ill women outside the city. (While Hermione Lee, arguably the foremost Woolf expert, called her “a sane woman who had an illness” in her biography “Virginia Woolf,” she also associated Woolf’s symptoms with what would now be recognized as manic-depressive illness or bipolar disorder.) Part of her recuperation that summer was a walking tour around Zennor, the name of both a tiny village and parish (population 207), just southwest of St. Ives, with a nurse, Jean Thomas. Tramping through a light mist, I found my way to the handsome stone farmhouse where Woolf and Ms. Thomas stayed, now the private residence of Lee and William Berryman, whose family has lived and worked on the surrounding farmland for more than 400 years. Inside their cozy sitting room, Ms. Berryman and I pored over small sepia-colored photographs, some nearly a century old, of former lodgers. (My heart leapt when I found one of two women sharing a motorcycle and sidecar, though, while possessing the same independent spirit, it ended up not being Woolf and her nurse.) Then we ventured outside, touring two nearby structures that have been turned into holiday accommodations, called Porthmeor Cottages. Chickens pecked outside a coop, and in the distance, cattle grazed open pastureland that seemed to drop off into the sea below. Three years later, in 1913, a similar pattern of illness emerged. Woolf sank into periods of severe depression, and was again admitted to Burley Park. In September, Woolf attempted suicide. After a period of rest, she slowly improved, and with her husband in 1914, headed again to Cornwall. They spent a portion of their stay at Carbis Bay, a seaside resort village about a mile and a half up the coast from St. Ives, that is today dotted with tanned surfers in wet suits on the beach and, looming above, whitewashed, glass-fronted villas. The Carbis Bay Hotel & Estate, where the Woolfs stayed, has its own beach that was awarded Blue Flag eco-certification, as well as a spa. Its palm-tree-fringed views of the sweeping turquoise bay could have been from anywhere, more Caribbean than Woolf’s Cornwall. Except there, in the distance, was the Godrevy Lighthouse, and in a hallway off a glass conservatory hangs a photo of the couple from around that time, with Woolf’s guest signature in purple, below. During the 1920s and 1930s, a creatively fruitful time for Woolf, when she worked on the three novels most closely associated with Cornwall, the couple mainly stayed in the parish of Zennor whenever they visited the area. As I made my way around its medieval farming tracts, sweeping moors and winding coastal paths, I understood why. It was an antidote not just to the frenzy of London, but also to the rapid growth of St. Ives and Carbis Bay. Off the main road and onto a dirt track sits the tiny hamlet of Poniou, which then, as now, consists of only three cottages beside three granite footbridges. I met Sue Allen, a longtime resident, who told me the Woolfs had stayed next door in 1921, with their bedroom facing the sea. Woolf marveled at seeing Gurnard’s Head, a glorious headland named for the local fish, from that bedroom window. Then as now, it remains the most distinctive landmark in the area. But it is still, as Woolf described it, “so lonely,” reachable either along a winding “rabbit path round the cliff,” or by following a faintly visible path through fields dotted with grazing cattle and rudimentary stone steps. Taking in the faintly sweet smell of cow dung and the roar of the waters crashing against the rocks below, I didn’t pass a single soul on two trips in October. About three miles away is the private residence Eagle’s Nest, distinct and visible from the main road. The Woolfs stayed there with friends on several memorable visits, including on Christmas Day, 1926, which Woolf spent revising drafts of “To the Lighthouse.” She despaired that “All my facts about Lighthouses are wrong,” in a letter to an assistant at the publishing house, Hogarth Press, which she and her husband set up and ran. The couple stayed there again in May 1936, Woolf’s last trip, at age 54, to Cornwall, an attempt to keep yet another breakdown at bay. They wandered round St. Ives and crept into the garden of Talland House, and in the dusk, her husband wrote, “Virginia peered through the ground-floor windows to see the ghosts of her childhood.” I peered through those same windows, and I imagined the writer trying to recapture a vanished past when life had felt so new, seeing only inescapable childhood ghosts basking in summer days of exquisite happiness.",17271

By Nell McShane Wulfhart The comedian Lewis Black, known for his abrasive, expletive-laden style of stand-up, appears regularly on late night talk shows and has released 12 comedy albums. His latest, “Lewis Black — Black to the Future,” was released last fall. Mr. Black travels the country doing as many as 200 shows a year, so he has become obsessed with finding direct flights — “All I care about are direct flights. My life is devoted to direct flights” — and even arranges his travel so that he’s leaving his New York apartment to get to Newark airport at low-traffic times. “Between 11 and 12 in the afternoon, that’s the window. Plus, usually, traffic in the airport, too, has gone down at that point.”  When on the road, he also spends considerable time on the tour bus. “If I have two weeks back-to-back out west, or you know, in the middle of the country, then it makes sense that I don’t get off the bus. So I’ll spend two or three days on the bus traveling to the next set of shows.” He’s written most of his three books on buses in between shows and recommends it for anyone trying to write. “Yeah, but on a tour bus. A Greyhound, it’s not going to happen. You’re going to kill yourself after 12 hours.” Here’s what he takes on every trip. Melatonin gummy bears “I got advice from a military friend who travels a lot and has wackier hours than I do, and they suggested melatonin gummy bears.

Probably doctors will say I’m wrong, but it does work.” Marijuana edibles “I’m not doing this to get high, I’m doing this to go to sleep. But boy, some of those edibles I have done to try to go to sleep and I’m like, oh no I’m going to sit here and review everything. Once a guy on my tour bus said, ‘Let’s take a little of this and it’ll knock us out.’ But we were up all night and I went through every relationship I’ve ever had, every one, and how I failed, and what was my fault, and it was exhausting. Eventually, I fell asleep but it was mostly because I had run out of relationships.” Neti pot “I bring a neti pot. How sad is that? I’ve always had kind of a sinus-y problem, and flying doesn’t help that at all. You know, it dries you the hell out. Essentially what you’re doing, you’re breathing the filth, essentially. The longer you’re on a plane, the more filth you’re breathing.” Necklace “I wear this goofy thing around my neck that somebody gave me, that supposedly sucks up negative energy. Big bad thoughts get sucked into that. Why not? I don’t know if I believe in it but it was free.” Moisturizer “What it does is provide you with some sense of a regimen. People ask, ‘How do you travel that much?’ Well, you provide yourself with a daily routine. So, if you’re doing the routine in your house, you do it on the road. It helps you maintain a distance between you and the howling that is the void.”  The Week “I bring a bunch of The Weeks with me, usually three or four. I use them to catch up if I’ve missed anything over the past month. They’re really good at summarizing news. They also have a bunch of really funny pieces, you know, unusual stuff that’s occurred throughout the United States — congressmen or local representatives who say things that are so beyond appalling that you wonder how these people are in office. Or is there not a psychological unit in the area? And then I use some of that on stage to kind of give a sense to my audience that there is a level of lunacy that continues to go on in this country, and part of it is that we listen to people, who really, we shouldn’t be listening to because something’s wrong with them. And they need to see — we have a big mental health problem and a lot of it is represented by a lot of people in government. I keep saying, the largest outpatient clinic in the world is Congress.” Advertisement",4011

No car chases, though. By Lynn Freehill-Maye From $139 Northern Ireland’s — and perhaps the world’s — sole Steve McQueen-themed hotel was opened by the Beannchor Group (which also owns Belfast’s opulent Merchant Hotel) in October 2016 with 43 rooms. Last October it opened a rooftop garden terrace and bar, and in December 2017 added 31 additional rooms. Named for the late star’s car-chasing 1968 detective thriller of that title, the hotel calls itself no-frills, but the design is fun and stylish. Visitors liked the theme so much that soon after its opening, two older women tried to swipe a six-foot canvas of McQueen smoking a cigarette behind aviator shades. The near-heist generated publicity for the new hotel as the Not-So-Great Escape, but the desk clerks who checked me in swore it had been a true crime, not a stunt. As Belfast has settled into two decades of post-conflict peace, the Cathedral Quarter where the Bullitt is situated has emerged as one of the city’s most vibrant neighborhoods, with restaurants, hotels, shops, and edgy street art. The hotel is also a doable stroll from the riverfront and blockbuster Titanic Museum, as well as some of Belfast’s most character-saturated pubs. Bullitt rooms are named in three sizes: “Dinky,” Comfy” and “Roomy.” Slate-gray paint and a full-wall mural of “Bullitt” stars Steve McQueen and Jacqueline Bisset dominated our mid-sized and indeed comfortable room. Playful touches include the warning “Faceplant!” printed on the double-paned windows (which didn’t keep the childhood friend with me from bonking her head trying to see the space-themed “Intrepid Traveler” art installation outside). Replacing a closet was a bright red wire rack with a few hooks and hangers, along with a simple luggage rack, desk, TV and a tiny metal shelf for the remote. No iron was provided, but a basic model was delivered within two minutes of asking. White square tile on the walls and gray square tile on the floor, the bathroom was all business. Toiletries bcreated for the hotel were provided in a tart Irish nettle scent. An oversize rainfall showerhead was mounted high; and while the water temperature could have gone hotter, the warming towel rack was nice on a cool Belfast day. The Bullitt offers a calendar that includes events like knitting classes, literary readings and running-club jaunts. When we walked into the attractive courtyard, an artist’s lecture was happening as part of the Belfast Photo Festival. There was no in-room minibar, but supplies for hot beverages were fairly well-stocked: Dragonfly teas, Lyons instant coffee, fair-trade hot cocoa and mugs with “Hello Brewtiful” on the bottom, plus fresh milk in the tiny fridge. Basic black loaner umbrellas proved handy for Northern Ireland’s ever-threatening rain. The hotel has two happening lobby bars, one for coffee and the other for cocktails, along with a separate ski-themed bar, Baltic, that was closed during our visit, and the rooftop bar called Babel. Its restaurant, Taylor & Clay, serves meat-and-potatoes fare like a Wagyu sirloin that arrived tougher than expected; the side of creamy root veggies and peas, which subbed for fries, swiped the show. Breakfast is served at Taylor & Clay and the hotel also plays up its free Grub to Go bags, which include fruit, yogurt and granola. Preferring a hot meal, I called room service, which arrived 18 minutes later. My server said delivery was “definitely not” often ordered, and since the sourdough toast and poached eggs (about $3 each) cost less than the delivery charge (around $9), I could appreciate why. The Bullitt has a good time with its king-of-’60s-cool muse, and as Belfast re-emerges, guests who want fun with no frills are set up to play, too.

By Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan Singapore is a country of countless hawker stalls and beloved mom-and-pop restaurants that serve up excellent renditions of local dishes. So when its notoriously discerning eaters pack into a chic hotel lobby to seek out traditional fare, take note.  On a recent weeknight at Folklore, at the Destination Singapore Beach Road hotel, table after table was filled with locals tucking into dishes like pork belly braised in tamarind gravy and eggplant sambal. The cuisine here is Singapore’s so-called heritage food — and the chef behind it, Damian D’Silva, is something of an evangelist on the matter. “Our heritage food is dead or dying — a lot of the dishes that I used to eat as a kid, today, they’re no longer available,” said Mr. D’Silva, who learned to cook as a child by watching his grandparents whip up Peranakan (descendants of Chinese immigrants to the Malay Peninsula) and Eurasian classics at the stove. “It’s very important to keep them alive.” Mr. D’Silva, who ran the kitchens at various restaurants in Singapore before opening Folklore last July, has amassed a loyal following. In 2008, when he took a break from restaurants to offer Peranakan dishes and Western fare like his signature anchovy pasta in a tiny coffee shop stall, the well-heeled followed, pulling up in pricey cars for takeout or sitting on a stool to sweat over a Wagyu steak. Standouts at Folklore include singgang, a Eurasian wolf herring dish, and the must-try fried rice, which stars the deliciously rich chocolate-like insides of buah keluak, a Southeast Asian nutlike fruit. There are also standards done well, including chap chye, a Peranakan dish of vegetables and glass noodles cooked in pork and prawn stock.  Perhaps more interesting, however, is Mr. D’Silva’s foray into the more obscure. His plan is to change the menu every few months to add dishes that he said are increasingly rare — for example, kai fan, rice topped with Chinese sausage, roast pork and shredded chicken, with chicken stock poured over it right before serving. “It’s a very simple dish, but when you put hot soup on it, all those flavors seep into the rice,” said Mr. D’Silva, calling it “soul food that the laborers would eat” in the 1960s at hawker stalls in the country’s bustling quays.  And around Singapore’s major holidays — Chinese New Year, and Hindu Diwali (or Deepavali, as Singaporeans call it), Muslim Hari Raya — Mr. D’Silva is adding dishes from those culinary traditions. In the weeks around Christmas, for example, the chef served up debal, a fiery curry made with ham, roast pork and spare ribs. The dish — which Singapore’s Eurasian families traditionally have made on Boxing Day — is their way of using up Christmas leftovers. The desserts are memorable, including Mr. D’Silva’s Peranakan cakes, which would rival those of many old Singaporean bakeries. Some Western twists pop up — palm sugar syrup, used in many local desserts, came drizzled over panna cotta, and the kueh bengkah (a grated tapioca cake) appeared with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, which initially alarmed my parents, who both remarked, “You don’t eat it with ice cream!” But perhaps Mr. D’Silva is starting some new traditions of his own. After a few bites, my parents pronounced the ice cream a delightful addition. Folklore, Destination Singapore Beach Road, 700 Beach Road, Level 2; parkhotelgroup.com/en/destinationbeachroad/folklore.

By Shivani Vora Thursday’s Air France strike involving the carrier’s pilots, cabin crew and ground staff has ended, and as of today, the carrier’s operations are slowly returning back to normal, according to a statement on its website. The one-day strike disrupted the travel schedules of thousands of Air France passengers all over the world and will likely continue to do so for the next day or two, according to Michael Holtz, the owner of SmartFlyer, a global travel consultancy specializing in airlines. “It usually takes an airline 24 to 48 hours to get back on track after a strike,” he said. In the case of Air France, since the carrier anticipated the strike because workers had made clear that they would take action, Mr. Holtz said that the it likely held most of its planes in Paris, its home base. “Since the planes are sitting in Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, outbound flights from Paris should be up and running today or within the next day,” he said. In-bound flights to Paris from long-haul destinations, however, could still be delayed for 48 hours, Mr. Holtz said, because the planes need to fly from Paris to reach those destinations in order to operate the routes. “Air France has a flight from Bangkok to Paris,” he said. “The plane needs to reach Bangkok from Paris, which takes more than ten hours, before it can fly the scheduled route.” In fact, the carrier’s flight on that route is canceled today. What should Air France’s customers do if the strike has affected them? Passengers who have an Air France ticket issued on or before Feb. 19, for a flight operated by Air France or its low cost carrier Joon for travel on Feb. 22, can postpone their trip free of charge. If they choose to postpone their trip beyond Feb. 27, change their destination or origin or cancel their trip all together, Air France will issue a travel voucher that will be valid for one year; this voucher can be used for travel on Air France, Joon, KLM or Hop, another low-cost carrier, and is non-refundable. But passengers who had their flight canceled because of the strike or had a flight delay of more than five hours because of it have the option to get a refund on their tickets. If they bought their ticket directly from Air France, they should go to the Refund section on the airline’s site to apply for one. But according to Air France’s site, if they bought their ticket through a travel agent or another source, they should seek a refund directly from their point of sale.  Fliers can find out about their rights as declared by the European Parliament and Council of the European Union by visiting the Assistance and Compensation section on the airline’s site.

By Lucas Peterson Travelers eventually face the predicament of a destination that is utterly defined by one particular attraction — the Pyramids outside Cairo or the Taj Mahal in Agra, for example. The question is less “Should I see this attraction?” and more “How could I possibly not see this attraction?” But any lingering doubts I had about visiting the famed Terracotta Army, built by Emperor Qin Shihuang in the 3rd century B.C., soon dissipated when I entered the main excavation site. The life-size, chalky-gray warriors were meticulously detailed and demonstrated a stunning, almost overwhelming show of force — exactly, I’m sure, the impression the emperor wished to make. But Xian, the north-central Chinese city whose name means “western peace,” is much more than its collection of warriors. It’s one of the oldest cities in China: It has seen the likes of Marco Polo during his Silk Road journey, and been home to Buddhist sutras brought from India by Xuanzang, a monk whose journey inspired one of the greatest works of Chinese literature, “Journey to the West.” Xian was also one of the first Chinese cities introduced to Islam, and its Muslim Quarter, located in the city center, is now one of the city’s most thriving tourist areas. I had a fantastic time in the ancient city during a recent four-night excursion. It’s also one of the less expensive trips I’ve taken in the past year. One of the biggest costs? Getting there. But even that was cheap, not to mention enjoyable — my one-way ticket on a high-speed train from Chengdu to Xian cost 283 yuan, about $45. If you’re looking to take a 17-hour sleeper train, you can do that for about half the cost. A couple of tips: Get to the train station 30 minutes before you think you need to. There’s considerable security getting into the station and the trains leave precisely on time (I very nearly missed mine). Travelchinaguide.com has the best interface I’ve seen for buying Chinese train tickets online; alternatively, you can ask for help at your hotel. The journey through the countryside at 150 miles per hour took a little more than four hours. There was a notable juxtaposition of approaching Xian — a city with centuries-old 40-foot high city walls and a literal moat — in such an advanced and modern way. I emerged into the subfreezing temperatures at the North Railway Station and hopped on the subway (less than a decade old and in great shape) into the heart of the city (one-way ticket, 4 yuan), in search of the lodgings I had booked on Hostelworld.com. I can’t always do youth hostels — I’m generally too old and grumpy to be hanging around in bunk beds comparing dry shampoos with a bunch of early-20s Australian backpackers. But every now and then I stay in one, and I’m reminded that they usually, when chosen carefully, provide for a great experience, especially for the price point. That’s precisely what happened at Han Tang Inn, a homey and friendly hostel on narrow street, a quick walk from the Zhonglou (“Bell Tower”) subway station. For those on an extreme budget, $6-per-night beds in six-person shared rooms are available. I decided to “splurge,” booking a private room on the second floor with its own bathroom — at 139 yuan per night, a little more than $20, I was happy with my decision. Like all good hostels, the inn provided plenty of cushy space, a decent selection of snacks and drinks for sale, good-enough Wi-Fi, and free in-house activities like mah-jongg and calligraphy lessons. Most importantly, it gives you a built-in crew of new friends and acquaintances — perfect for exploring and checking new places out. And in my case, it gave me an easy and affordable way to check out the Terracotta Army at the Emperor Qin Shihuang’s Mausoleum Site Museum. I don’t typically like aligning myself with tour groups, but for excursions out of town (the excavation site is about an hour east of Xian), I recommend it. Unless you’re particularly facile with Chinese, arranging solo day-trips can be difficult or costly. Instead, I paid the hostel 238 yuan and joined a 10-person group one morning on a minibus out of town. “The emperor’s Chinese name was Qin Shihuang. We also called him Ying Zheng,” explained Jia Jia, our friendly and assertive tour guide, who punctuated many of her pronouncements with a definitive “hmph.” She continued: “Emperor was a good emperor. But he was also ruthless. And he was very crazy.” The emperor, she said, while achieving the unification of China and creating the great clay army, also had a fondness for torturing his subjects and a taste for mercury, thinking it was the secret to everlasting life (it was, in fact, the opposite).  There were three excavation locations at the museum, and we saved the biggest and best for last. The vast, final dig site held hundreds of soldiers, lined up in a majestic and slightly eerie show of force: infantrymen, archers, even a few horses. I was surprised when Jia Jia told us that while Qin Shihuang created around 8,000 life-size soldiers to protect him in the afterlife, only 2,000 or so have been unearthed and reassembled since local farmers made the discovery in 1974 (and only a portion of those are on public display at any given time). Many, many decades of painstaking work remain. Admission to the site, should you choose to go on your own, is 150 yuan, or 120 during the winter off-season. I was able to do most of my exploration of Xian solo, though, thanks to the compactness of the city center. I recommend making a quick stop at the Bell and Drum Towers, which closely resemble each other and are both located in the heart of the city. Tickets to each will cost 35 yuan, or you can buy a combo ticket for 50 yuan. The pagoda-like structures, with their distinctive upward-tilting eaves, are quite regal and majestic, and beautifully illuminated during the evening. They were constructed within years of each other during the 14th century by the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty — the Bell Tower rang to mark the beginning the day; the Drum Tower, its end. Another duo of complementary sights is the Giant Wild Goose and Small Wild Goose Pagodas, both south of the city walls. The larger of the two is one of Xian’s most famous structures, a sandy-colored Tang dynasty pavilion constructed in 652 A.D. to house sutras and icons brought from India by the Buddhist monk Xuanzang. The seven-story pagoda occupies the spacious and peaceful grounds of Dacien Si (Mercy Temple), which costs 50 yuan to access. Meandering around the temple grounds on a chilly day, I saw men and women lighting incense and worshiping at Sakyamuni, the main hall of the monastery. From there I entered the pagoda (this requires a separate 20-yuan ticket) and climbed the nearly 250 wooden stairs leading to the top. Created to protect the 657 volumes of Buddhist scriptures Xuanzang brought back, the pagoda yields another benefit: the views from the top are excellent, if slightly hindered by smog. (Air quality is a problem throughout China, and asthmatics and those with delicate respiratory systems should take particular notice. The government is testing measures to stem the problem in different cities, including Xian, which is experimenting with building-sized air purification towers.) To the northwest is the Small Wild Goose Pagoda (built in 707, it’s slightly younger), and while the pagoda itself is currently being restored, the area is worth visiting for a couple of reasons. The Studio of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting, in addition to traditional artwork, has a small museum dedicated to Mao Zedong that I found to be more honest and critical than I expected. It cites the “lost generation of the Cultural Revolution” and the era’s “disastrous blow on traditional Chinese culture.” A friendly employee at the shop directed me to the spacious, modern Xian Museum (free admission), which has diverse array of installations: contemporary paintings from the Taklamakan Desert region, relics from the Tang and Sui Dynasties, and, in the basement, an exhibition detailing the history of Xian. Don’t forget that the city’s ancient walls are an attraction in and of themselves. Accessible in different locations around the city, I found it easiest to enter by the main southern gate (Yongning), the most elaborate and ornate of the entrances. Tickets are 50 yuan, but I was able to score a half-off discount by showing my high-speed rail ticket from Chengdu. The ambitious can rent a bicycle on the parapets — 45 yuan for three hours — and bike the approximately 8.5 miles around the entire wall. (Given the subfreezing temperatures and poor air quality, I decided to just walk the walls for a while. I wasn’t disappointed — the views were good, and provided a nice vantage point of much of the surrounding area.) Convenient to Yongning gate, on Shuyuanmen Pedestrian Street, is Zui Chang An, the first of many outstanding restaurants in the city I sampled. I’ve done my share of eating in the world, and I’ll say that Xian has some of the tastiest and most accessible regional cuisine of any country I’ve visited. At Zui Chang An, you can get a very good version of a Shaanxi specialty called hulu ji, or calabash chicken. Steamed or stewed (or both, in some cases) and then fried and served inside of a gourd, this whole chicken (68 yuan) has tender, fall-apart meat that went well with a side of spicy, numbing cucumber seedlings (22 yuan). Getting a good breakfast near my hostel was no challenge once I discovered Ma Lao’s Diced Meat Spicy Soup, a small shop on West 1st Road. I went one morning with a fellow traveler in search of a peppery bowl of hu la tang, or hot, peppery soup, and found a long line of locals — always a good sign. The thick, tangy broth, filled with mushrooms and bamboo shoots, positively made my hair stand on end with its sharp, black pepper flavor. Along with a side of flatbread, brimming with herbs and onions, it made a for a filling and eye-opening breakfast. Two bowls and bread cost just 17 yuan. The Muslim Quarter, which begins roughly at the Drum Tower and extends north and west through a considerable swath of the city, is certainly geared toward tourists but is worth walking around for its frenetic energy, brightly lit signs that would give Vegas a run for its money, and, naturally, its tasty street food. Beiyuanmen Street, which extends northward from the Drum Tower, was a natural place to start an impromptu food tour, and I launched my exploration from there. Dodging bicycles, a crush of pedestrians, and the occasional pedicab, I wound my way through the barrage of colorful LED lights and street hawkers selling pomegranate juice, chunks of durian and roujiamo, a sandwich stuffed with chipped beef and hot, spicy oil (15 yuan). My favorite snack was a juicy stuffed pancake called xianbing, which was full of diced beef and fresh chives (10 yuan). In the hectic Muslim Quarter, your best strategy is to relax and go with the flow: The different foods and sheer variety of choice can overwhelm, but not once was I disappointed.

By Elaine Glusac For armchair travelers, a film may be the best way to get to, say, Italy — or, if you’re a ""Star Wars"" fan, the planet of Ahch-to. But for those who actually like to get on a plane, a movie’s location can determine an entire itinerary.  In fact, films and television shows often serve, long after the fact, to drive tourism. Roughly 60 million people annually choose travel destinations based on what they see on big and small screens, according to Stefan Roesch, the author of “The Experiences of Film Location Tourists” and the director of FilmQuest, which offers tours to film locations. Some films attract travelers based on their connection to place. “Sideways,” the 2004 film set in the California wine country outside of Santa Barbara, created a tourism boom that still resonates today, particularly around Buellton, which is home to several “Sideways” locations.  “It’s a cult film that people will watch before coming here to refresh their familiarity with the place,” said Kathy Vreeland, the executive director of the Buellton Chamber of Commerce & Visitor’s Bureau.  Other movies become tourist attractions even when the story is otherworldly. In New Zealand, where “The Lord of the Rings” was shot, travelers still flock to the film sets and production sites related to the trilogy that was released between 2001 and 2003, thanks in part to Tourism New Zealand’s campaign promoting them. Whether intimately associated with their settings (like “Dunkirk”) or relying on alluring destinations to create fictional locales (like “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), below are the most travel-related films of this year’s nominees and how to visit them.  The town of Ebbing in the director Martin McDonagh’s film is fictional. But Mr. McDonagh, who also wrote the screenplay for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” — about a mother’s efforts to get her daughter’s murder solved — brought the place to life via three North Carolina towns. “He wanted a Main Street, U.S.A., feel that people could easily relate to and looked like it could be Anywhere, Middle America,” said Guy Gaster, the director of the North Carolina Film Office.  Sylva, in western North Carolina, played a central role, hosting the Ebbing police department (actually a home décor store) and the advertising company across the street from which Frances McDormand’s character, Mildred Hayes, hurls flaming bombs. In nearby Dillsboro, Country Traditions, a food and wine store, played the gift shop where Mildred worked. The titular billboards were constructed on a scenic road near Black Mountain. Visit North Carolina has created a three-day itinerary that identifies many of the film locations. Mr. McDonagh’s story can’t be called inspirational, but viewers have responded to the backdrop in the region’s wooded, rolling hills rather than the plot, explained Mr. Gaster. He noted that fans of “The Last of the Mohicans,” a 1992 film with a tragic conclusion, still seek out filming sites such as Chimney Rock State Park.  “People do see the difference between what is really there and what the story line is,” he said. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, including best picture and director, “Dunkirk” captures the World War II evacuation of Allied soldiers from the port of Dunkirk in northern France in 1940. The plan, known as Operation Dynamo, saved more than 338,000 troops. The director Christopher Nolan shot much of the film in Dunkirk, where a walking tour visits Malo-les-Bains, the seaside area depicted in the movie, and East Mole, the breakwater that was vital to the evacuation and was partly rebuilt by the production (€120 for up to 30 people, or about $150). Like the popular D-Day beaches in Normandy, the real-life Dunkirk is strewn with World War II wreckage, especially visible at low tide. Near the beach, the Dunkirk 1940 Museum tells the Operation Dynamo story.  Travelers can see Dunkirk from the point of view of a Royal Air Force pilot on a 15-minute aerial tour aboard a light aircraft (€120 for up to three people).   The opening frames of the best picture nominee “Call Me by Your Name” indicate the setting is “somewhere in northern Italy.” And indeed, the film location, including the homey villa where the main characters reside, is in Lombardy, the northern region of the country that includes Milan and the Lakes Region. The enchanting countryside where the protagonists have long meals in gardens, swim in idyllic ponds and cycle through medieval towns is a seductive character in its own right. “Italy is often the backdrop for romantic stories, both onscreen and off, but the better-known destinations — Venice, Tuscany, the Amalfi Coast — are usually the settings,” said Kathy McCabe, the host of the TV show “Dream of Italy.” “This movie reminds us that there are so many more layers of Italy for travelers to explore.” The film’s director, Luca Guadagnino, centered production around the town of Crema, roughly 30 miles east of Milan, and his characters made jaunts to Lake Garda, one of the region’s lakes with an Alpine backdrop. They also visit Cremona, saluted by Unesco for its traditional violin-making, the walled city of Bergamo in the Alpine foothills and, outside of Bergamo, the dramatic Serio Waterfalls, Italy’s highest cascades. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” nominated for four Academy Awards, including original score, picks up Luke Skywalker’s story line where the previous film left off — on the planet of Ahch-to, the fictional shelter played by the real-life monastic retreat Skellig Michael, a steep and rocky island off the southwest coast of Ireland. Though the film was also shot on location in Bolivia and Croatia, the production expanded to feature more of Ireland, including coastal locations such as Loop Head in County Clare and Malin Head in Donegal. Most of these areas lie along the Wild Atlantic Way, a name given by Irish tourism to the country’s west coast.  The tour company Zicasso guides guests to many of them in a new eight-day itinerary called “Ireland and the Last Jedi Encounter” (from $2,975 a person).  The main character in “Lady Bird” can’t wait to get out of Sacramento, which she calls “the Midwest of California.” But in the course of the director Greta Gerwig’s coming-of-age film, she comes to appreciate the charms of California’s capital. Nominated in five categories, including best film, director and actress, “Lady Bird” will be the subject of new running and walking tours of Sacramento starting this month by Sac Running Tours. The 3.2-mile walking tour and the 4.5-mile running version (both $20 a person) focus on East Sacramento, including the Fabulous Forties neighborhood where the main character indulges in real estate envy, and the McKinley Park Rose Garden where she stargazes.  “Sacramento is a lot cooler than people give it credit for,” said Jenn Kistler-McCoy, the owner of Sac Running Tours. She aims to add bike tours that will range farther and include visits to other locations featured in the film, including Tower Bridge and Gunther’s Ice Cream shop. For independent travelers, Visit California has compiled a list of “Lady Bird” filming locations, including Thrift Town, where the movie mother and daughter shop for dresses. The list created by Visit Sacramento includes many of the city’s vintage neon signs captured in the film.   Advertisement",7549

Thousands of Air France passengers all over the world faced disruptions to their itineraries today, following a labor strike involving the carrier’s pilots, cabin crew and ground staff.  According to a representative from Air France’s office in Paris, 28 percent of its employees went on strike on today, which forced the airline to cancel 25 percent of its flights scheduled for the day. Long-haul flights are the most affected: the airline plans to operate only 50 percent of those scheduled to depart from Paris. However, Air France will still operate 75 percent of its medium-haul flights to and from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 85 percent of its short-haul flights. “I know of many Air France passengers who have had to rearrange their itineraries by leaving a day earlier or later or have had to reschedule their trips all together,” said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and the founder of Atmosphere Research Group. he said. Mr. Harteveldt also said that Air France is one of the largest European carriers to Africa, and fliers with Air France tickets to and from the continent may find themselves stranded. To add confusion to an already aggravating situation, Michael Holtz, the owner of SmartFlyer, a global travel consultancy specializing in airlines, said that Air France has several code share partners such as Delta Air Lines, Korean Air and Aeromexico. This could potentially mean that passengers who have purchased their tickets through those airlines may be scheduled to fly on a plane operated by Air France. “Your ticket could say Delta, but if you’re flying out of Paris or another city where Air France operates, you might actually be scheduled to take an Air France plane and find yourself grounded,” Mr. Holtz said. “Conversely, if you bought an Air France ticket, you could be flying on a plane operated by one of its partners and not at all be impacted by the strike.” (Travelers can find a list of Air France’s partner airlines on its site.) What should Air France’s customers do to avoid being affected by the strike, and what are they entitled to if it has already affected them? For one, the carrier is recommending that its fliers with reservations today postpone their trips or change their tickets at no extra cost. Passengers can reschedule their flights up to Feb. 27 free of charge. They also have the option to receive a voucher for the value of their ticket on Air France or KLM, which will be valid for one year. They can also cancel their flights and receive a full refund. Ticket holders can do so by going to their reservation information on the company's site or by calling 800-240-260 from France and 33 1 57 02 10 58 from abroad.  In addition, the airline has an “AF Connect” service, which informs its customers in 13 languages about any disruptions to their itineraries. To receive notifications from AF Connect, fliers should update their contact details in their reservation file on the company’s site. But Air France’s passengers also have legal rights, according to Justin T. Green, a lawyer at the New York City law firm Kreindler & Kreindler who specializes in aviation law. “Under European Union law, passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled are entitled to compensation,” he said.  The compensation for delays varies from 250 to 600 euros (about $310 to $740), depending on the length of the delay. For flights that are canceled, passengers are entitled to meals, local transportation and hotel accommodations, if necessary. Mr. Green said that travelers can file for compensation by filling out a form available on Air France’s site.  “You’re entitled to this compensation unless the airline can prove that the delay was caused by circumstances out of its control such as strikes,” Mr. Green said. “In this instance, however, in my opinion, Air France would have a hard time proving that it couldn’t have avoided this strike.” Air France had no comment regarding Mr. Green's statement.  If there’s any good news to report about the strike, both Mr. Holtz and Mr. Harteveldt say that it’s likely to be short-lived. “Airline strikes in Europe are common and usually last a day, but the impact from them can last for several days,” Mr. Harteveldt said.

By Shivani Vora Part of the appeal of booking accommodations through Airbnb is that no single stay is the same. Each home has its own personality, décor and amenities. But this individualized approach can also be a drawback because travelers can never be quite sure what they’ll find when they arrive at the property they have reserved. Will the bathroom have toilet paper and is the kitchen going to be fully stocked? Will there be sheets on the bed, and is the home clean or cluttered and run-down? Now, for the first time, Airbnb’s customers can have answers to all these questions and then some when they’re considering where to stay. Today, to coincide with its 10th anniversary, the company is launching Airbnb Plus, a brand of accommodations that are guaranteed to meet 100 different criteria and come with certain amenities. Airbnb’s chief executive, Brian Chesky, is scheduled to announce the news about Airbnb Plus at a news conference in San Francisco this morning at the Masonic, an auditorium in the city’s Nob Hill neighborhood. Mr. Chesky is also planning to announce new categories on the company’s site and tell attendees about another new brand, Beyond by Airbnb, that will be introduced in late spring and that will offer luxury rentals. Although the company has had 300 million overnight stays since it started in 2008 with a website to book overnight stays on airbeds, it’s still not mainstream enough, Mr. Chesky said, and that’s exactly what he wants to change. “We have evolved, but we think we can go much further and offer something for everyone,” he said in an interview with The New York Times. “Some travelers want predictability and certain comforts, and Airbnb Plus will give them these.” Airbnb Plus is debuting with more than 2,000 homes in 13 cities including Los Angeles, Toronto, Milan and Shanghai. By the end of this year, according to Mr. Chesky, these numbers will grow to include over 75,000 homes in more than 50 destinations. In comparison, Airbnb’s main platform has more than 4.5 million listings in 81,000 cities. One example of an Airbnb Plus listing is a two-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Chicago’s Chinatown neighborhood with balcony views as well as brick and timber touches; it has a nightly rate of $288. Like all Plus homes, the property meets the 100-point quality checklist. The kitchen, for one, is stocked with cooking equipment such as pots and pans and knives and has a clean refrigerator with no stains or damage. The bedrooms that guests stay in have an ironing board, a closet, drawers, window treatments and beds with soft, clean bedding and comfortable mattresses. In the bathroom, the cabinets are free of personal items; the shower, tiles and floors don’t have cracks or mildew; and there are two sets of plush towels. Toiletries include shampoo. More comforts means higher prices: the average nightly rate of an Airbnb Plus home is $200, compared with the $100 average rate per night for a standard listing. Mr. Chesky said that the quality standards were established after a team of employees interviewed several hundred of Airbnb’s top-rated hosts. “We asked them what they did to earn those ratings and discovered that they all had well-stocked homes and delivered a consistent experience to their guests,” he said. Aspiring hosts must apply to have their homes accepted into Airbnb Plus, and once they do, the company will send a local photographer — many of whom are Airbnb hosts themselves — to inspect their properties and determine if they meet the required standards.  Airbnb’s lack of quality control has at times been problematic for the company, according to Dr. Rummy Pandit, the executive director of the Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality and Tourism at Stockton University in New Jersey. “It is such a large and dispersed network that there have been challenges in managing a level of standardization,” he said. For this reason, Dr. Pandit said, the new Plus brand is a smart business move. “There is an untapped segment of travelers who haven’t used Airbnb because they don’t like surprises, but now, they may be open to booking a stay through the site,” he said. In addition to Airbnb Plus, the company’s main site now will have four new property types — boutique hotels, bed-and-breakfasts, vacation homes and distinctive properties such as tree houses and yurts. These are in addition to the three it already has — shared spaces, private rooms and entire homes. The listings in these categories are already on the site, but classifying them makes them easier for travelers to find, Mr. Chesky said. Collections, properties suited for a certain demographic of travelers like families and honeymooners, is also debuting today. Next up, in late spring, Airbnb will introduce Beyond by Airbnb, a collection of high-end homes for luxury-seeking travelers. This is following its purchase last year of the home rental company Luxury Retreats. “We’re still affordable, but we want to offer another tier of homes to travelers who want a more upscale experience,” Mr. Chesky said. HomeAway, another home rental company, has listings of more than two million homes in 190 countries and launched a high-end division, Luxury Rentals from HomeAway, in 2013 with 4,000 listings. That number has since grown to more than 11,400 listings in 80 countries. Airbnb could see similar success if the company can deliver on its promise to maintain a high standard of quality for its luxury listings, according to Kristaiana Capati, an adviser with the New York City luxury travel company Artisanal Experiences. “Wealthy travelers today are very much interested in luxury home rentals, but there is not enough product out there to meet their demand,” she said. “Airbnb, being such a known brand, has the potential to significantly change that.” The company is in an advantageous position to do so. Dr. Pandit said that Airbnb has minimal competition in the home rental market, except in certain destinations where it may face competition from local companies. “There's not another company out there, to my knowledge, that is as big,” he said.

By Erin MacLeod Now that the feathers and the sparkles and the high-octane soca music have left the streets of the Trinidadian capital of Port of Spain for another year, what’s left is what is referred to as the feeling of “tabanca.” It’s a post-Carnival malaise that some say is only cured by more bacchanal. Port of Spain may be best known for its exuberant annual Mardi Gras that ended Feb. 13, but even when the Trinidadian capital’s streets are not flooded with costumed revelers, it remains home to a vibrant arts scene. Behind an unassuming middle-class house in the quiet midtown neighborhood of Woodbrook, lies a multifaceted arts center named Alice Yard. The “Yard,” as it is called by locals, is an important hub of contemporary art activity in the city. Soon after walking through its always-open gate on a sunny morning last spring, I met a Scottish artist in residence, Joanna Helfer; a group of people filming boiling sugar as a comment on Trinidad’s colonial past; and others talking and laughing nearby. I complimented one of the women on her jewelry and she immediately showed me an Instagram account for the designer and told me about a range of local pop-up craft fairs where I might find a piece of my own. When neighborhoods like Woodbrook came into being in the 1930s — Nobel Prize-winning writer V.S. Naipaul grew up in the area — the backyards of these houses were where Carnival bands evolved out of community workshops known as “mas camps” (mas being short for masquerade). “Yards have always been part of our narrative, the kind of informal, non-regulated spaces where people have played, lived,” said Christopher Cozier, an artist and co-administrator of Alice Yard, along with the architect Sean Leonard whose grandmother had lived on the property, and the local writer and editor Nicholas Laughlin.  Alice Yard is part of an informal network of similar grass-roots arts organizations across the Caribbean, such as Fresh Milk in Barbados and New Local Space in Jamaica. The administrators of Alice Yard also manage an affiliated sister space, Granderson Lab, in Belmont, the city’s first suburb, initially populated by Afro-Trinidadians in the post-Emancipation 1800s. Granderson Lab, housed in a former family-run printery belonging to Mr. Leonard, is now home to projects that include carnival planning and installation art. The post-bacchanal creativity extends to the literary scene in Port of Spain. Since 2010, Caribbean literature has received an elevated platform with the founding of the Bocas Lit Fest. Held annually in April, the festival is free and showcases some of the best writers in the region.  Literary stars like the Man Booker Prize-winning author Marlon James and up-and-coming writers speak to small audiences and mingle with attendees at a range of events, including workshops. “It is a community that has changed and radically expanded over the past 10 years,” said Mr. Laughlin, who is the literary festival’s programmer. “It feels like there is a bubbling up of talent. Part of it is that, maybe for the first time, writers don’t have to leave Trinidad to make careers for themselves.” The festival also hosts events like poetry slams, screenings and lectures. And there are monthly literary open-mic sessions held at the Big Black Box, another venue that offers a range of artistic and carnival-related activities. Because Port of Spain is relatively small — it has a population of just over 37,000 — it is, according to Mr. Laughlin, “relatively easy to become connected to people.” When I asked about how to find out about other literary events, he simply suggested taking a trip to Paper Based Books, a local shop that specializes in writing from the region. “Just talk to the person behind the counter,” he said. At the Bocas festival last spring, I admired a performance of moko jumbies, stilt walkers that are a traditional feature of Carnival. They were wearing flowing skirts of fabric and strips of newspaper, all carrying protest signs reflecting social justice and environmental concerns, denoting the political element of traditional “mas.” While taking in the towering costumed characters, I ran into the artist and designer Richard Mark Rawlins. He told me about the 1000mokos project, a group that is working to get more people interested in the practice of stilt-walking. He encouraged me to visit an address just across the street from Alice Yard the following Sunday. Arriving at the park I heard the loud rhythms of soca and witnessed Adrian “Daddy Jumbie” Young, a well-known local expert and instructor in stilt-walking, perform flowing movements on sky-high stilts that seemed like magic. His ease and ability to spin, hop and jump while nine feet off the ground was more superhero than human. I thought there was no way I’d be able to do this. But after an hour of encouragement and instruction and lots of soca music, I made it up on a pair of two-foot stilts and walked around a park. I recalled Mr. Cozier talking about Port of Spain’s yards as spaces where people play. He could have been talking about the city itself. Advertisement",5331

And then, both within and beyond the city’s boundaries, there’s the wine: malbecs, torrontés and more. By Nell McShane Wulfhart The reliably clear blue skies of Mendoza, with the Andes lined up in the distance and vines everywhere you look, create driving conditions so perfect the wine can seem almost secondary. To fully explore the area’s wineries, you’ll have to travel south and east of the city to the wine-producing regions of the Uco Valley and Maipu. But making the urban center your base means easier access to night life and great restaurants — the city’s gastronomic scene has been growing in leaps and bounds, along with tasting rooms where you can sample not just the mighty malbec, but other varietals like bonarda and torrontés. It’s tempting to see Mendoza though the bottom of a wine glass, but you’ll be missing out on some spectacular scenery. Pre-emptively burn a few calories with a quick hike up Cerro de la Gloria. The hill’s switchback trail takes just 15 minutes (or you can run up like some fit locals) and ends in a spectacular monument commemorating Gen. José de San Martín, who led Argentina, Peru and Chile in a revolution against Spain. The fabulous views of the city to the east include the stadium; to the west is a sprawling mountain range. The surrounding park is popular with Mendocinos playing soccer and picnicking, and makes a great spot for a walk or run.   Prep your palate for sampling wines at Mendoza’s bodegas (wineries) with a tasting at Wine Not?, in the city center. Despite the cheesy décor — like cork table sculptures and “save water drink wine” signs — the owner Matias Roca specializes in serious and out-of-the-ordinary vintages from small producers; you might get an unlabeled bottle from a garagista (someone who makes wine in their garage) who produces just 1,200 to 1,500 bottles a year; or an unusual chardonnay without mineral notes or too much acidity. Generous pours of five wines are 500 pesos, or about $25.25, and you’re encouraged to take your time.    A local favorite, serving food like your abuela used to make, Fuente y Fonda serves enormous enamel dishes with entrees designed for two, including fresh pastas and a milanesa (breaded steak) topped with melted cheese, fresh tomatoes and ham. The appetizer of beef tongue, sliced thin and doused in olive oil, vinegar and garlic, is meltingly good, and the wine list does justice to Mendoza’s offerings; on a recent visit a blend of malbec, cabernet sauvignon and bonarda from Matías Michelini, a Mendoza wine star, was on offer. Save room for dessert, which is free, and don’t miss the moist, dense bread pudding (budín de pan) if it’s available; it comes with a healthy dollop of dulce de leche. Dinner for two, with wine, around 900 pesos.      Reserve a spot at Bodega la Azul’s 11:30 a.m. tour and tasting before embarking on the stunning drive (about an hour and 15 minutes) down Route 40 to the Uco Valley, where some of the country’s most lauded bodegas grow their grapes. The drive south, with the Andes to your right, showing clear lines of demarcation where the snow stops, and fields of vines on either side, is breathtaking. Arrive at the tiny, charming bodega, which is the only 100 percent Argentine-owned winery in the area. Ezequiel Fadel Hinojosa, the owner and a third-generation winemaker, introduces visitors to his small-production sauvignon blanc (acidic because of the high altitude) and blends of malbec and cabernet sauvignon, with a stop in the small winery at the back where wine is produced in eight steel vats. The sofas in the garden restaurant make the perfect place to sit with a glass when you’re finished. Tour and tasting: 200 pesos.   Just five minutes’ drive up the road brings you to Tupungato Divino, a small hotel with a restaurant and a garden that offers a spectacular view of the Andes, extensive fields and a babbling, man-made irrigating stream that runs right by tables shaded by grape-laden vines. The impressive wine collection of 150 vintages is sourced from nearby wineries, and the seasonal menu is fixed price, with a degustation of starters and desserts. From the list of entrees, opt for the lomo — the steak is served with a malbec reduction and cooked exactly to order; it’s an Argentine classic. Lunch for two, around 1,100 pesos.   Zuccardi is a name to be reckoned with in Argentina; the moniker of the winemaking dynasty appears on bottles in restaurants around the country. Their Valle de Uco winery, which opened in 2016, is a stunner, thanks to the sleek and uber-modern architecture that was designed to emulate the line of the Andes that serves as a backdrop to this state-of-the-art complex (alluvial rock and other native materials went into the building as well). Tastings start at 400 pesos per person and include a tour that goes from vines to vats to a gorgeous tasting room (note the innovative concrete amphorae); a sampling of their most exclusive wines is 1,600 pesos.    Dinners in Argentina are eaten late, so assuage your hunger with a stop at a shabby white food truck with “jamón crudo” inelegantly scrawled along the side. It’s parked by the side of the highway where Route 7 intersects Calle Cobos, in full view of the mountains. The owner bakes yard-long loaves of bread and cures Spanish ham himself; then slices it to order, making salty, flavorful sandwiches (140 pesos) that are the perfect late afternoon snack. Pull up a white plastic chair, open one of the bottles you picked up on the day’s tours, and enjoy the view under the bright blue sky. Mendoza’s liveliest shopping and night-life street is the four-block stretch of Arístides Villanueva that runs from Belgrano to Paso de los Andes. Packed with busy restaurants, shops, cafes and craft beer bars with outdoor seating, this is where you can pick up trendy pieces by Argentine designers and get a sense of local life at the same time. At Cosset, a combination bookshop and clothing boutique, you’ll find jeans and soft knits for women from the trendy Buenos Aires brand Ríe, slinky dresses from Allo Martinez, and chunky jewelry from Cuatromusas as well as art supplies and books on film and graphic novels. Moht has Isabel O. slip-on shoes in colorful patterns and Lazaro handbags. Finally, at Espacio Aristides, pick up a pair of jeans from the hip Argentine label Ay Not Dead.   Reserve a table in advance for dinner at Azafrán, which has some of the city’s most sophisticated food and a wine cellar to match. The six-course tasting menu (1,250 pesos) departs from the usual Argentine fare, with dishes like tender grilled Patagonian prawns accompanied by a cold almond soup, and pork tenderloin with a sweet potato and coffee purée. Service is thoughtful and friendly. Don’t forget the wine pairing (350 pesos), which includes wines from the creative Maal label (which shares an owner with the restaurant) as well as some of the most interesting bottles in Mendoza. Afterward, if you still have room, stroll across the street to Helados Ferruccio Soppelsa, one of the top ice-cream spots in a city that loves the stuff almost as much as wine. Try the vanilla or cherry flavors, both infused with malbec. The sunny courtyard at Bröd, a small bakery with the best medialunas (small croissants) in town, is the ideal place for planning your next winery visits. The laid-back spot has heartier options, too, like poached eggs, house-made granola and sandwiches. Breakfast for two, around 300 pesos. Across the courtyard is Winery (closed on Sundays, but stop by another time), an extensive wine store with entire rooms dedicated to single varietals. If you’ve still got a crevice left in your suitcase for another bottle, buy it here (they’ll also ship bottles for you if you don’t).   The first female winemaker in Argentina, Susana Balbo has her bodega in Luján de Cuyo, a 30-minute drive from the city, and offers an informative tour of the fermentation rooms, which are filled with enormous steel vats, concrete amphorae, and the newfangled, teardrop-shaped barrels the winemaker is experimenting with. The bodega has its own restaurant; post-tour tastings are held in its basement tasting room or an outdoor patio where you’ll be introduced to, among other wines, a bright and fruity torrontés, and Ms. Balbo’s BenMarco Expresivo, a complex blend of malbec and cabernet franc. Tasting, including tour, 260 pesos. Book in advance.   The Club Tapiz restaurant, part of a small hotel, has an elegant dining room where the chef Soledad Nardelli constructs a prix fixe lunch menu of three courses (550 pesos), offering sophisticated platings of vacio (flank steak) slow-cooked in milk; pink trout on a bed of mixed quinoa; and cheeses with house-made marmalade and candied walnuts. The wine list is long and mostly from the Tapiz bodega, which also produces good olive oils (ask the server if you want to sample them). On warm days, dine on the patio in front of the enormous tree that’s home to dozens of noisy parakeets. Centrally situated on the city’s main plaza, Hotel Argentino (Espejo 455; argentino-hotel.com; doubles from $110, including breakfast) has 46 rooms, the most basic of which are small but very clean. There’s a pool in the garden that’s perfect for cooling off after a sunny day among the vines. The Park Hyatt (Chile 1124; mendoza.park.hyatt.com; doubles from $180) has been around for a while but it still gives a lot of bang for your buck, with spacious rooms (ask for a mountain view), its own spa and a wine bar.

By Shivani Vora If you’re headed to Las Vegas, you don’t have to be a high roller to get the biggest bang for your buck, according to Babs Daitch, a travel consultant at Yankee Clipper Travel.  Ms. Daitch resides in Las Vegas and plans frequent trips to the city for her clients. “If you know some insider tips and the deals to watch for, a lavish Vegas trip can be had for a reasonable price,” she said. She shared some of her best tips for a wallet-friendly trip to Vegas that doesn’t skimp on luxury.  First, avoid visiting Las Vegas during citywide conventions. Hotel occupancy is higher, which limits your chances of booking a great room, as are nightly rates for hotel rooms all over the city. Las Vegas Tourism’s official site has a calendar of upcoming conventions you should keep an eye on.  In general, hotel rates are the lowest in July and August because the city’s hot weather keeps the crowds away. “If you love hanging out by the pool, these are great months to visit because many of the resorts have fantastic pools,” Ms. Daitch said. Hotel rates also dip after Thanksgiving weekend through early January. Dinner at many of Las Vegas’s famous restaurants can easily run $150 a person or more. If you’re keen on a meal at one, go during lunch when prices can be more reasonable.  If you prefer to keep your meal options open, or you just want the freedom to try lots of restaurants, buy the Vegas Dining Card from Tix4Tonight. It costs $5 a person for seven days and will save you up to 50 percent at several notable Vegas restaurants including Emeril’s New Orleans Fish House, where you’ll get 20 percent off your food bill, and Planet Hollywood Restaurant and Bar, where you’ll save 50 percent.  Two more dining out tips: First, some restaurants have happy hours with half-priced appetizers. Second, Ms. Daitch enjoys frequenting popular spots at breakfast, when food tends to be the least expensive, yet still freshly prepared and delicious. One of her favorite places for a morning meal is Eggslut at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, which serves creative egg-based sandwiches. “Eating there is a memorable dining experience, but I’m spending only around $10,” she said. Ms. Daitch also suggests breakfast at Thomas Keller’s Bouchon, at The Venetian.  If you’re a gambler, you’re in store for free drinks, Ms. Daitch said. “Vegas casinos serve free drinks to all gamblers, even at penny slots,” she said. In her experience, the Wynn and the Cosmopolitan offer the best free drinks. But fret not nongamblers: you can find drink discounts of up to 50 percent off usual prices at happy hours offered by bars and restaurants all over the city, including many inside the city’s popular resorts. A ticket to one of Vegas’s popular shows can run well into the triple digits, but if you’re open to seeing one last minute, Tix4Tonight lists same-day deals for shows.  The site is updated daily, but a recent example included up to a 50 percent savings on a ticket to the David Copperfield magic show. And, try to avoid seeing the newest and most in-demand shows because these tend to have higher ticket prices, and fewer seating options for groups.  Advertisement",3331
5a8d4368410cf7000162d156,2018-02-21T10:01:02+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/travel/mississippi-river-southern-louisiana-.html,Travel,"If New Orleans is an aging beauty queen drunk on the fumes of her glorious past, Plaquemines Parish, to the southeast, is plain old sloshed — not to mention saturated, striated, slivered and surrounded by water. And no wonder: The peninsula that comprises most of the parish was born many years ago, when the Mississippi River shifted, creating a sliver of land melding into its extensive wetlands. Even on the peninsula itself, things aren’t so solid, not with the Mississippi chugging down its middle at approximately the equivalent of 166 semitrailers of water a second, and the Gulf — flat, blue-brown and dotted with oil rigs — on both its eastern and western flanks. Route 23, the main road in and out, gets you just past Venice, the peninsula’s last town. Go a bit farther on Tidewater Road and you come to the sign that tells you that you have reached the “Gateway to the Gulf,” or “the southernmost point in Louisiana.” If you want to go to the very end, where the river spills out in three different channels (called passes), you have to do it by boat. I did it years ago, albeit on a cruise ship. But on a cruise ship, you don’t really think about how strange the landscape is as the river churns its way to the rim of the continent, where the land is barely land at all, but rather, mere fingers of earth, clumps of marsh, mosquitoes and mist. But when I took the same trip by car, paralleling the river until it could be paralleled no more, I got a fuller view, as if looking at the same picture from both sides of a negative. Despite the immense ships floating by on the far side of the seemingly endless levee, Plaquemines appears to be like many other rural Louisiana parishes: dotted with churches, convenience stores, trailer homes surrounded by tender green fields, sprays of yellow wildflowers, live oaks covered with Spanish moss, vegetable gardens. In the town of Belle Chasse (not far from New Orleans,) there’s Woodlands Trail and Park, a recreational greenway of forested wetlands filled with palmetto and cypress — lovely, yes, but similar in many ways to other such woodlands in the state. So too, there are antebellum plantations, including a handful of privately owned plantation homes in various states of repair (or not). In Braithewaite, Stella Plantation opened in 2012 as an events venue. Woodland Plantation, in West Pointe à la Hache, was built in the 1830s and was for decades dedicated to the propagation of sugar cane and the trading of slaves. It is now operating as a bed-and-breakfast, with five separate buildings for guests, including a raised Creole cottage with numerous guest rooms. Farther on is Fort Jackson, completed in 1832 to defend New Orleans. During the Civil War, it was under Union naval fire for 12 days. It fell on April 28, 1862, after which Union forces captured New Orleans and used the fort as a prison. It’s now a National Historic Landmark and the only one of three historic local forts that — despite having been badly damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, before being re-soaked by Isaac — can be visited by the casual traveler. Dragonflies play in the rushes growing in the fort’s moat, and along the rim, which you can walk or drive along on a series of pathways, you can see that the fort is shaped like a five-pointed snowflake. There are two other forts in the neighborhood. Fort St. Philip is on the river’s east bank, but as it’s privately owned and accessible only by boat or helicopter, it’s a bit hard to visit. Likewise, the circa 1700 site of Fort De La Boulaye — built by early French explorers and now situated on Highway 39, not far from New Orleans — is on private property, and there isn’t much left to see despite its importance to Louisiana’s first European settlers. Plaquemines is an enchanted place, beloved by nature lovers and sportsmen alike, but given its fragility, how long it will remain a place at all — in the sense of a location that signifies firm land — is anyone’s guess. Even so, from its earliest days as a European foothold on the new continent, and on through hurricanes, wars, epidemics and social and economic upheavals, the region hung on. Then the 1927 Mississippi River flood came along, and when the powers-that-be in New Orleans realized that the flood would most likely inundate the entire city unless drastic steps were taken, they dynamited the levee some 13 miles below the city, sparing the Big Easy by funneling the floodwaters into Plaquemines, and, in the process, devastating it. Randy Newman recounted the disaster in his song “Louisiana,” which goes, in part: “The river rose all day, the river rose all night / Some people got lost in the flood / Some people got away all right.” What Mr. Newman doesn’t sing about is how, in the aftermath of the flood, the Army Corps of Engineers was authorized to do what it had to do to prevent future catastrophes, the upshot being that it changed the course of nature, which in turn set in motion a cycle of increasingly more ruinous storms, followed by increasingly more expensive, if unavoidably temporary, fixes. To understand the predicament that Plaquemines is in, you have to go back to prehistory, during which, for thousands of years, the river flooded regularly. Along with flooding, it frequently changed course to find the fastest route to the sea. Because that’s what rivers, left to themselves, do: They flip and flop around, creating river deltas and vast watery networks. These two behaviors — flooding and rerouting — created rich deep loam (as in the Mississippi Delta), and built both the barrier islands and the landmass of South Louisiana itself. It’s a complex story with many moving parts (and many books devoted to explaining it, including the masterful “Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America,” by John M. Barry). But the gist of all this is that after 1928, the river was forced into a vast continuum of regulated levees and straightened, the idea being that the levees would prevent flooding, and the straightening would accommodate shipping. But with the levees keeping the water in, natural land-and-barrier-island-building came to a stop; with the waters rushing on at a faster pace (without natural twists and turns to slow it), silt began to collect in inconvenient places, such as in shipping channels, including in Plaquemines, where the Army Corps regularly dredges. Faster-moving water also means that the river may be more insistent than it would otherwise be about where it wants to go as it wends its way to its final home in the Gulf. Because where it wants to go isn’t where it now goes (past the “big bend” at Baton Rouge, east toward New Orleans, and finally through Plaquemines Parish), but rather, straight down the Atchafalaya River and from there past the town of Morgan City (home of an annual petroleum and shrimp festival) and finally into the Gulf. But since the forces of industry, trade and human settlement demand that the river remain where it is, the Corps built a collective of enormous and costly structures — most notably, the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway — in order to prevent the Atchafalaya from “capturing” and rerouting the Mississippi. But the more the river is tamed and contained, the more the surrounding land sinks — crunching down to ever-thinner layers of earth as, deprived of the natural replenishment of regular flooding, it dries out like an old, brittle sponge. Hence, while New Orleans is, on average, one or two feet below sea level, Plaquemines is literally six feet under. It’s both weird and fragile, this place, which may even be one of the reasons people keep coming here — for its swamp tours (by kayak, air boat and small motorboats), its cypress and tupelo forests, and its wildlife: turtles, bright green frogs, snakes, gators and, of course, its birds. Birds, birds, everywhere, including an abundance of water fowl — snow geese, mottled duck, mallards, shovelers, green-winged teal, pintails, white-fronted geese, not to mention white egrets, blue herons, bald eagles, ibis, pelicans, flycatchers, osprey, kites, falcons, buntings, sandpipers, hummingbirds and gulls. You float under ancient trees, past cypress knees and plants that look like they’ve been there since the time of the dinosaurs. In point of fact, and despite the ubiquity of petrochemical all-stars like Chevron and Baker Hughes, much of the parish is designated as a wildlife refuge, including Breton Island, which, together with the Chandeleur Islands and other barrier islands, comprise the Breton National Wildlife Refuge. Its enthusiasts claim that the fishing in and around Plaquemines is the best anywhere — tuna, dolphin, wahoo, whale shark and marlin in the deep blue seas; redfish, flounder and speckled trout closer in. You can fish in fresh water, salt water, on and offshore. There is fly-fishing, bayou- and swamp-fishing. There are nine marinas and hundreds (if not thousands) of charters and guides. Ducks abound, too, which is why many of the fishing-tour operators also arrange duck-hunting excursions. Me, I neither hunt nor fish, but I do eat, and by the time I pulled into the Venice Marina, with its houseboats and elevated, brightly colored “camps” (small cottages), many available as rentals, it was well past noon. I was hungry. It was a quiet day, too windy to venture out. The boats moored in the marina danced on the current. I stumbled into Crawgator’s Bar & Grill — so far as I could tell, the marina’s sole restaurant — sat on the deck and devoured a platter of fried fish, sweet potato fries and toast, which was served to me by a young woman who, not surprisingly, couldn’t have been nicer or more polite. But that’s South Louisiana for you — the people are warm and friendly, the food is fabulous, and though the whole place could be washed away in a hurricane season or two, it sure as heck knows how to live.",9928

For Pip (a.k.a. Pierre), the prancing was never better. By Susan Saiter Sullivan and N. R. Kleinfield The idea of bringing Pip along on our vacation to France was so we would blend in. Of course we were thinking of him, too. Pip is our dog, a runaway rat terrier we adopted from a shelter. He has leftover anxiety from his past life and we worried that he would be stressed-out in a kennel. But we admit that we had a selfish reason. We wanted to experience France more as temporary residents than obvious tourists. The French cherish dogs. Their high, uncompromising regard for them is pretty much world legend. Dogs are a mainstay of French public life. Almost everywhere the French go, dogs go. When you leave your house, you take your wallet, your keys, your dog. So our notion was that Pip would bestow French cred on us, inspire the French to view us almost as indigenous: a couple of locals. A dog, we figured, could offset a lot of inevitable touristy behavior on our part. (As for language skills, Susan is fluent enough to get through a French dinner party if the discussion doesn’t get too rarefied, while N.R. is still trying to recall his high school lessons.)  There was an issue. While Pip presents a sweet disposition around people (except, for some reason, anyone wearing red sneakers), he barks indiscriminately at other dogs. Lack of confidence, we’ve surmised, a small guy’s bluff. We didn’t want to lead him into restaurants and stores and start rumbles that would cause the French unnecessary emotional trauma. Thus we prepared. We purchased a gizmo known as an anti-bark collar. The way it worked: whenever he barked he would be sprayed in the face with citronella. It helped somewhat, but we felt bad when he scratched his neck in our elevator and got sprayed.  So we enrolled him in a six-session Canine Good Citizen class at the Southampton Animal Shelter in Hampton Bays, N.Y. Unexpectedly, the one dog he was tranquil around was a pit bull named Bundles. Great, but how many pit bulls were we likely to encounter on the Champs-Élysées? As summer wore on, Pip got better. He did not get perfect. There was one other ticklish issue. Pronounced in French, “Pip” translates poorly, to a word vastly inappropriate for proper public discourse. It would be awkward to yell out breezily while on a congested street, “Pip. Pip. Pip.” It is not unknown for the French to call dogs names like Marceau or Quesnel or Xarles. For his time on French soil, Susan suggested Pip should just become Pierre.  Our trip was to Paris for a week, then a few days in Bordeaux, winding up back in Paris. We chose September, when vacationing Parisians would have replenished the city and be ready to greet people who fit in smoothly. Like us and Pip.  Pip strutted onto our Air France plane as if he did this every day, while we toted the canine carrier he was supposed to occupy. To ride in the cabin on Air France, a dog plus carrier must not exceed 17 pounds. Pip made it by ounces, but, then, no one weighed him. He was also required to have a microchip and rabies vaccination, plus the U.S.D.A. needed to sign off on a health certificate. The vet gave us anti-anxiety pills, but Pip nodded off at the first hum of the engines. When he awoke, we were in Paris. At our hotel, the Regina near the Tuileries Garden, the staff was as exceedingly polite to Pip, now traveling as Pierre, as they were to us. A bed and dishes for him were already in the room. A high number of French hotels, including the swankiest, accept dogs. Some impose a fee, as ours did, and allow only small dogs, while any size goes at others. There are hotels that furnish personalized dog tags inscribed with the hotel contact information. One offers a “team of butlers” to take pets for “a special journey.” We didn’t tell Pierre about that one. Light seeped from the day when we went out to catch the pulse of Paris. The streets echoed with car and motorcycle engines. We stopped at a cafe and attached Pierre’s leash to a chair. He plopped down, content to watch the churn of traffic and flurry of passing humanity. Then a Yorkshire sauntered by and Pierre nearly flipped over the table. The fellow diners seemed to find that cute. During subsequent outings, we meandered along the picturesque Seine. We admired the fountains with water sprouting from improbable places at Place de Concorde.  Pierre adapted amazingly. He was alert and curious, knowing from the different smells, sights, language and street sounds that this was a foreign country. Nothing intimidated him — except the swooshing sound of our hotel’s old-fashioned revolving doors.  It became obvious that in Paris, with a dog, you are regarded warmly as a fellow dog-lover or, conversely, not noticed because it’s commonplace. A dog makes you seem local. One afternoon, in fact, we encountered a Frenchwoman walking two small dogs, and she stopped to chat thinking we lived in the neighborhood. To make a birthday celebration memorable, we asked a French friend to call some plush restaurants to check if they minded dogs. He seemed amused that we found this necessary, but humored us. In every instance, the translated reply was, “Your dog is welcome.” One went so far as to say, “It would be our pleasure,” as if we would be doing them a big favor. We weren’t fully prepared, though, for the one we picked, the starchy kind that makes you terrified to even glance at the wrong fork, let alone allows an animal to pass beneath its gold-leaf entrance. Pierre had more composure than we did, prancing in as if he were royalty. At a more relaxed place, where a glass of wine was a mere 5 euros, the waiter assured us that he enjoys serving dogs: “We bring them a bowl of water and mix in a little whiskey.”  A French issue of some concern is dog deposits. For a while, motorized pooper scoopers used to vacuum them up. That ended some years ago — cost pressures. Now you’re supposed to handle the job yourself or fines can reach hundreds of euros.  We packed plenty of plastic bags — Susan’s last Zumba class, instead of granola bars, happened to offer free dispensers full of them — and did our part. Yet it was clear that many French dog owners think otherwise, or else they don’t go to Zumba. Possibly it had to do with a French superstition that stepping in dog poop with your left foot brings good luck.  We understood that dogs can ride the Metro, but to make sure we asked a booth attendant. Uncertain, she ushered us to a giant board containing what seemed like thousands of Metro regulations. Scrolling down with her finger, she found the “les chiens, les animaux” section. Turns out if your dog fits inside a bag, he’s good to go. Bigger dogs need a child-fare ticket.  About the barking. He got better, even with so much public presence, but we had to regularly remind him and carry a tremendous amount of treats to divert him. The good thing is, French dog owners found his behavior comical. Apparently their attitude is that it is much better to have a dog that barks a lot than to not have a dog at all. We went out with Pierre to a perfume shop, because you have to do that in Paris. The chatty man working there, presumably seeking to bond with us, mentioned that a French friend travels back and forth to the United States with her cat. Then he began telling us an extremely elaborate story about the history of a new perfume line and we needed to get going. We stopped at a jammed clothing store, where Pierre embarrassed himself by barking at a dog that turned out to be himself in the mirror. On another day, we drifted into a top art gallery in the Marais district. Pierre seemed as intrigued as we were by a conceptual sculpture that was basically a cluster of large rocks. Or maybe it struck him as a convenient place to lift his leg. It was definitely time to leave really fast. One evening, we met a French friend for drinks. She found it unremarkable that we were with a dog at a bar full of business people and in-the-know Parisians. Before we had even ordered, the waiter set down a dish of water for Pierre. He was especially pleased that the waiter remembered his favorite snack to go with his drink: peanuts. Paris doesn’t accept dogs everywhere humans go, like museums. So Pierre had to miss the Musée de l’Armée, the Musée des Arts Decoratifs and the Louvre. When we had a phone problem, he did tag along to the Apple store in the Louvre Carousel. The limber technician helping us got a kick out of an American dog named Pierre. He waved over several fellow technicians, who clustered around Pierre and fussed over him. We got spectacular service.  Though supermarkets dislike dogs thumping around, when we visited a small one for some snacks the manager said to just tie him up in the front. When we finished shopping, Pierre was cozied up to an Italian man with a florid face and getting a great neck rub. Oddly, dogs are also banned from most Paris parks. Some of the glorious ones, though, like the Tuileries and the Luxembourg Gardens, have designated sections. We noticed pickier ones that besides dogs, forbid drinking alcohol, smoking, kicking soccer balls and visiting during a thunderstorm. Sifting for things to do one languid day, we read that on the outskirts of Paris is one of the world’s oldest pet cemeteries, Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques, dating to 1899. Rin Tin Tin, who, yes indeed, was French, is buried there. Thinking it over, we decided it didn’t seem like something we wanted Pierre to see. Some say the real France lies in the more leisurely and traditional provinces, and so we went to find out. Pip slept through the two-hour, high-speed train trip to Bordeaux, the stately ancient port city southwest of Paris. What attracted us was its cultural history, which traces back not only to its conquest by Caesar Augustus, but to cave-dwellers, its reputation as a gourmet center and, of course, the wine. It turned out Bordeaux was also brimming with dogs, about one for every four residents. It’s even home to a very old French breed, the Dogue de Bordeaux, a hefty mastiff that was the drooling co-star of the Tom Hanks movie “Turner and Hooch.” Our hotel, the Intercontinental, presented Pierre with a bed and the town provided plentiful “Sac-O-Mat” stations for dispensing with “chien déjections.” The parks were canine, as well as human, strolling grounds.  One afternoon, we appropriately had lunch at Le Chien de Pavlov, a bistro on one of the medieval side streets. Maxime Rosselin, the convivial, bespectacled patron, stopped by our table. His docile French bulldog, Denise, was the picture of contentment perched on a sofa between the dining room and bar, where tables were higher. These satisfied those with larger dogs. Pierre, demonstrating insufficient deference, noticed Denise and began barking. Denise simply ignored him. “Ever any barroom scuffles? Canine, that is?” we asked. “Never,” he said. Actually, he added, Denise is beneficial for business. “She’s very good with our favorite customers,” he said. “One often takes Denise for a little walk.”  On a welcome sun-splashed day after a string of moist ones, we visited the impressive Miroir d’Eau reflecting pool, then crossed the Pont de Pierre, the bridge demanded by Napoleon. We read that he fell overboard while on a ship during his escape from Elba. He couldn’t swim and, sure enough, a Newfoundland saved him.  For our waning days in Paris, we stayed on the Left Bank at the Hotel Duc de Saint Simon in the St. Germain-des-Prés district. Pierre got to sample fresh neighborhoods like the Latin Quarter, with its curvy streets. Sometimes you have to draw practical limits, so we didn’t take him with us to the opera. Anyway, his toe pads were a bit scuffed from covering countless French kilometers. We rubbed Vaseline on them and let him rest. Taking our last wistful stroll along the Rue des Peres, Pierre’s tiny-dog prance seemed all the more confident. He sniffed for discarded fragments of croque-monsieurs. People saturated him with endearing smiles, reached to pet him. Pierre had risen to the challenge and applied his training to a novel situation. We found that our bond with him tightened.  We took Pip to France so we would be accepted, and we were. At the same time, the French took Pip into their hearts. Pip took the French into his.

By Shivani Vora There are plenty of tasty reasons to let your appetite determine your destination this year. From festivals celebrating familiar foods to those where you can try more unusual ones, and events where both culinary world superstars and lesser-known chefs cook for the crowds, traveling in the coming year promises to be a palate-pleasing proposition. Perugia, in Italy’s Umbria region, will host the 25th edition of Eurochocolate (Oct. 19 to 28), an event that draws a million people over the course of 10 days. Visitors can try chocolates from more than 100 European producers and also sample chocolate-based desserts prepared by notable pastry chefs, who serve crepes, cookies, cakes and ice cream.  The Espelette Pepper Festival (October) in Espelette, France, situated in the picturesque Basque countryside, is turning 50 this year, and celebrates the end of the espelette pepper harvest. There’s a market where local purveyors sell the pepper as well as other regional products, and restaurants throughout the town have special menus showcasing it.  Australia has no shortage of food festivals, but the second annual Taste of Kakadu (May 18 to 27), in Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, may be the most adventurous. Festivalgoers can discover the bush cuisine that the aboriginal people have eaten for more than 65,000 years — there’s emu, chorizo, barramundi, magpie goose and more. The scheduled group bush walks are the ideal antidote to all the eating.  The Melton Mowbray Food Festival (October) in Leicestershire, England, is happening for the 15th time this year in the namesake’s town historic livestock market. Here, close to 200 purveyors proffer tastes of the region’s top food and drinks, including pork pies, cheeses, fudge and ales. There’s also a street food area where Sri Lankan, Singaporean and other varieties of Asian food can be had. Travelers looking for an excuse for a beach getaway might consider the four-day Caribbean Food & Wine Festival (early November) on Providenciales island in Turks and Caicos. The event, now in its eighth running, pairs celebrity chefs such as Christina Tosi from Momofuku Milk Bar, and Tiffany Derry from “Top Chef” with local talents — the teams work together to create regional dishes like cracked conch and coconut shrimp, which visitors can try at dinners and daytime tastings at venues throughout the island.

By Matt Gross Almost as soon as we landed in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I set out to make my family miserable. This was not difficult. It was late August, nearing 90 degrees and humid. All I had to do was propose we walk through the streets of the former Saigon to a restaurant for lunch. At first, my wife, Jean, and our daughters Sasha, 7½, and Sandy, almost 4, were game. The road outside our Airbnb — an air-conditioned two-bedroom, with tile floors and brick walls, carved into a crusty ocher Art Deco building in central District 1 — was oddly calm. Shade trees spindled past skeins of electrical wire, while the low plastic chairs of an open-air cafe sat neatly in the shade of a long, blank wall. When we came to a busy avenue, we all held hands and stepped bravely into traffic, trusting that motorbikes would swerve around us with unthinking grace. (And they did!) Soon, though, the sun bore down, and we sweated our way along a market street. The rough pavement was at once dusty and damp, the din of shoppers and small trucks inescapable, the ripe scents of fruits and vegetables, fish and pork, as unrestrained as their vivid hues. All about was action, noise, aroma, drama — the kind of whirling vortex of energy I feed on. Not so the ladies. There was whining, dawdling, worry. One child had to be carried. (I bore that burden.) It is entirely possible that someone asked, “Are we there yet?” Finally, after 15 endless minutes, we reached a fluorescent-lit restaurant, Chi Tuyen, where we sat on blue plastic stools at a lightweight metal table and ordered bun thit nuong, nubs of pork grilled to caramelized sweetness, on a tangle of cool rice noodles, shredded lettuce and herbs like mint and perilla. The kids ate and calmed down, and Sandy played adorably with one of the kittens roaming the restaurant. Outside, rain began to fall, harder and harder, and then even harder. We were trapped, but there was nowhere else in the world I wanted to be. Twenty years earlier, almost to the day, I had moved here to live. Vietnam and the United States had only recently re-established diplomatic relations, and I was a fresh college grad embarking on an adult life of adventure in an unknown land. Over the course of a year, I fell in love with the city everyone still called Saigon — with the seething chaos of its streets, the head-spinning variety of its flavors, the boundless outgoing enthusiasm of its people. In a lifetime of constant travel, Vietnam was my first, truest, deepest love. And yet, though I’d been back to visit a dozen times or more since 1997, I’d never brought my wife and kids, primarily because Jean’s family lived in Taiwan, so that island always took precedence on trips to Asia. In the summer of 2016, however, we found ourselves in Taipei for an extended period — long enough, I decided, to make a weeklong trip to Vietnam. First we would hit Ho Chi Minh City, then spend two days at a beach resort near Nha Trang — nothing overly ambitious, just enough for my family to begin to understand the place that made me who I am. Still, I worried: Would the people I love most love the land I love most? How could they not? All around were visceral pleasures. At the entrance to our building sprawled a sidewalk restaurant, and every morning they’d send up breakfast on a tray: bowls of bun bo hue, a spicy beef-and-pork noodle soup, or banh mi op la, fried eggs with baguettes as light as air. From the next-door cafe, I would fetch tall glasses of Vietnamese iced coffee, made from house-roasted beans and thick with condensed milk, plus pastries from Tous Les Jours, a Korean franchise bakery (not my pick, but the kids adored it). We would eat in our cozy little apartment, and I’d sigh with contentment: This was just like my old life here — but now I had people to share it with. From there, we’d venture out to see friends I’d long wanted my wife to meet. We visited Quynh Anh Pham, a thin, elegant video producer — known as QA — who had reinvented herself as Ho Chi Minh City’s premiere modern florist. Her shop and cafe, Padma de Fleur, lay down a still-unfinished alley; its courtyard was draped with dangling mokara orchids, watering cans painted blue and pastel pink, and weathered metal saucer lamps. The lemonades that QA served my daughters came garnished with pale roses, and there was yet another kitten for Sandy to play with. This was classic Saigon — an oasis of sophisticated beauty that a casual visitor might never glimpse. Places like Padma de Fleur felt especially precious when I witnessed the big, obvious changes to the city’s landscape. Like Takashimaya, the glittering, multistory Japanese mall that had just opened in the heart of Saigon, within sight of the Opera House (still lovely, at about 120 years old) and bustling Ben Thanh Market.  It was as fancy a mall as Vietnam has seen, chock-full of international luxury brands (and a Japanese food court!), and it reminded me that back in 1996, there was but one mall, Saigon Superbowl, out near the airport, where country bumpkins would come to gape at, and fearfully attempt to ride, the city’s sole escalator. Now, at Takashimaya, escalators intimidated no one — except for one stylish woman wearing wobbly four-inch heels, who held tightly to the railing as she ascended. The mall felt so utterly normal that I didn’t freak out when Sandy ran off and got lost for 10 minutes — this was no longer the rough-and-tumble city where you’d worry about kidnappers. Every excursion was an opportunity to compare the Vietnam I remembered with the Vietnam it now was, mostly to my delight, occasionally with disappointment. A road along the Ben Nghe Canal, for example, had been widened and landscaped into sunny modernity, but the project had wiped out old buildings, including an auto garage that, at night, turned into a secret shellfish restaurant. Sasha, however, approved. “I like this part of Vietnam,” she said, gazing out the window of our taxi, “because it looks well trained. Nice and clean and it looks good — like it works. The other parts …” She trailed off, and I knew why: Vietnam was not a hit with my family. The heat was rough. (What did they expect during summer in Asia?) They were not fans of the dirt, the chaos, the insects. The kids kvetched about being bored. (Just like at home!) Jean remarked, “I don’t think Southeast Asia is for families.” I didn’t know quite how to take that. For decades, I’d seen foreign families all over Southeast Asia — a major reason I’d wanted to bring my own family here. On the other hand, I understood: Like New York, Ho Chi Minh City exists not for tourists but for its own lively populace; this metropolis doesn't care about coddling outsiders — it’s too busy entertaining itself. So the task of entertaining fell to me. Whenever the heat grew too brutal, we would stop for sinh to, cool fruit shakes — orange, mango, banana, soursop, avocado — sold everywhere from the alleys of the backpacker district to market stalls in Cholon, the city’s Chinatown. We took taxis and Ubers, not motorbikes. We rummaged the racks of Mayhem, a hidden-away vintage clothing store, and emerged with armfuls of finds, including an oversize flutter-sleeve top for Sasha and what Jean described as a “ditsy floral dress” for herself. I couldn’t get over how far the city had progressed: Twenty years ago, used clothes were only for the poor; now you needed a credit card to buy them. Another friend, the Vietnamese-American artist Trong Gia Nguyen, led us through the downtown gallery scene. At Galerie Quynh, which opened in 2003, I gushed over one of Trong’s works, a laser-cut facsimile of a brise-soleil, the sun-shielding patterned screens that you see everywhere in Vietnam, cut to the size of a window or an entire building’s facade. At Dia Projects, Jean and I were entranced by “Fruits, Children & the Cutting,” Mai Hoang’s disturbing, entrancing watercolor renderings of children as fruits — dragonfruit, passionfruit, strawberries — being opened, peeled, dissected. At each stop, Sasha sat on the ground and opened her notebook to draw, engrossed and uncomplaining. Sandy, meanwhile, was kept entertained by Trong’s friend Athésia, a Canadian musician passing through on her way to gigs in Australia. I’m told they discussed “Frozen.” Occasionally, my ladies even entertained themselves. While taking an Uber through Cholon, Jean pointed out a trio of early 20th-century shophouses, slightly decrepit but charming still.  “Is this where ‘The Lover’ was filmed?” she asked excitedly, referring to the 1992 movie based on the Marguerite Duras novel. If she could muster such enthusiasm, maybe my experiment was working? Love might be out of the question, but I’d settle for like. Instead, I got ambivalence. For every grand dinner of grilled pork and sour fish soup with old friends, there was a scary cockroach on some sidewalk. The grassy martini at Hum, a stylish vegetarian restaurant, was addictive, but we couldn’t forget that grim immigration officer who’d stamped us into the country. (“I don’t think he’s happy to see us,” Jean observed.) The kids may have enjoyed making crafts projects at the oddly named Somewhereland — Madam Fatty Fatt, a Colonial-era villa that had been renovated into a Hogwarts-like castle, the kids seemed content to work on crafts projects, like cutting felt into hats and cloaks for wooden witch figurines. (Meanwhile, Jean and I sipped iced coffees.) But this was too chill for Sasha. “When you’re young, you don’t want to sit down and relax,” she insisted. “You want to move!” Which is why, on our last day before flying to the beach, I booked a van to the Cu Chi tunnels, the underground former Viet Cong base, about 90 minutes outside Saigon, that is a major tourist draw. At last, the kids could roam and climb, and gawk at the admirably barbaric traps used to catch enemy soldiers, while I pointed out ponds that were really bomb craters and told them about a war I was born too late to remember firsthand. And, of course, we clambered about in the three-foot-high tunnels, which is any kid’s dream but drew rivers of sweat even from this smaller-than-average American. When we emerged, Sandy (who could stand fully upright in the tunnels) explained: “You ate a lot of dinner — that’s why you didn’t fit in the tunnel. You ate a lot of food — like Anna and Elsa!” Sasha was more succinct: “This place is pretty amazing!” As my heart warmed, I also realized: Oh my god, my kids are … tourists. They like it easy. They like fun. They’re on vacation. What did I expect? One day, perhaps, they’d outgrow easy fun, and want to know how Vietnam turned Dad into Dad, but it didn’t have to be today. Tomorrow we’d be at a pristine beach resort, with a swimming pool and a villa twice the size of our Brooklyn apartment — easy fun for $500 a day. Someday, surely, we would return to Ho Chi Minh City. Maybe not next year, but someday. And then we could all compare the Vietnam we remembered with the Vietnam it would become. For her part, Jean had but a single requirement for our return. “Next time,” she said, “I want to stay somewhere nicer.” Advertisement",11312

By Jada Yuan “You’ve arrived! GIG CITY: Home of the Nation’s Fastest Internet” is the rather unsexy city slogan greeting visitors upon their arrival at the tiny airport in Chattanooga, Tenn. “Gig” refers to the status that Chatt (or Cha or the Nooga, depending on whom you ask) earned in 2010 as the first municipality in the United States to offer one gigabit fiber-optic internet speed to its citizens, and 10 gigabit to businesses that will pay premium prices. That clunky claim to fame has lured many a start-up to the Innovation District in its revitalized downtown. It was also a major factor in earning the city the No. 25 spot on the 52 Places to Go in 2018 list (I’m visiting every destination this year), even if it doesn’t quite sing on a postcard.  When a city’s major selling points are its internet speed and its wood-fired Choo Choo train (a phenomenon in 1880), plus a couple of new hotels, it’s hard to imagine what its character might be. With a midsize population of about 177,000, Chattanooga sits right across the Tennessee border from Georgia, so close that one easily crosses state lines driving around — though the Confederate flags I saw flying high seemed to be concentrated on the Georgia side. Alabama and North Carolina aren’t far, either.  “It’s hard not to feel like you’re on the margins when you live in a market like this,” said Tim Kelly, a local business mogul and chairman of the city’s popular amateur soccer club, which has drawn as many as 18,000 spectators a game. Atlanta, he explained, is a constant brain drain, and Nashville, as the state capital, gets the bulk of the government’s attention and funding. “We’re a little insecure about our sense of place, but I think that makes us that much more intense about it when we find it. Localism and local consciousness are really strong.” What I found over a five-day stay may well be one of the most pleasant and livable cities in America. (That is, once the freezing late-January winds that threatened to blow my car off the road had died down. “I wish you were here in the summer! You’re missing everything!” was a refrain I heard about 15 times a day.) Because Chattanooga is nestled into the ridge-and-valley portion of the Appalachian Mountains and oriented around the Tennessee River, the outdoors — in particular hang gliding, mountain biking, hiking, rock climbing, paddle boarding and kayaking — seem to be a way of life. Locals joke that Chacos, those hiking sandals that strap to your feet, are the city’s official shoe. In winter, people just wear them with socks. I, of course, bought a pair.  A 15-minute drive from downtown, for example, will take you to the top of Lookout Mountain, and its wonderful free park, Sunset Rock, rich in Civil War history. Hikes in the area lead past rifle pits where Confederate soldiers tracked the movement of Union troops on the ground, and then sent out word via communications stations on nearby Signal Mountain. Now, students from the University of Tennessee and canoodling couples of all sexual orientations come nightly to sit on cliffs and watch the Tennessee River Valley turn shades of red and pink.  After a hectic first week on the job in New Orleans, I felt an immediate sense of relief as I drove into town and immediately onto a tranquil brick road stretch of Chattanooga’s Main Street lit up with strings of white lights. Every corner I turned seemed to have an interesting bar, including the impossibly narrow Pickle Barrel; Stir, where bartenders climb ladders to reach top-shelf liquor; and the Flying Squirrel Bar, an eternal hot spot that has a lit-up wooden boat hanging from its ceiling. One actionable upside of being Gig City is that, according to Kelly Shaughnessy, a real estate agent and model I met, the dating scene is pretty good: “Fiber-optics brought start-ups and start-ups brought hipsters, so everywhere you go are 20- to 35-year-olds who are not married, making apps.”  My first hotel, The Dwell, is the city’s only boutique offering and an Art Deco gem. Seija Ojanpera, the owner, spent four months combing vintage shops, Etsy and eBay to find its period-authentic décor, which, along with the colorful patterned wallpaper, is different in every room. “I think it’s important for Chattanooga to have interesting places to go that don’t feel like airport lounges,” she told me. The breakfast room and bar often contain more locals than visitors. I also stayed in the town’s new Westin (nice enough, but didn’t blow me away) and the Choo Choo Hotel, which is far from luxurious, but worth it just because the check-in desk is in the train’s old terminal waiting room, and the rooms are in actual Pullman train cars. Those not in need of lodging can have a similar experience in the newly opened American Draft, the country’s first pour-your-own-beer bar in a refurbished train car.  Most striking, though, is the city’s civic life. A phrase that comes up constantly is “The Chattanooga Way”: a reference to a cooperative get-it-done spirit that includes infusions of private foundation money making revitalization possible. Public art is impressive and everywhere, from the Sculpture Fields at Montague Park to “The Blue Trees,” an ecologically themed installation consisting of rows of trees that the artist Konstantin Dimopoulos has painted a non-harmful ultramarine blue to bring attention to deforestation. Upon my arrival, Farron Kilburn, who studies inequities in nursing at the University of Tennessee, invited me to a potluck at her home in the city’s hip North Shore. There, I met a chunk of the city’s diverse sector of artists and community activists including Josiah Golson, who just published an illustrated poetry book called “The Souls of Free Folk” (partly inspired by W.E.B. DuBois), and Rondell Crier, an artist and youth mentor, who moved to Chatt from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and has never felt compelled to move back. The next night, I joined them for a big group dinner at Taconooga, one of the city’s many Mexican restaurants. (The Guatemalan population is also significant and growing.) During the day, one particularly helpful local, Stephanie Hays — a self-described “boomerang” who has lived in China and India and moved back because she loves the city — treated me to one of the free walking tours she gives in her spare time. I came knowing no one and felt like I’d left with a friend group.  Of course, there’s another side to the techification of cities like Chatt. It was on Ms. Hays’s tour, while visiting The Passage, an interactive riverfront monument to the Trail of Tears, designed by descendants of Cherokees who were forcibly removed from the area, that I glimpsed the tensions that come from rapid growth. Robert Stoudemire, a fisherman, told me he’s felt left behind in a city that’s experiencing what’s known as “reverse of flight,” in which legacy black families are moving to the suburbs to make way for new arrivals who can pay higher rents. Chattanooga has the seventh-fastest-growing rent in the nation and a poverty rate well above the national average. A 2016 study shows that its local banks are rejecting black families for home loans at an alarmingly high rate compared with white and Latino families. (The two main local banks approved just one conventional home loan each for a black family in the four years between 2011 and 2014.) “They should’ve left it like it is instead of building all these houses, destroying everything, keeping people from fishing down here,” Mr. Stoudemire said. “They just done messed this world up.” Still, he said, “I’ve been here all my life, ain’t going nowhere till the man take me.” Elsewhere downtown, one high-tech building stands across from a once-grand hotel that’s been turned into government housing.  A Chilean nonprofit worker I met at the potluck, Daniela Peterson, said that she spent her first year in Chatt riding the bus to work, “and people acted like I was a prostitute, because there’s no one else who’s waiting on the corner.” (In a 2012 Brookings Institute study, the city ranked lowest in the country in access to public transportation.) There are also certain spots of the booming Southside area where the stench from a Pilgrim’s Pride chicken-processing plant on Market Street is downright offensive. As a city in mid-transformation, Chattanooga seems to be going through its awkward phase, somewhere between trying out vegetarianism and applying for college.  Every time I go to a new place, I play a game where I ask myself if I could live there rather than New York City. The answer is usually no, but Chattanooga surprised me. For all its contradictions, every day I was there, I liked the city more: the views, the people, the phenomenal coffee shops — even the internet, which proved to be life-changing (in 40 minutes I uploaded 1,000 photos that had been stuck in my queue for days).  “If you stay around, you’ll move down here,” Gene Faulkner, a retired 89-year-old cemetery owner, said when we spoke near his wife’s grave. “We invite all you Yankees, baby! Bring your money. Stay down in Dixie. You cross the Mason-Dixon line, you’ll never go back.”  Jada Yuan will be traveling to each and every place on this year’s 52 Places to Go list.

By John L. Dorman The luxury hotel market, once concentrated in only the largest cities, has surged over the last decade. Jay Stein, the chief executive at the Dream Hotel Group, has taken advantage of the demand, shining a light on a company that helped cultivate one of the most popular trends in modern upscale lodging. “We started the rooftop bar craze,” Mr. Stein said, referring to the 2003 opening of the former Ava Lounge at the Dream Midtown that brought a certain hipness to the usual outdoor drinks scene. “There were others that started to catch on, but we’ve been an early player with luxury boutique hotels.” The company, which includes the Chatwal New York and Time Hotels, currently operates 18 properties. There are plans for 30 additional hotels internationally over the next four years, from a Dream hotel in Belize to boutique-oriented Unscripted hotels in Birmingham, England, and Tulum, Mexico. Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Stein in Manhattan. How has Dream influenced the growth within the New York luxury market? What changes have you seen in this market over the last five years? In the 1960s and 70s, a lot of hotels were boxy and didn’t differentiate themselves. That wouldn’t work today. The increased competition in the New York market over the last few years, with new hotels like the Baccarat Hotel, has forced everyone to look at what they’re doing and really perform everything well. There is more of a hip, cool trend at many hotels, blending lifestyle and luxury. With the growth of boutique hotels, what factors are considered when determining how a Dream property would fit into a particular market, especially midsize cities? We analyze profitability and perform our own research to see if a market is viable. In places like Durham, N.C., and Nashville, there is a demand for more lifestyle hotels, which would have not have been the case a decade ago. People are a lot more exposed to the world than they used to be.  The Dream Downtown New York hotel opened in the former National Maritime Union Building, a 1960s-era concrete structure with porthole windows and a glass-bottomed pool that sits over the lobby. What went into creating and preserving the property? The building (355 West 16th Street) had some challenges since it was inside the block, to the east of the Maritime Hotel. I met with Handel Architects and we took a look at the building, adding a second tower, new porthole windows and a volleyball area with sand. The stainless steel cladding defines the exterior of the building. You’re planning to open two hotels in the Dominican Republic. Are you looking at other parts of the region? The Caribbean is a new market for us, and Belize is one of the fastest growing tourist areas in the region. We have plans for two new hotels in Belize, an Unscripted hotel in late 2018 and a Dream hotel in 2020. What has been your most memorable hotel opening? At the Dream Downtown, we were painting the baseboards minutes before the opening. We were hosting a hospitality conference, so we were committed to opening on time. The hotel has 315 rooms and there were about 300 industry professionals at the conference, and we pulled it off. When you visualize an ideal vacation, what comes to mind? Do you have a favorite destination? Winter in the Green Mountains of Vermont is my favorite. I’m an avid skier, and seeing the covered bridges and mountains near Sugarbush [Resort], Jay Peak, Stowe and Killington is great. Going out to a hot tub with three feet of snow is the ultimate vacation. You recently opened the first Unscripted hotel, Unscripted Durham, in North Carolina. The property, a former 1960s-era motor lodge, was turned into a 74-room boutique hotel. What is your vision for the Unscripted brand? We’re focused on secondary and tertiary markets where there aren’t a lot of boutique options and where we can offer a great lifestyle product. Roughly 10 miles from downtown Austin, we’re planning a hotel that will be attached to a live music venue. Advertisement",4233

By Elaine Glusac The coral reefs around the Turks & Caicos Islands are a major tourist attraction, and Mark Parrish is trying to make sure the visitors he takes there don’t kill them with cosmetics. He co-owns Big Blue Unlimited, a tour operation that guides snorkeling, kayaking and other adventurous excursions around the islands. The company’s website states that, “Big Blue will ONLY ALLOW the use of 100 percent biodegradable sunscreen on all of our trips. Non-biodegradable sunscreen IS NOT TO BE USED on Big Blue trips.” “We make it mandatory, which is easier said than done,” said Mr. Parrish. “The key is telling people well in advance, putting it on the website and saying this is our policy and giving them a chance to shop at home.” After decades of learning that sunblock is vital to a healthy beach vacation, consumers may wonder what’s wrong with their Coppertone. But recent studies that link the active ingredients in protecting skin from damaging ultraviolet rays to coral bleaching has led to a global push for more reef-safe sunscreens. Chemicals in sunscreen that come off while swimming or travel through sewage systems when washed off in the shower are “bigger than climate change,” in causing coral reef damage, according to Craig Downs, the executive director of the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory based in Clifford, Va., which has studied the effects of sunscreen on coral reefs. In 2015, Mr. Downs led a team that reported that oxybenzone, a common chemical found in sunscreens, is toxic to the symbiotic algae that live within corals, which provides their color and performs other vital duties, and also stunts the growth of corals. A 2008 European study published by Environmental Health Perspectives concluded that sunscreen promotes viral infection in corals that can lead to bleaching. They estimated that up to 14,000 tons of sunscreen is deposited in the world’s oceans each year. Last year, lawmakers at the state and county levels in Hawaii unsuccessfully proposed legislation to ban sunscreens containing oxybenzone. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade association representing makers of over-the-counter medicine, and the Personal Care Products Council, representing the cosmetics and personal care industries, oppose the ban, arguing that sunscreen saves lives by preventing cancer. “The proposed sunscreen bans in Hawaii avoid the real causes of coral decline according to scientists from around the world: global warming, agricultural runoff, sewage and overfishing,” the groups noted in a joint statement. While environmental advocates continue to push for legislation, the travel industry, both in Hawaii and beyond, has responded with grass-roots campaigns designed to educate travelers on how to protect themselves from sunburn without contributing chemicals to the reefs.  Aqua-Aston Hospitality, which manages over 40 resorts in the Hawaiian Islands, distributes information on oxybenzone and its role in coral bleaching as guests check in along with a sample of chemical-free sunscreen from Raw Elements considered “reef-safe.” It also stocks free sunscreen dispensers with the biodegradable lotion. The campaign began last April at 16 island locations and is being expanded to all of the company’s resorts, including those in Florida, Lake Tahoe and Costa Rica this year. In March, the company will begin distributing complimentary kits including a bottle of the sunscreen to guests who book using the promo code ALIST. “Everybody wants to do the right thing, they’re just not aware they might be contributing to coral bleaching,” said Theresa van Greunen, Aqua-Aston’s spokeswoman who oversees corporate social responsibility. Outrigger Resorts in Hawaii also provides free samples of reef-safe sunscreen to guests. It has used All Good products, which rely on the mineral-based sunblock zinc oxide, in the past and plans to debut its own Ozone line of environmentally friendly sunscreen this year. In Mexico, areas popular with snorkelers such as Xel-Há on the Rivera Maya and Chankanaab Beach Adventure Park in Cozumel ban the use of non-biodegradable sunscreen. At Xel-Há, visitors with unapproved sunscreen can swap their brands for samples of safe products and get their own back when they exit the park. Resorts are helping spread the word. At the seven Solmar Hotels & Resorts in Los Cabos, guests may purchase biodegradable sunblock on-site and are advised in advance that it is the only kind permitted in area preserves such as Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park. Screening sunscreen for environmental friendliness requires getting familiar with chemicals including oxybenzone, octinoxate and methyl paraben. Haereticus Environmental Lab publishes a list of chemicals to avoid. Mineral sunblocks including zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that are “non-nano” in size are considered safe. Formulations below 100 nanometers are considered nano and can be ingested by corals. Researchers agree that sunscreen isn’t the only culprit in coral bleaching, pointing to rising sea temperatures caused by global warming among other threats. But it may be the one travelers have the most immediate and direct influence over. “This is one impact that we can control,” said R. Scott Winters, the chief executive officer of the Coral Restoration Foundation, a nonprofit conservation organization based in Tavernier, Fla. “If we are to be successful in bringing coral reefs back to a healthy state, it is incredibly important that people visiting them choose sunscreens that do not contain oxybenzone. More important, choosing to cover up with UV protective clothing, rash guards, and hats can also reduce the amount of sunscreen needed.” Sun protection clothing from lines including Patagonia, Coolibar and REI are rated with UPF, or Ultraviolet Protection Factor, figures in the same way that sunscreens use SPF, Sun Protection Factor, numbers. Clothing is considered as effective as sunscreen, said Dr. Henry W. Lim, the president of the American Academy of Dermatology. “The challenge is it doesn’t cover 100 percent of the body’s surface,” he said. For reef specialists like Mr. Downs, less is more. “For a woman in a bikini,” he said, “85 percent of her body will be covered in sunscreen. She can reduce that by 50 percent just by wearing sun shirt. That’s progress.” Advertisement",6528

By John L. Dorman There’s one thing that has a remarkable way of connecting people from different cultures and backgrounds: music. In “America’s Musical Journey,” a 3-D documentary film narrated by the actor Morgan Freeman and hosted onscreen by the singer-songwriter Aloe Blacc, the musical spirit of the country is explored through Mr. Blacc’s excursions to New York, New Orleans, Chicago, Nashville, Detroit and Miami. In the 40-minute film, which premiered at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum in Washington last week and will expand to theaters around the country and abroad, his trips tell the story of how jazz, country, blues, soul and rock 'n' roll melded to fuel American creativity. Before a recent screening at an IMAX theater in Manhattan, Mr. Blacc’s enthusiasm for the project was obvious.  “I always wanted to be a movie star,” he said in an interview. “Traveling across and country and engaging with people gave me the opportunity to learn more about music. It was a no-brainer to want to do this.” The film, which was produced by independent distributor MacGillivray Freeman Films, in association with Brand USA, provides stunning views of the Chicago skyline, steamboats on the Mississippi River in New Orleans and Beale Street in Memphis. But Mr. Blacc said he was surprised by what he learned about these places and the lives of many of the native musicians. “I knew that Elvis Presley had long been influenced by black music, but I wasn’t aware of his engagement with gospel music,” he said. “I learned about how early folk music from Appalachia influenced country and bluegrass music.” The Louis Armstrong House Museum, in Corona, Queens, is a prominent stop in the film. Mr. Blacc sits on the front steps with a group of children and sings his own version of “What a Wonderful World,” Mr. Armstrong’s 1967 hit. In the film’s narration, Mr. Freeman details the sting of racism that Mr. Armstrong endured as an African-American man, noting that early in his career, he wasn’t permitted to stay at the many of the same hotels where he was performing because of his race. In many Southern locales, he slept overnight in vehicles, along with members of his band. Although Mr. Armstrong eventually became an international sensation, the earlier chapter in his life was a reminder of the pangs of discrimination. New Orleans is the site of some of the film’s most festive scenes, with Mr. Blacc and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” bandleader Jon Batiste walking in and around the city’s French Quarter, and joining a second line, a brass band parade.  “The rhythms in the second line are infectious,” Mr. Blacc said. “They just add that flavor to the music.” The city’s vibrancy is evident through its French Creole influences and its jubilant music.  In Memphis, Mr. Blacc takes in the blues scene and eats in Mr. Presley’s favorite booth at the Arcade restaurant on South Main Street. At Arcade, which opened in 1919 as one of the city’s first cafes, a dance routine breaks out, and everyone, from the staff to the patrons to Mr. Blacc, is swept along. Mr. Blacc then makes a trip to Graceland, Mr. Presley’s estate, and learns more about the musician’s life and sees the almost-endless procession of plaques on the wall. The trip to Nashville focuses on its rich country scene. Mr. Blacc visited the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the Grand Ole Opry and Fisk University. At Fisk, which was founded in 1866 and played a vital role in the education of freed slaves and other African-Americans, Mr. Blacc finds musical inspiration with the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a collegiate a cappella choir that first organized in 1871. In Chicago, Mr. Blacc spends time with the jazz pianist and native Ramsey Lewis, who has recorded over 80 albums during his career and is known for songs like “The In Crowd” and “Sun Goddess.” It is a career that Mr. Blacc said he deeply admires. “Maurice White was the drummer for Ramsey Lewis,” Mr. Blacc said in the interview, referring to the founder of the band Earth, Wind and Fire. “Ramsey was probably one of the most important factors in the creation of Earth, Wind and Fire, which is one of my favorite bands. It’s a special story to me.” Mr. Blacc then joins a flash mob in Millennium Park, singing along to the Avicii hit “Wake Me Up,” which he co-wrote.  In Detroit, the birthplace of Motown Records, Mr. Blacc pays homage to the city’s legacy of rhythm and blues, soul and jazz when he visits Hitsville U.S.A., the record label’s former headquarters and now the Motown Museum. Miami, a center of salsa and electronica music, is a natural destination in the film. As the son of Panamanian immigrants, Mr. Blacc told me, he feels a deep connection to the Latin-inflected music that permeates the city, as it reflects the diversity of his Central American roots. He also met Gloria and Emilio Estefan, who were at the forefront of the Miami music scene in the 1980s and much of the 1990s, with a personal story that Mr. Blacc clearly respects. “They came here with nothing and had a bold, beautiful American story,” he said. “America’s Musical Journey” is currently showing at select IMAX and large-format screen theaters. Additional cities in the United States and abroad will feature the film over the duration of the year. The running time is 40 minutes. Follow John L. Dorman on Twitter: @jon425. Advertisement",5601

Don’t miss the bar — or the boat tour. By Alyson Krueger From 295 euros a night (about $362) This 225-room hotel is comprised of 25 connecting canal houses built by wealthy merchants and aristocrats 400 years ago during the Dutch Golden Age. The five-star hotel was originally owned by Peter Pulitzer, whose grandfather Joseph established the Pulitzer Prizes. It had a head-to-toe refurbishment in 2016 and is now a social hot spot. The public spaces — the bar, the courtyard garden, the restaurant — are full of good-looking locals and tourists. The hotel owners care deeply about its past, and there are reminders of it everywhere. The venues are named after historical characters, and signs in guest rooms tell you who lived there throughout the centuries. The Pulitzer Amsterdam is nestled between two of the city’s peaceful canals. My room overlooked a waterway and had a private balcony for watching the riverboats and bikers. Big tourist attractions like the Anne Frank House and the Rijksmuseum are a few minutes away, and colorful signs by the elevator suggest nearby sites to visit. The hotel is in the Nine Streets, a neighborhood full of quirky shops, bars and cafes. You can buy anything from old violins to vintage clothes to bow ties just outside the hotel. In the Pulitzer Amsterdam, no two rooms are the same. I stayed in an airy, modern room with floor-to-ceiling windows, pastel-colored furniture, and a chandelier. The room had so many amenities, I kept discovering more in drawers and closets throughout my stay. There was local coffee and tea, a sewing and shoe shining kit, branded stationery, even complimentary stroopwafels (the popular cookie). There wasn’t the one thing I really wanted: a full-length mirror. And I never received turndown service, which I expected at a five-star hotel. The bathroom was spacious and new (the countertops looked as if they had never been used). There was a deep bath tub and a rain shower with great pressure. The shampoo, conditioner and shower gel was made for the Pulitzer Amsterdam by upscale New York City perfumery Le Labo. I liked the products but would have liked them to be local. The hotel has a two-story gym with up-to-date equipment, a library, an outdoor garden with four swings, even an in-house flower shop. The best amenity by far is the concierge team, which has extensive local knowledge. After check-in a concierge will walk you to your room and give you an overview of the hotel and recommendations about what you should do during your time in Amsterdam. I emailed the team when I was walking around the city with a question, and they responded within minutes. The hotel has exclusive walking and canal boat tours for its guests. The latter takes place on a classic salon boat from 1909 — the captain said that Winston Churchill rode on it in 1946 — and it has polished teak and brass, marble, leather, even carpeting. It’s worth staying in the hotel just for this. The captain handed me a glass of wine and took me and the other guests on a lively and informative water tour of the city. He knew everything from where John Adams lived when he was an ambassador to the Netherlands to where Justin Bieber likes to party when he’s in town. It felt like a steal for 38 euros a person. Jansz is an airy, elegant restaurant. The menu is eclectic and combines specialties from countries across Europe. For an extra charge (29.50 euros per person), hotel guests can have breakfast here. You get to choose a hot dish off the menu as well as help yourself to a buffet of fruits, cheeses and danishes. The soft music in the background and the abundance of light made it a cheerful and relaxing place to start the day. For dinner I sat at the hotel’s bar, The Pulitzer, which looks like it belongs in the 1930s with wood paneling, deep couches and tables tucked in secret corners. The attentive bartender made me a pineapple old-fashioned, a signature drink, and recommended snacks to order. I was surprised by how friendly the place was; I chatted with locals and other travelers and stayed out longer than I had anticipated. The hotel is still in its early stages, and it will be interesting to see if it can keep up its allure. For now, though, it’s a bold place with character, great service, and fun and unexpected touches. Staying there exposed me to different sides of Amsterdam’s culture, history, charm and people than I would have otherwise seen.

By Geraldine Fabrikant Although many tourists flock to Florida for its glorious palette of white beaches, blue-gray waters and yellow sun, the state is also home to lush and exotic gardens in every shade of green. Some were the dream of horticulturists obsessed with collecting plants from around the world that would flourish in their new home. Others were established by immigrants grateful for the opportunities the United States had afforded them and eager to leave a legacy in their adopted country. Still more gardens were the creations of wealthy transplants who, while wintering in Florida, sought to recreate the gardens they loved elsewhere. With enormous resources they hired some of the nation’s landscape architects to design gardens that are as dazzling as any in the country. Here are six of Florida’s most enticing green oases.  An orchid lover’s delight: bucket orchids, sabralia orchids and miniature orchids, a rainbow of colors in their petals. The 15-acre garden, on Sarasota Bay, was established in 1971 as the only botanical garden in the world focused solely on the study of epiphytes, which include many orchid species. (There are 25,000 known types of orchids in the world of which the vast majority are epiphytes: plants that grow on other plants rather than in the soil so that they are closer to the sun.) This garden was once the property of Marie and William Selby (he made his fortune with the Selby Oil and Gas Company, which merged with Texaco in 1948). After Marie Selby died in 1971, leaving the property to the city, a board of directors consulted with experts from New York Botanical Garden and the University of Florida and chose to make the garden distinctive by focusing on epiphytes.  Beyond the profusion of yellow, purple, orange and white orchids, the garden offers a collection of bromeliads from pineapples to Spanish moss; a stunning collection of palm trees, from the Puerto Rican Hat Palm to the Haitian Zombie Palm; and a mangrove walkway that borders Sarasota Bay.  Selby, taking a page from the New York Botanical Garden, has begun mounting an annual exhibition of art inspired by flowers. Last year it was Marc Chagall’s work that led Selby to replant parts of its gardens with salvia and date palms, evocative of the south of France where the artist did some of his loveliest work. This month, four of Andy Warhol’s silk screens of flowers will form the centerpiece of the Selby exhibit “Warhol: Flowers in the Factory.” 900 South Palm Avenue, Sarasota, Fla., selby.org. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day except Christmas. The land for Delray Beach’s Morikami Garden was the gift of the Japanese immigrant George Morikami, a successful farmer who in the mid-1970s donated 200 acres to Palm Beach County. That land now features six discrete gardens created by the designer Hoichu Kurisu, whose credits include the Anderson Japanese Gardens in Rockford, Ill. His vision in Florida was inspired by gardens in Japan; each of Morikami’s six gardens reflects a style from a different epoch, beginning with the 9th century.  In Mr. Kurisu’s words, which are featured on the park’s website, the intention is for visitors “to lay aside the chaos of a troubled world.” He has accomplished that with the use of small lakes and paths that wind among pine forests, bamboo groves and rock arrangements throughout the gardens. The gardens at Morikami are informed as much by religion as by plant life.  With its two landscaped islands joined by a bridge, Morikami’s Shinden Garden was inspired by the gardens that were adapted for the estates of Japanese nobles from Chinese garden design. The Shinden style was popular from the 9th to the 12th century. The park’s Paradise Garden has paths for strolling the perimeters of its two small lakes in a style that recalls gardens that appealed to the new Samurai class of the 13th century.  In Morikami’s Early Rock Garden, rocks are set vertically and spaced to suggest a waterfall — an arrangement that reflects the rise of Zen and its asceticism. Karesansui Late Garden features rocks that are artfully placed on expanses of gravel. That style — karesansui means dry landscape — was meant to serve as an aid to meditation from within a temple.  400 Morikami Park Road, Delray Beach, Fla., morikami.org. Open Tuesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed on major holidays.  What do towering bamboos, crepe myrtle, jack fruit banyan trees, orange bromeliads and bougainvillea have in common? They all thrive in ecosystems between the 26th parallel north and the 26th parallel south. Specifically, at the Naples Botanical Gardens, where the landscape designers include the Miami-based Raymond Jungles, known for his exuberant tropical gardens.  Next to the cool, elegant Lea Asian Garden with a replica of a Javanese temple ruin is the rollicking Kapnick Brazilian Garden: Mr. Jungles’s tribute to his mentor, the celebrated Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx, who died in 1994. (Marx was honored during the closing ceremony at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.) The centerpiece of the Brazilian garden is a mosaic by Marx; bromeliads in pink, purple, yellow and orange mirror his colors. The Caribbean Kapnick Garden, designed by Bob Truskowski, has a laid-back vibe: Among the lush mango and banana trees are hammocks, a cottage and a bocce court that help transport you to island time. The Scott Florida Garden is notable for its bougainvillea and a date palm with a triple trunk. Last year the Naples Botanical Gardens, which opened in 2009, became the youngest to win the Garden of Excellence award from the American Public Gardens Association.  4820 Bayshore Drive, Naples, Fla., naplesgarden.org. Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day except Tuesday, when it opens at 8 a.m. A Dutch immigrant proud of his success in the United States as publisher of Ladies’ Home Journal and 1921 Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “The Americanization of Edward Bok,” Mr. Bok’s American Foundation bought roughly 53 acres in the early 1920s to create a bird sanctuary, then added a carillon tower and gardens. Over the years the property, which opened in 1929, has grown to 300 acres. Its 205-foot-high neo-Gothic Singing Tower dominates the park. Made partially from local stone, the tower houses a 60-bell carillon that is played twice daily.  Mr. Bok’s passion for color is evident in the 50 Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.-designed acres that are the core of Bok Tower Gardens. Filled with azaleas, camellias and magnolia, they are particularly lovely in February and March when they are in bloom.  Because Bok is farther north than the gardens around Miami and Sarasota, it is cool enough at night for these plants to survive. As a result, the look and feel of Bok is far less tropical than many other gardens in Florida.  But these are not the only pleasures of Bok. There also are the Hammock Hollow Children’s Garden and the Edible Garden and Outdoor Kitchen for cooking demonstrations. The Edible Garden is surrounded by peach trees, pomegranate shrubs, fig trees, passion fruit vines and banana trees. The gardens also include acres of palms, oaks and wildflowers that give a visitor a sense of the diversity of Florida’s plant life. To ensure that suburban development does not mar the vistas from Bok, the park has been purchasing adjacent land in recent years.  1151 Tower Boulevard, Lake Wales, Fla., boktowergardens.org. Open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. all year.   The glories of great French and Italian gardens have been recreated at Miami’s Vizcaya, once the home of the International Harvester executive James Deering.  Vizcaya’s grounds were the brainchild of Diego Suarez, the landscape architect who began his career in the early 1900s collaborating with Arthur Acton, the English expatriate and art collector, to help restore La Pietra, the Acton villa near Florence. Suarez became enamored of the elaborate stone work, statuary, fountains with soaring sprays and rills that gave Italian gardens of the 18th century both elegance and fantastical whimsy.  Vizcaya’s grounds were built on fill that had once been a mangrove swamp, now held back by a retaining wall. On level land Suarez created French-style parterres: formal gardens of neatly trimmed plant beds that are laid out in symmetrical patterns with paths for walking.  The Fountain Garden includes a plaza with a fountain from the Italian town of Sutri, which once provided water for its residents. Amid the strangler figs and oaks dripping with Spanish moss, Suarez added a two-story “Secret Garden,” as it is now known, where succulents and cactus flowers bloom in pots built into the stucco walls.  3251 South Miami Avenue, Miami. vizcaya.org. Open 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. every day except Tuesday. Closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Fairchild, in Coral Gables, has a vast collection of tropical plants that were initially gathered from around the world by David Fairchild, a well-known plant collector. When his friend Robert Montgomery, a retired accountant and also a plant enthusiast, opened the 83-acre park in 1938, it was named for Mr. Fairchild. The garden includes the stunning Lin Lougheed Spiny Forest of Madagascar, named for the art collector and donor. Because Fairchild is at the same latitude as that country, it is able to nurture the spiny octopus trees, swollen baobabs, cactuses and desert roses found on the world’s fourth largest island.  Fairchild also has a butterfly conservatory, housed in the Paul and Swanee DiMare Science Village, which includes a metamorphosis laboratory where visitors can watch butterflies emerge from their chrysalises. Twice daily the staff releases butterflies into the conservatory; visitors may find several sitting quietly on their arms. Fairchild’s William F. Whitman Tropical Fruit Pavilion, named for a rare fruit collector and garden benefactor, offers everything from jackfruit vines to miracle fruit. It also boasts mangosteens, a favorite of David Fairchild’s, according to Carl Lewis, the garden’s director. The fruit’s appeal was not lost on Rudyard Kipling, who wrote in 1902: “You’ll know what my riddle means/ When you’ve eaten mangosteens.”  10901 Old Cutler Road, Coral Gables, Fla., fairchildgarden.org.

5a86abd4410cf7000162c4e5,2018-02-16T10:00:42+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/travel/yoga-retreat-india.html,Travel,"Motoring along the mouth of the Aghanashini River, our torsos stuffed inside bulky, bright-orange life jackets, we passed a fishing village and a patch of sandy shoreline called Paradise beach. “There! There!” shouted a woman from the back of the skiff, pointing to a dolphin she spotted in the distance. Our young local captain cut the motor. Watching, we waited in silence. And when our group’s yoga teacher, Larissa Carlson, began to chant the sound of om — a Sanskrit word symbolizing the union of body, speech and mind — and the rest of us joined in, creating a collective, continuous round of the humming syllable. As if awakened by the vibrations of our call, a pod of dolphins emerged, leaping through the air, one after another. This, I thought, is going to be an unusual journey. While a trip to India had been on my bucket list for years, it didn’t seem imminent. But then, strewn on the mudroom floor where the mail makes its way daily through a rectangular slot, I came across the fall 2016 catalog for the Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health. Flipping through its pages, I stopped abruptly on page 20 when I saw the words: “Kripalu in India.” A nonprofit yoga and wellness center in Lenox, Mass., Kripalu, now in its 40th year, hosts nearly 50,000 guests a year who come for its wide variety of programs. Over the past decade, I’ve been an occasional Kripalu visitor, attending writing workshops, yoga classes and several courses connected to my training as a life coach. Standing in my kitchen with catalog in hand, I suddenly began to imagine myself as one of Kripalu’s first guests to experience its mission of “whole-person education for body, mind, heart and spirit” away from its Berkshires home. Last May, along with my 23-year-old daughter, Nicole, I traveled to India for a week of yoga, meditation and ayurveda, an ancient Indian medical system aimed at keeping the body and mind balanced and healthy. We spent our first night at the Alila Diwa hotel in Goa. Set among rice paddies and coconut groves, the infinity pool was ideal for cooling off in the intense heat — summer in India lasts from April to June, and humidity is high in the south, with temperatures in the mid-90s. Early the next morning, we met our group under a giant banyan tree for introductions and gentle yoga, led by Ms. Carlson, a Kripalu yoga teacher and former dean of its ayurvedic school. Our group consisted of 14 guests — 13 women, ranging in age from 23 to 82, and Ms. Carlson’s fiancé, David Lipsius, who, as the former Kripalu chief executive, was involved in the early planning stages of the retreat. Each of us had traveled to India for our own reasons. Taking a break from stressful lives. Learning about ancient health practices. Connecting to our breath and body through meditation and yoga. Because she was between jobs and her mother had invited her, in Nicole’s case. My initial purpose for joining this trip was to discover and explore the only place where practicing meditation and seeking balance may be as common as cellphone use. But this trip took on a new meaning and significance after the sudden passing of my brother three weeks before our departure. On this retreat, I found a space to grieve, a connection to human kindness and a deepening appreciation for self-care — body, mind and spirit — in a safe, nurturing environment. A three-hour bus ride — which involved an adventurous pit stop in an elderly woman’s stone outhouse — led us to our home for the next six days, the SwaSwara resort in Gokarna on India’s southwestern coast. As we approached the hotel, our travel guides, Kyra Sudofsky, of the United States-based Academic Travel Abroad agency, and Sandeep (Sandy) Minhas Singh of the India-based Worldwide Adventures, asked us to fill out a three-page self-assessment chart. Munching on giant cashews, I circled my answers to a battery of questions, covering habits and characteristics ranging from taste preferences and skin temperature to sleep patterns and vein prominence. Each response fell into one of three columns labeled vata, pitta and kapha. We handed our questionnaires back to Ms. Sudofsky and Mr. Minhas Singh, who announced that along with three body treatments, our retreat included a consultation with an ayurvedic doctor. The doctor would be tailoring our treatments after identifying our dosha — the Sanskrit term used for a person’s biological constitution, which is made up of a combination of elements: vata (air and ether), pitta (fire and water) and kapha (earth and water). Nicole and I checked into our room, one of 24 clustered Konkan villas made with local laterite stone, clay tiles and thatched roofs. Our villa had its own mini grass courtyard, a bathroom and shower open to the sky, an enclosed air-conditioned bedroom and a second-floor deck ideal for practicing yoga, napping or taking in the black-faced langur monkeys that catapulted from tree limb to limb. Unpacking our pricey leggings and fitted tank tops, we answered the door for a hotel worker who delivered two pairs of off-white cotton drawstring pants and matching boxy tops — a yoga apparel set for each of us. We joked at the idea of putting them on, coming to realize after one yoga class the benefit of sweating in those loose, breathable garments rather than our own. Four miles from Gokarna village, SwaSwara resort sits alongside the Arabian Sea and extends across 26 acres, although more than half of its land is left untouched and protects the surrounding ecosystem. Devoted to sustainability, the hotel, its farms and swimming pool use only harvested rainwater — accumulated each year during the monsoon season — which is then treated and filtered. Entering the ayurveda building for my scheduled consultation on our arrival day, I was greeted by Dr. Firoz Varun, a thirtysomething, mustached man, whose wife, Dr. Kripa Krishnan, is also one of the resort’s three staff doctors. After taking my pulse and blood pressure, he asked me if I had any “body disturbances.” “If you mean injuries, I have a few,” I answered, a bit confused. We discussed my tight muscles, hip pain and hypermobility, and how lifestyle, diet and relationships are all influenced by our dosha. Dr. Varun went on to explain that every person has a combination of the five elements — fire, earth, water, air and ether — but some combinations are more prominent, determining your primary, and often a secondary, dosha. Reaching for the questionnaire I’d completed on the bus ride, Dr. Varun marked in all capital letters: Pitta-Kapha. To beat the intense heat, our days began with yoga at 6 a.m. Mats were waiting when we entered the yoga shala, Sanskrit for house, and Ms. Carlson led us in breathing exercises, meditations, chanting and poses to awaken our bodies. She encouraged us to pause and be mindful of the sounds — we heard many chirping kingfisher birds — smells and sights outside the open windows. For cooling down the body’s temperature, Ms. Carlson taught us sheetali breathing, during which we exhaled through a curled tongue or gritted teeth. Her teaching and crisp voice were a consistent, calming presence in a place where the heat, aromas, sounds and flavors felt, at times, overwhelming. “I’m here to invite in reminders to be and not just do, to pause and take time to reflect,” she said. “It’s an invitation to slow down and taste test India with some Kripalu-style yoga.” With more limber bodies and quieter minds, we went each morning from yoga to breakfast at the Cocum, the open-air dining room at the center of the resort — named after the reddish-purple fruit used in aruyvedic medicine to treat sores, improve digestion and lessen arthritis pain. All meals were included in our retreat, and breakfast included a daily selection of eggs to order, oatmeal and freshly cut fruit. In an effort to stay hydrated, I refilled my water bottle frequently from the large water tanks located at the yoga shala and domed meditation hut. I quickly learned, though, that ayurvedic doctrine recommends lukewarm water for optimal absorption into the body, so at meals, the water is served slightly warm with added natural flavors, such as fenugreek or cumin, that changed daily. Food — what, when and how much — plays an important role in ayurveda. Lunch and dinner at SwaSwara — served at either the Cocum or by the beach in a shady grove called the Beach Grill — began with a juice of the day (blueberry-lime blast anyone?), followed by an appetizer such as cucumber peanut salad or garden almond gazpacho, a choice of two main dishes, like fish curry cooked in Indian spices and cocum, or vegetable korma made with mixed vegetables, coriander, mint and coconut paste. Desserts were lacking in chocolate for my taste, but some, like ginger-baked banana and date squares, went over well with guests. The food is organic and every meal consisted of fresh, locally grown or sourced ingredients — mainly vegetables and fish — with a plated amount meant to leave you satiated, but not full, which, according to ayurveda, is easier on digestion. Our days at SwaSwara were unhurried and spacious, sprinkled with yoga, a late-morning group activity — bird-watching, nature walk, boat ride — a body treatment, a swim in the pool, or a walk along Om beach, where cows amble aimlessly, leaving hoof prints in the sand alongside those of vacationers’. Gathering in the meditation hut in the late afternoon, our Kripalu group — save for those who were napping — sat for a guided meditation or a gentle yoga class, led by Ms. Carlson or a resident teacher. I tried hard not to doze during a yoga nidra class led by Jayalakshmi Moily, whose melodic voice brought me right to the intended dreamy state of consciousness between waking and sleeping. On Thursday morning, we left the hotel grounds for an outing to Gokarna village, a 15-minute ride via tuk-tuk, a three-wheeled motorized rickshaw. Our guide, Matthew Raj — who doubles as SwaSwara’s art teacher — led us to Mahabaleshwar, a sacred 4th-century Hindu temple and pilgrimage site; to the Koti Tirtha, a sacred water tank used for ritual bathing; and to some shops where we could buy mala bead necklaces, traditionally used in prayer and meditation, and pretty fashionable in yoga and meditation circles. Thursday is market day, and we joined the meandering cows and throngs of locals, perusing the fresh fruits, vegetables and mounds of ginger piled atop tarps on the ground. Mr. Minhas Singh gave each of us 100 rupees (about $1.50) to buy some fresh ingredients, which the SwaSwara chef would use later that afternoon in a cooking demonstration. I spent 60 rupees on a kilogram of purple eggplants, and the rest on crisp, white daikon radishes. Nicole and another guest, Dana Rhoden, a publicist from Miami, pooled their cash to buy some cauliflower, a pricier choice than mine, costing about 150 rupees, or $2.30. After our morning in the crowded village, returning to SwaSwara was a chance to fall back into serenity. That afternoon, I was scheduled for a rejuvenation body treatment, with the addition of murivenna oil, made from a blend of herbs, which Dr. Varun selected because, he said, it increases circulation, and would help heal my muscle and joint soreness. All three of my treatments were given with four hands by Anchu Ajikrishna, a petite 20-year-old massage therapist, and an assistant. I held in my laughter as the assistant farted loudly — in ayurveda, passing gas is encouraged for colon health — while heating herbs and oil over a small flame. Ms. Ajikrishna tied a disposable undergarment around my waist and guided me to sit on a stool, before placing her hands over my head to chant a Sanskrit prayer, which, translated by Dr. Varun, asks “the unknown supreme God and great physician to heal the body from all miseries, body and mind.” The four hands swept in unison up and down my body — front and back — in what felt like a choreographed dance during each treatment. Once the oil rubbing or salt scrubbing part was over, Ms. Ajikrishna instructed me to wash my face and body in an outdoor shower with green mung bean powder, an herbal exfoliant used to cleanse the skin without removing the oil’s benefits. Dry and wrapped in a green robe, I was led back to the stool where Ms. Ajikrishna had recited the prayer. While I sipped a cup of herbal tea with honey, she rubbed rasna churna powder — a mix of plant roots and herbs — into my scalp to maintain the temperature of my body. To finish off the treatment, she placed an orange bindi (a dot, in Sanskrit) made from sandalwood paste, at the center of my forehead, an additional ayurvedic strategy for cooling down the body in the summertime heat. Our group had its final gathering in the meditation hut on Saturday afternoon, where Ms. Carlson asked us to reflect on our experience and share what we hoped to take home with us. “I’d like to make regular space for a yoga practice that is gentle and nurturing, and not one where I am pushing my body too hard,” I said. A few of us shed tears, touching on feelings of loss and resilience. “As the baby of the group, I’ve gained so much from the wisdom of these women who have shared some of their life experiences with me,” said Nicole, the youngest guest by nearly two decades. On the morning of our departure from SwaSwara, I unintentionally woke up at 4:30 a.m. Like the dolphins who leapt from the water earlier in the week, I felt some sort of magnetic pull from the outside. Trying not to awaken Nicole, I put on clothes, grabbed a flashlight and made my way along a path in the darkness to Meditation Hill, an open-air cliffside structure with straw mats and a view overlooking the Arabian Sea and Om beach. I sat down, closed my eyes, and listened to the waves, thinking of my brother, and the healing and nurturing this place provided. I opened my eyes and the morning light was just beginning to shine.",13903

By Lucas Peterson “Now, that bear is definitely not white,” said the Dutch tourist next to me. The giant panda turned in our direction at that moment and let out some kind of loud sneeze or snort as if to say, “Give me a break, pal.” It was raining and muddy, after all, and even slightly smudged, the panda bears at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding were still absurdly adorable. The bear ambled off to climb a nearby jungle gym-like structure, fell off it once or twice, eventually gave up, and finally settled on a choice piece of bamboo to munch on.  Pandas reside almost exclusively in central China, and while a handful can be seen in zoos worldwide, the research base in Chengdu, the thriving seat of China’s Sichuan Province, is one of the only places to see dozens of the animals thriving in a pseudo-natural habitat. It’s just one of many compelling reasons to visit. Despite being one of the country’s largest cities, Chengdu has largely flown under the radar for the tourist set; deep in the heart of China, it’s closer to Tibet than to Shanghai.  After recently spending 10 days there over two trips, I can say that it’s a fantastically exciting, progressive city, with plenty of museums and urban temples to explore, great shopping, as well as a famously spicy cuisine that will torch the careless. Animal attractions can be dicey, particularly in China (I once had a very depressing visit to the Beijing Zoo), but the research base is very well done — the animals seemed happy and active — and seemed to serve a larger purpose: conservation and research of a threatened species that’s notoriously slow to reproduce. The price was right, too: only 58 yuan (a little over $9) for admission. My advice is to get there in the morning — not only will you beat the crowds, but it’s the pandas’ breakfast time so they’re more active than usual. Don’t miss the nursery, either, which may have some very cuddly snoozing babies (there were three when I visited). How to get there? I recommend Chengdu’s clean, efficient subway system, and suggest you get used to taking it. The metro, which went into service in 2010, has been built with blinding, almost frightening, speed. There are now six subway lines in operation, meaning that a new one is added every 16 months or so in a city of more than 14 million people. Single-ride tickets vary based on distance, but expect to pay between 2 and 5 yuan when you ride. You’ll also notice no one bolting down the stairs to make a train in Chengdu; there’s almost always another one about three minutes behind. My lodging at the Chengdu Panda Apartment (Chengdu is proud of its pandas and you will see them in advertising and the names of businesses everywhere) was tricky to locate — it’s hidden in a residential apartment block — but the room was comfortable and the price reasonable (276 yuan per night). The décor was, as you might guess, extremely panda-heavy: blankets, towels, bedspreads — everything. Fortunately, I thought it was pretty cute. If you’re looking for something a little more traditional, I also stayed at the Sheraton Chengdu Lido Hotel, just one stop north of Tianfu Square, on the metro’s primary north-south line, for just 488 yuan per night. Getting into the city from the airport, incidentally, is fairly hassle-free. While there are shuttles into downtown, I would download and set up Didi Chuxing before your trip (check out other general China travel tips in my last article). My ride into the city cost just 45 yuan. One nice perk of the app is that if you message your driver in English (to tell him or her where you are, for example), it is automatically translated into Chinese. Taxis are also easy to hail in Chengdu, as are guys on motorbikes who will, for a fee, let you hop on the back and shuttle you to your destination. But I found that walking is the best way to get around Chengdu — the city isn’t as hectic as Beijing or Shanghai, and it’s a pleasant place to take a stroll.  For example, I walked to the Wenshu Monastery, a gorgeous and peaceful (and free) place to visit and learn about Chinese Buddhism. Built during the Sui dynasty (581-618 A.D.), the monastery is populated with almost all-wooden structures that are in remarkable shape. The Hall of Three Great Buddhisattva and the Mahavira Hall house gleaming, intricate Buddhist icons and treasures; you won’t be able to take photos of the statues themselves, but can photograph freely on the grounds. Don’t miss the Peace Pagoda of a Thousand Buddhas, a strikingly ornate 11-story tower that’s the tallest iron pagoda in China. Wenshu has one other perk — a lively garden area where tea and vegetarian food is served. It’s here that you can get a true sense of daily life in Chengdu. Purchase a package of tea from a small kiosk near the entrance (jasmine tea was 15 yuan) and grab a thermos of hot water and a bag of sunflower seeds or lightly sweetened peanuts (5 yuan, paid on the honor system). Show your tea receipt to a worker and they’ll give you a ceramic cup with a lid. Find yourself a seat in the meditative environs and drink tea and munch on snacks to your heart’s content. You’ll notice dozens of locals doing the same while laughing, chatting and playing cards — this is typical Chengdu. Park life is essential in China, as it’s one of the few ways to escape from the crush of urbanity that marks its major cities. People’s Park is another great place to walk around, unwind and take in the sights and sounds of local life. You’ll see exercise and singing classes in session, along with electronic meters displaying the current decibel levels (keeping it under 65 is recommended), as well as tea-drinking and ear-cleaning. That’s right — men wearing headlamps wander around with cotton swabs on the end of long, metal rods, offering to clean out your ears. If you hear a repeating tinny clang, you know the ear cleaners are near. Another of Chengdu’s historical treasures, the Jinsha Site Museum, has only been accessible recently, as it was accidentally discovered in 2001 during real estate development. What was uncovered is something of a lost city: excavation of the ancient capital of the Shu Kingdom, dating between the 7th and 12th centuries B.C., has unearthed different pottery, jade, ivory and gold artifacts. Walking the grounds, which include a small bamboo forest and garden of fragrant Japanese allspice, was worth admission alone (usually 80 yuan, but only 40 during the winter season, with an additional 40 for an audio guide).  I was able to take advantage of another winter discount at Wuhou Temple, also known as the Temple of Marquis, paying 30 yuan instead of the usual 60. The temple is dedicated to the life of Zhuge Liang and the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 A.D.), an era revered among Chinese for its political intrigue and military strategy. While visiting Wuhou, take some time to browse Jinli Street, which runs along the edge of the temple. There you’ll find, concentrated in one fairly touristy area, an enormous variety of regional cuisine: Roujiamo (a hamburger-like sandwich, 10 yuan), spicy tofu covered in fish mint (10 yuan), and skewers of baby squid (20 yuan). I picked up a block of glutinous rice cake slathered in chili, scallions and hot oil for 8 yuan. Markets are another great place to check out Chengdu’s seemingly endless food offerings. Jordan Porter, who runs a local food tour company called Chengdu Food Tours, tipped me off to a bustling local market near the west side of the 1st Ring Road called Qingyang Market. It has everything you could want, from pig’s feet to sugar cane stalks, homemade sausages, crocks of blindingly potent baijiu (grain alcohol), fresh tofu, spices and vats of doubanjiang, a spicy, fermented bean paste. After doing a couple of loops, I sat down at Yanjing Mian. a small restaurant near the market’s entrance, for a piquant bowl of hand-pulled noodles with pieces of short rib (10 yuan). Street food, incidentally, has its drawbacks. If you’re an adventurous eater, sometimes you get sick. One day on Dongsheng Street, near People’s Park, I noticed some appealing-looking stacked metal containers outside one storefront. They were sputtering steam and brimming with soft, fluffy baozi (dumplings). I bought a bag of eight (6 yuan) and chowed down happily as I turned left on Ningxia Street. After I’d inhaled three, I noticed something felt slightly off. I won’t get into the details, but let’s just say I didn’t find a place to solve the issue in time. It was a long, humbling walk home.  The silver lining: Drugstores are plentiful in China (they’ll sometimes have a green awning or ads for knockoff Viagra in the front), and the people who work there couldn’t care less about your problems. Later that day, I went into one called Bai Xin Tang and announced, “la duzi” (diarrhea). The woman behind the counter scarcely looked up from what she was doing as she tossed me a box of pills (30 yuan). If you decide to go the safer restaurant route, you won’t be disappointed, either. Chuan chuan is essential Chengdu — skewers of different meats and vegetables sitting in a bath of spicy oil (dinner for two might run 60 to 80 yuan) — as is getting an entire fish. My first night in the city, I met two friends, Chengdu locals, at Kao Master, a restaurant on the seventh floor of the International Finance Square Mall, near the extremely hip Chunxi Road area.  We opted for a whole hot-and-sour fish (qianyu, from Guizhou province, 129 yuan), tangy and flavorful, and slathered in bright orange chili peppers. As I popped one, and then another, of the blisteringly hot peppers into my mouth — primarily to demonstrate that I was a foreigner with an iron gut and unafraid of spicy local cuisine — one of my companions, Jasmine, looked at me quizzically. “Why are you eating all those?” she asked. “They’re just for flavor.” Lesson learned.

By Stephanie Rosenbloom If ever there was any doubt about the state of the American road trip, the latest research seems to squash it, finding that more travelers are driving hundreds of miles to explore ​unfamiliar ​places, even if they have only four or five days to do it. ​ “They’re not taking the two-week road trip of the past,” said Steve Cohen, the senior vice president for Travel Insights at MMGY Global​, one of the largest travel and hospitality marketing firm​s.  Road trips represented some 22 percent of vacations taken by United States travelers in 2015, but a year later that number jumped to 39 percent, according to MMGY Global’s 2017-18 Portrait of American Travelers, a report compiled from nearly 3,000 interviews with leisure travelers. The spike ​came as the travel industry ​roared back from the recession​, hitting record levels of vacation spending, ​​ and​ as travelers stayed within the country. Nearly 14 million more vacations were taken within the United States during the past year compared with outside the country, MMGY Global found. Today, most American vacations — some 85 percent — are domestic. ​​And while it may be tempting to attribute​​ interest in road-tripping to nostalgia​ (and there is certainly some of that)​, it seems the top reasons people ​are​ ​hitting the road are ​matters of practicality. The leading two reasons​, according to the research report, ​ are the flexibility of being able to stop along the way, and of being able to pack whatever and however much people want to take in the car. Lower vacation costs ranked third, and have been of particular importance to millennials. Additionally, there’s the airport pain factor. Many travelers prefer to avoid the security lines and hefty baggage fees at legacy carriers, not to mention the 30 to 40 minutes spent waiting at baggage claim. ​For those traveling with pets, driving is easier, especially as airlines begin to tighten rules regarding service animals. (It’s worth noting that MMGY’s qualitative research focuses on the traveling public; people making at least $50,000 a year, which Mr. Cohen said essentially eliminates half the United States population.)​ Speaking of easier, ​inexperienced travelers have also contributed to the spike in domestic travel, Mr. Cohen said, as they tend to shy away from international travel amid political instability and concerns about safety. ​​Though some Americans​ may ​fly to another state and begin ​their road trip there, Mr. Cohen and his colleagues are seeing many more people simply driving from home. It’s typically less expensive, and a road trip offers more flexibility in terms of schedule. Travelers can relax, leave at the last minute, and discover historical sites, local cuisine, museums, shopping, hiking, festivals and theme parks along the way.  ​Despite taking shorter trips, people nonetheless want to roam as far away as possible. “They don’t want to spend the night any closer than eight hours from home,” Mr. Cohen said. And the trip has to have multiple overnight stops​ with activities and attractions​, “not just Grandma’s house,” he said. For example, Mr. Cohen said retirees typically visit family during their road trips, but most of the time they stay elsewhere. From the inception of the vacation, to the miles logged along the way, social media is a comparatively new aspect of the road trip. In the last four years MMGY has observed the role of social media in recording and sharing travel experiences explode, mainly among millennials. The percentage of people who say they post vacation photos on social media to make friends and family jealous has doubled over the last four years — “we believe that one’s grossly understated,” Mr. Cohen added — as has the number of people who use social media to record their travel experiences.  ​Instagram and the like aside, road-tripping is among the few travel trends today not being, er, driven by millennials. Boomers are the largest group of road-trippers (followed by Generation Xers), and for them, it seems there’s some element of nostalgia. For millennials, the appeal of the road trip is often economical, though for many, and for a number of Generation Xers, life experiences like road trips matter more than shiny new things, according to MMGY. How people choose where to travel was something of a surprise to Mr. Cohen, who reasonably figured that the first thing most people do when planning a vacation is to decide where to go. Turns out, less than half the people he studied do that. Instead, he said, people tend to say “Here’s what I want to do, now where can I do it?” For millennials it may be, “I have this much money, where can I best spend it?” There isn’t just one type of road-tripper with a single set of goals. And road-tripping is unlikely to experience another dramatic rise. “It can’t just keep skyrocketing,” Mr. Cohen said​​. But he expects to see modest growth​ this year​ as Americans​ — retirees, young families, millennials, Generation Xers without children — continue rolling on.

By Seth Sherwood One of the first Thai words that foreigners learn in Bangkok is farang, or foreigner. And no wonder. More than 20 million farang descend on the temples and temptations of Thailand’s capital every year, making it one of the planet’s most visited cities. You run into each other in hotels and restaurants, in the air-conditioned mega-malls of Siam Square, at the teeming Chatuchak outdoor market and the Buddhist sites of Wat Pho and Wat Arun. Together, you jostle through the crowds along the buzzing Sukhumvit strip and the backpacker haven of Khao San Road. And there you are again, venturing into the famous go-go bars of Patpong and Soi Cowboy. Fortunately, Bangkok is vast and fast-evolving, with many remote corners and newly minted hangouts. From upstart creative spaces and restaurants to obscure back street bars to the under-visited Thonburi district, Bangkok remains ripe for discovery.    “Are Tuk-Tuks and Pad Thai Really Thai?” That question, embossed on a wall, welcomes you to the recently reopened Museum Siam, an interactive, high-tech fun house whose motto is “Decoding Thainess.” Exploring the galleries is like bouncing around a pinball machine: Surfaces light up, bells ring and characters and objects suddenly pop out of floors and walls as you accumulate knowledge about Thai history, royalty, fashion, food, Buddhism and pop culture. (Spoiler alert: Tuk-tuks arrived in Thailand via postwar Italy and Japan.)    Urban chaos gives way to villagelike (and farang-free) tranquillity across the nearby Memorial Bridge. Featuring an ersatz mountain dotted with Buddha statues, the rock garden of the Wat Prayoon complex is a haven of grottoes, pavilions, roaming turtles and fish ponds. Alongside it, a soaring, white, bell-shaped chedi surrounded by 18 smaller white chedis is a simultaneously massive and minimalist monument. Go past the Church of Santa Cruz (originally constructed by Portuguese settlers; the present structure was rebuilt in the early 20th century) and follow the slim riverbank path to Kuan An Keng. The Chinese-built temple is adorned with red pillars, golden bells and sculpted dragons; beyond it, is the dazzling, multitiered, 19th-century Buddhist temples and bell tower of Wat Kalayanamitr. A ferry (5 baht, or about 16 cents) returns you across the river in minutes. Gaggan is regularly ranked as Asia’s best restaurant. Don’t eat there. Just across the passageway is the less fastidious, less expensive, less-hyped, almost-brand-new and truly sublime dining experience known as Gaa, where you don’t have to book weeks in advance. (A few days are enough — for now). Décor consists of industrial materials and autumnal hues, music ranges from bossa nova to Bowie, and the innovative food comes courtesy of the Indian chef Garima Arora, who worked previously at Copenhagen’s Noma restaurant and, yes, Gaggan. The 10-course menu (2,200 baht) might showcase Indo-Siamese hybrids (Thai crayfish on Indian flatbread with shell bisque), high-end comfort food (warm fermented tofu whey with charcoal-roasted cauliflower), meaty-sweet mash-ups (chilled shards of chicken-liver mousse on toast with longan jam) or fruity fun desserts.    For most travelers, Chinatown’s appeals are street food and the huge gold Buddha in Wat Traimit. But the small nearby lane called Soi Nana is a gold mine of new bars. The red neon, flickering candles and dark wood at Ba Hao evoke a sultry den from 1930s Shanghai — complete with Opium (a Negroni variant with ginseng, herbal liquor and tiny chrysanthemum bulbs). Thai pride suffuses the cozy, candlelit Tep Bar. Not hungry for fried baby bamboo caterpillars? Try a herbal liquor, rice wine or Nila Pat cocktail (Thai rum, ginger syrup and a black gelatin cube made with Thai herbs) and absorb the traditional Thai music performances.    Want to rub sweaty elbows with tens of thousands of retail enthusiasts in a 27-acre, sun-seared outdoor market with some 15,000 booths hocking coconut-shell ashtrays, elephant-print pants, jasmine soaps, striped cushions and countless other wares? If not, swap overloaded Chatuchak market for undervisited Papaya, a soaring air-conditioned warehouse-shop packed with a museumlike collection of vintage goods: bellows cameras, Jacobsen chairs, barber poles, 1970s computers, claw foot tubs, Oriental rugs, snuff boxes, surgery lamps and so much else — except other shoppers.    Cheap, noisy, no-frills, white-tiled, overbright: Krua Apsorn bears all the signs of a top-notch traditional eating room. Skip the crab omelet — locally famous but overrated — for spicy seafood specimens like silvery sillago fish (in a fiery soup of beans, peas and leaves) and plump tom yum shrimp (in coconut-milk broth with mushroom chunks). Lunch for two costs around 700 baht. For dessert, nearby Mont Nomsod is a Bangkok institution, beloved for its thick white toast spread with sweet toppings (25 baht) like coconut-egg custard, and chunky corn soup.  What happens to old post offices in the internet era? Hopefully they end up like the Bangkok General Post Office, which now houses the Thailand Creative and Design Center. In addition to a library, studios and a large exhibition area — recently host to an excellent elucidation of Thai architecture — the center features a boutique selling hipster sneakers by Truly, minimalist wooden clocks from Pana Objects and other Thai products. Up the road, Warehouse 30 ups the neighborhood’s creative quotient with an indie documentary cinema, a gallery-cafe and shops selling everything from steampunk fashion to vintage stereo equipment.    Like Thai boxing and Thai spices, Thai massage is not for the weak. During a 60-minute session (350 baht) at Ruen Nuad — a humble wooden house amid the skyscrapers and crowds of downtown Bangkok — you become the soft target of the masseuse’s powerful knees, elbows, forearms and fists as he or she stretches you like Play-Doh, twists you like Twizzlers, folds you like origami and presses you down like an overstuffed suitcase. All the pulling, prodding, pummeling and, yes, punching can make you feel like the dummy in a model-mugging defense class, but you will walk outside feeling as limber and light as a ghost.  “In praise of the wondrous beauty of nature…,” reads the menu cover at Cuisine de Garden: Unexpected words in a tall, dense metropolis with few green spaces. But this glassy and hushed restaurant that opened last year offers an organic enclave amid the asphalt and concrete. The project starts with the décor — slim tree trunks stretch from floor to ceiling, like an indoor forest — and continues with a four-course menu (1,590 baht) and various amuse-bouche whims. The lineup might include a leaf-shaped brioche served atop a real leaf, a shrimp-mussel-salmon-crab quartet deployed on small white stones, or a soft-boiled egg atop a nestlike structure of crispy rice noodles and a bed of pulled chicken: a gooey, warm, crispy and meaty interplay of farmyard flavors.    “Massage? Massage?” Amid the louche bars and dubious “spas” of the Sukhumvit back streets, two classy cocktail dens have discretely sprouted up. Inside Sri Trat, Frank Sinatra croons while bartenders in vests pour sly Thai cocktails like the O-Liang (Scotch, port wine, Thai coffee and amaro) for guests ensconced on tufted leather stools. Thailand meets Tokyo at Salon du Japonisant, where an unmarked door opens into a chic speakeasy outfitted with Chesterfield-style couches, low armchairs and three menus: one for whiskey and Calvados, one for sakes, and one for cocktails. The Old Fashioned 2017 is a dry, spicy and sophisticated blend of Suntory whiskey, green tea bitters, forest bitters, cinnamon stick, orange and Japanese black honey.    A tranquil and spiritual side of the city appears when you motor through the water channels of Thonburi in a canopied wooden boat. (Sinchai Travel, a.k.a. Longtail Boat Tour, has its ticket office on Sathorn Pier. A 90-minute trip costs 1,500 to 1,800 baht per person.) Bangkok’s towers vanish and soon you are among old wooden canal houses and plank piers where children fish, white cranes swoop down, women in motorboats pass with skewered meats for sale, and magnificent temples and mountainous Buddhas suddenly materialize.    To reach Oldman Coffee, drop your car or taxi at the highway overpass, duck under the fuselage of the decommissioned Lockheed passenger jet, follow the gravel path past the toilet-plunger-toss arcade game, turn left at the helicopter and go past the Victorian-style photo portrait studio. If you reach the huge metal skull the size of a garbage truck, you’ve gone too far. Such are the attractions of ChangChui, a new alternative theme park and Gothic wonderland, complete with shooting gallery, food stalls, vintage shops, artist studios, open-air bars and concert halls — to say nothing of deactivated torpedoes, disused tractor-trailers, human-size robots and an exhibition room with skulls and stuffed birds. If you need lunch, try Insects in the Backyard restaurant. At your own risk.      Opened in late 2017, the 231-room Lancaster Bangkok is a spacious and luxurious newcomer with a gym, spa, restaurant, rooftop pool and multiple bars. Double rooms in February from 3,360 baht. Alternatively, save money at Old Town Hostel — a 1920s building with 12 dormitories and nine private rooms — then splurge at the adjoining 80/20. Decorated in an industrial style, the gallery-restaurant serves daring, playful and delectable neo-Thai concoctions. Double rooms from 800 baht.  In the heart of the emerging Chinatown bar scene, 103 Bed and Brews has six rooms with tasteful retro furnishings and a cool cafe with multiple cold brew coffees and Thai microbrews. Rooms from 1,250 baht.    Advertisement",9951

Here are some tips to get by from someone who does it all the time. By Shivani Vora Traveling to a foreign country can be daunting if you don’t know the local language, and while François Thibault, the cellar master and co-founder of Grey Goose, speaks only French, his job requires constant travel around the world. “Over the years, I’ve learned how to navigate foreign countries with limited verbal communication,” he said. Mr. Thibault has a number of tips to help travelers manage in a destination when they don’t speak the native tongue, based on his own experience. Here are a few of them.  Traveling in foreign countries has become much easier in the past few years thanks to the many foreign language apps which translate words on the spot. Mr. Thibault tends to rely on Google Translate and suggests that travelers find an app that works for them. Ideally, find one that specializes in the language you need to translate especially if the language uses a character set you’re not familiar with, or have difficulty pronouncing.  But take note: in Mr. Thibault’s experience, these apps work best when you’re trying to decipher something in writing, like a restaurant menu or a street sign, rather than in the midst of a conversation.  Pointing with your hands and nodding or shaking your head, Mr. Thibault said, are an easy way to communicate with locals in the country you’re in. “Gestures are almost all universally understood,” he said.  There are exceptions however. In many of the countries in the Balkans, for example, nodding means “no,” and shaking your head means “yes.” Also, although a smile usually conveys friendliness, in some countries such as Russia, locals don’t smile at people they don’t know. A quick web search for the country you’re visiting and “gestures” or “body language” will turn up anything you need to be aware of before you go. Knowing basic words and phrases like “hello,” “thank you” and “I’m sorry, I don’t speak [insert the language of the country you’re visiting], do you speak English?” are a must, Mr. Thibault said. Showing that you care enough to learn some of the language before you went, and at least enough to acknowledge that you don’t know more, is a form of respect and will go a long way to endear you to locals.  He suggested going on YouTube to find a tutorial on how to spell and say basic words and phrases, ideally from native speakers eager to teach would-be visitors. “It’ll take five minutes of your time and is well worth it,” he said.  If you feel particularly uncomfortable in the country you’re headed to, and you have to go anyway, relying on a local travel agent who knows both your and your destination’s language can be incredibly useful.  He or she can step in to help translate over the phone should any major issues arise, especially with things like flights, lodging, or other travel-related issues. Many agents also offer services 24 hours a day, so help is just a quick call away no matter what the problem may be.  A tour guide can help you get a better grasp of the local language and is a good person to practice words and phrases with. Whenever Mr. Thibault visits a new country, he books a sightseeing tour with a guide on the first day of his trip. “I use this day to learn about my destination and get familiar with the language,” he said.  You can always search the web for local tour guides and fixers before you go, or alternatively find a guide through your hotel’s concierge a travel agent or by calling the local tourist office.

Arty younger Parisians are flocking to this atmospheric old working-class quarter, which has seen a wave of new and reasonably priced restaurants. One was just awarded a Michelin star. By Alexander Lobrano  For years, the 11th and 12 arrondissements, two formerly quiet, working class neighborhoods in eastern Paris, have been the preferred location for the French capital’s best young chefs. Why? Affordable apartments assure a hungry young clientele for the new restaurateurs who choose the area for its low-rent commercial spaces. Now a growing number of the city’s fledgling cooks are setting up shop in another atmospheric old working-class quarter: Montmartre, a hilltop district in the 18th arrondissement best known for the Sacre Coeur basilica and the artists who once lived and worked here — Toulouse-Lautrec, Utrillo and Modigliani, among others. Today, most of the action is on the back of La Butte (the mound, in French), as the locals call this spot in the center of Montmartre. Here on the north-facing slope of the district, arty younger Parisians who’d rather spend their money on good food than rent are flocking to a wave of excellent new and reasonably priced casual restaurants, including one that was just awarded a Michelin star.  Aside from the miniature Jeff Koons-style sculptures adorning the tables, this year-and-a-half old place on a quiet side street looks like countless unremarkable middlebrow neighborhood restaurants in Paris. The locals know better, since young chef Laurent Magnin’s superb contemporary French cooking had made it one of the capital’s most exciting dark-horse tables. In early February, though, it won a star in the 2018 Michelin Guide to France, so the secret is out. Still, the snag for some may be that there’s no a la carte menu here. Instead, they only serve multicourse, blind tasting menus, although food phobias and allergies are respected. The menu changes often but dishes like risotto garnished with veal-stock lacquered crayfish; grilled sea bream with peanut sauce and a deconstructed paella are as beautiful to taste at as they are to behold. Good value for the money, and open for both lunch and dinner on Saturdays, too. 39 rue Lamarck, 18th Arrondissement, restaurantlarcane.com Supplied daily by the country’s Atlantic, North Sea and Mediterranean ports, landlocked Paris is one of the world’s best cities for seafood lovers. The hitch? The sparkling fresh catch of the day is generally expensive. This explains why this year-old spot in a slickly redecorated former hardware store has become such a hit — their high-tide menu is easy on the wallet. Start with some smoked haddock, Breton oysters or shrimp with homemade mayonnaise, and then go for dishes like tuna tartare with black rice, cabbage, radishes and trout eggs; scallops with watercress, ricotta, Granny Smith apple and dried black olives; or octopus with cockles, broccoli and poutargue (dried fish eggs). Great list of craft beers and natural wines, too. 98 rue Marcadet, 18th Arrondissement, fichon.fr The puckish name of this year-old organic vegan-vegetarian bistro — an abattoir is a slaughterhouse — comes from the fact that this stylish light-filled restaurant was formerly a butcher shop. The menu changes often but runs to dishes like a starter of quinoa-sweet-potato-and-red-cabbage rolls, blanquette of seitan (chewy wheat protein) in sesame cream and rose-and-pistachio cake. 61 rue Ramey, 18th Arrondissement, facebook.com/abattoirvegetal A favorite French dictum is “Tout est bon dans le cochon,” or “Everything’s good from the pig.” For proof, come to this friendly bistro that celebrates the succulence of French pork in a variety of preparations, including an andouillette millefeuille, grilled pig’s ears with oranges and coriander, head cheese with capers and shallots, and pork belly roasted with citrus fruits. Non-porcine options include chicken-liver terrine, a catch-of-the-day fish and duck, and the profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce should not be missed. 185 rue Marcadet, 18th Arrondissement,lecochongaulois.com Since it opened just over a year ago, this good-looking modern bistro with a market-driven menu, oak-plank floors and Scandinavian style furniture has become one of the popular tables in the neighborhood. The chef Romain Lamon and his team work at a small open kitchen in the back of the room, and their seasonally evolving menu runs to contemporary French comfort food that’s consistently light, inventive and satisfying. Expect dishes like ravioli filled with egg yolks and miso, braised beef cheeks with lemon-carrot purée, and a clever riff on crème brûlée that comes with roasted apples and crushed pecans.  35 rue Ramey, 18th Arrondissement, polissons-restaurant.fr Advertisement",4860

By Elaine Glusac Less than a year after a Supreme Court decision legalized same-sex marriage in Bermuda, the government of the British Overseas Territory has outlawed it, a reversal that is poised to roil the waters of the cruise industry and potentially threaten travel to the island. The country where a ship is registered influences how cruise lines conduct marriages at sea. Cruise Lines International Association, a trade group comprised most of the industry’s cruise lines, said that about 10 percent of its members’ ships are registered in Bermuda, accounting for about 13 percent of passenger capacity.  Subsequent to the reversal, cruise ships registered in Bermuda that offered same-sex weddings have determined they can no longer do so.  When same-sex marriage was legalized in Bermuda last May, Cunard, which registers its fleet in Bermuda, announced it would extend its wedding-at-sea packages to same-sex couples, with marriage licenses issued in Bermuda. Cunard held its first shipboard same-sex marriage in January.  Given the repeal, another couple, who had planned to marry next fall on a ship, has decided to wed before the sailing, according to a company spokeswoman. Of the 17 ships in its fleet, Princess Cruises has 13 ships registered in Bermuda, and began offering same-sex weddings on them after the change in law last year.  “Because Princess had not yet formally launched a same-sex wedding program we had only a few couples with bookings,” wrote Negin Kamali, a spokeswoman for Princess, in an email.  Two weddings previously approved by Bermuda will be allowed to proceed in March, but another two couples with shipboard marriage plans later in the year will be offered a refund if they wish to cancel. Catering to British travelers, P&O Cruises, which, like Princess and Cunard, is part of the Carnival Corporation group of cruise lines, began offering same-sex ceremonies at sea last spring. Most of its eight ships are registered in Bermuda.  “What we know is that both the cruise industry and L.G.B.T.Q. cruisers are eager to have the option to marry same-sex couples at sea. The reversal was a huge setback for both,” wrote Colleen McDaniel, the senior executive editor of Cruise Critic, a website dedicated to cruising, in an email. There are alternatives for couples seeking to wed at sea. Celebrity Cruises, which registers most of its ships in Malta where same-sex marriage was legalized last summer, held its first gay wedding in January. Beyond cruise ships, the marriage reversal risks tourism cancellations on the island. Bermuda is coming off a record year in tourism, likely boosted by the America’s Cup yacht race, which took place there last May and June. According to figures recently released by the Bermuda Tourism Authority, some 692,947 visitors traveled to the island, the largest in recorded history dating to 1995. Tourism was up 7 percent over 2016. The tourism authority, which is an independent, nongovernmental agency, publicly lobbied against the ban. In December, it sent a letter to island senators, predicting tourism losses in the wake of same-sex marriage restriction. It cited the case of the transgender bathroom bill, rescinded last year, that cost North Carolina an estimated $3.76 billion in business and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed in 2016 by then-governor Mike Pence in Indiana, which allowed business owners to deny services to patrons based on their sexual orientation. In its wake, Indianapolis lost 12 conventions representing up to $60 million in spending. “Significantly, it’s not only L.G.B.T. travelers that care about equal rights based on sexual orientation. Our research indicates many companies, consumers and travelers, including the overwhelming majority of the younger visitors powering Bermuda’s growth, care about this issue,” said the letter, signed by Kevin Dallas, the chief executive officer of the Bermuda Tourism Authority. The global value of L.G.B.T. travel is over $211 billion, according to Out Now, a marketing and consulting firm that specializes in the L.G.B.T. market. Jack S. Ezon, the president of Ovation Vacations, a travel agency based in New York, said that the prime season for travel bookings to Bermuda, which is seen as a last-minute getaway, is May. But already nearly 5 percent of the firm’s reservations to the island have been canceled not just by L.G.B.T.Q. couples but friends who “feel they do not want to support an economy that is, in one person’s words, ‘backward,’” Mr. Ezon wrote in an email.   L.G.B.T.Q. activists point to legislative wins since 2012 in Bermuda, including an anti-discrimination measure that protects people on the basis of sexual orientation and the opening of adoption to same-sex couples. “The change by their government wouldn’t cause our association to deter travelers from experiencing the beauty of Bermuda, nor the many countries globally that don’t have gay marriage,” said John Tanzella, the president and chief executive officer of the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association, of which the Bermuda Tourism Authority is a member. “Bermuda does have protection laws that include sexual orientation.”   Advertisement",5335

Here are some wallet-friendly excursions to expand your horizons. By Shivani Vora What’s better than a spring getaway to Europe? Answer: A spring getaway to Europe at an attractive price. If you’re looking for a bargain, March through May are value-friendly months for a European trip.  According to the airfare prediction app Hopper, for example, round-trip prices for tickets from the United States to Europe were an average of $870 in April. In June, the start of Europe’s peak tourist season, that number jumped to $1,110, and in December, that number is $1,050.  Also, Simone Amorico, a co-owner of Access Europe, a company that sells private, high-end trips to Europe, said that a European vacation is 30 to 50 percent less expensive in spring, compared with the summer. “A holiday that’s $10,000 in June will cost between $5,000 to $7,000 in April or May, depending on the destination,” he said. Whether you’re on a budget, or just like to make your dollar stretch, you have plenty of options. In Italy’s Lake Como, the 19th-century Villa Flori, built by the Marchese Raimond (whose daughter was one of the Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi’s many conquests), has a two-night package for two people that includes accommodations in a junior suite with a balcony overlooking the lake, a welcome amenity of two cocktails, two hourlong massages in the property’s spa, daily breakfast and one lunch. Prices start at 700 euros (about $865), and you can book by emailing the property, at info@hotelvillaflori.it.  In Tuscany, Il Poggione, a winery set in the countryside of Montalcino, offers visitors a seven-night package in its agriturismo, situated in a restored farmhouse. Guests stay in a two-bedroom apartment with a kitchen, get a private tour of the winery, enjoy a multicourse lunch paired with wines and have access to bikes they can use to explore the region. Prices start around 1,500 euros. Book by emailing the winery directly, at agriturismo@ilpoggione.it.

Other times, lively discussions with new friends. And at every stop in the hut system there’s the Intentions Book. It’s must-reading. By Jeremy Cronon Finally scrambling out of the bush of New Zealand’s South Island, I paused, surveying the alpine valley in the foreground. Then I saw it. Nestled against a slab of moss-covered schist stood a modest structure, no larger than my 8 feet by 12 feet college dorm room. With excitement and relief, I clambered toward Cameron Hut. As a 10-year-old, entranced by the cinematic landscapes of Peter Jackson’s “The Fellowship of the Ring,” I wouldn’t have guessed that backcountry huts would become a focal point of my travels in New Zealand. Sixteen years later, I had come for the forests of Lothlorien, the peaks of the Misty Mountains, the hills of the Shire. But it was in the huts that I immersed myself in the culture of those landscapes and spent time with the people who know and value them most. New Zealand’s wild spaces deserve their fantastical reputation, but it is the country’s commitment to this vast network of public huts that fosters something unique: a community of strangers even in the most remote backcountry. Approaching Cameron Hut, I wondered what I would find inside. No two huts are the same. Some are blaze orange, others beige. Some are over a century old, others less than a decade. Even if they look similar from the outside, each hut has its own quirks, stories and memories. They are a product of their environment, the people who use them, and their moment in history, all of which define a hut’s character. In 1987, the newly established Department of Conservation took responsibility for maintaining New Zealand’s hut network and the web of tracks (the term for trails) that connects them. Some huts originated as outposts for miners, hunters, foresters, or shepherds, others as way stations for alpinists, scientists, tourists or tramping club members. Now, nearly a thousand of these structures are open to trampers (as overnight backpackers are known) for minimal fees.  Pushing open Cameron Hut’s weathered door, I found four bunks on one wall with a potbelly stove braced against another. A metal countertop stretched beneath the window with a pair of water buckets and two stools stashed below. A wall shelf contained outdoor magazines, a copy of “The Girl on the Train,” candles of assorted lengths and a jar of ear plugs. And there, over by the window in its familiar bracket on the wall, was the volume I had learned always to peruse when I arrived at one of these huts: The Intentions Book. Setting my pack down, I started scanning its pages. Emblazoned with the Maori greeting “Kia ora,” the logbook serves as a guide to each hut and a registry for all visitors. Trampers use it to record details about their party and intended route — hence the name of the book — along with their comments and stories. While some of this information could prove useful in an emergency, it amounts to a beloved anthology of the shared experiences that define New Zealand’s huts. One page might contain mountaintop epiphanies, off-trail discoveries, weather and trail conditions, speculations about whether a bickering couple would survive the trail ahead and whimsical evaluations of the previous night’s snoring. Together, the entries form a living document of hut culture itself, where stories, knowledge, advice and humor pass freely among strangers. It didn’t take me long to find what I was seeking: the entry my new friends Joanna and Logan had made here a few weeks ago. Our paths had intersected on the Dart Track, a popular, multiday trek through the mountains north of Queenstown, where we had compared lists of must-visit huts over dinner. I was here because they had told me not to miss it.  Cameron Hut wasn’t glamorous, but it felt perfectly suited to the needs of a solo traveler. There are four tiers of huts in the system. Basic Huts are any combination of walls and a roof that will pass for “very basic shelter,” but not much more. Standard Huts are more robust but still spartan structures with a few added amenities like mattresses, water access, a toilet and a wood stove — though if users of such huts want a fire, they must forage for downed branches to maintain the wood supply. Serviced Huts feel similar to their Standard brethren, but are generally in high-traffic areas or above tree-line, where the Department of Conservation must supply fuel and upkeep costs skyrocket. Great Walks Huts are the most heavily visited and expensive of the bunch, with gas stoves and resident hut wardens.  No matter what its tier, I found every hut worth visiting.  Putting away the Intentions Book, I took advantage of the warm afternoon sun to explore the area around Cameron Hut. Just outside the door, a small shed protected a wood pile and well-worn ax. The “long drop,” an outhouse over an abnormally deep hole, sat nestled in a thicket of silver beech 150 feet north of the hut. To the west, I followed the river until I discovered the series of deep pools beneath a pair of towering waterfalls that Joanna and Logan had told me to visit. Laying my towel on a rock, I braced myself for what would be an undoubtedly frigid but equally necessary bath. Not a bad place to call home for the night. When you arrive at a hut, any sense of urgency melts away and is replaced by the easy rhythms of hut life. When a predictably unpredictable New Zealand storm blows through, you close the windows and open your book. When your stomach rumbles, you start dinner. When the sun disappears behind the mountains, you light a candle or flick on your headlamp. In a hut, you face simple choices. As quaint as they may seem, huts also serve a very real need. They provide essential shelter in New Zealand’s most extreme environments. Even hardened adventurers could be convinced to choose the protection of Iris Burn Hut over the characteristic downpours of Fiordlands or the warmth of Mueller Hut over the unpredictable snowfields of the Southern Alps. Huts are at their finest when weather is at its foulest.  For me, this realization came on the Richmond Alpine Track as I tramped through storm clouds so dense that I could rarely see more than 30 feet ahead. Exhausted and borderline hypothermic, I kindled a fire at each hut, decorating the wood stove with my saturated layers of clothing As horizontal rain beat hard against the walls, I savored the fire and a steaming mug of soup. It was only after I emerged from the mountains that I learned I had hiked through the remnants of Cyclone Debbie, which had killed 14 people in Australia and caused widespread flooding throughout New Zealand. Without those huts, anyone on the route I had just hiked could have fallen victim to that storm’s violence. But inclement weather was the furthest thing from my mind as I settled into Cameron Hut on this sunny autumn afternoon in mid-March. The valley would protect me from the all too familiar winds that had threatened to peel Slaty Hut right off its exposed perch in the Richmond Range. Neither too big nor too small, Cameron Hut’s modest footprint couldn’t compete with the 32-bunk, multiroom huts with flush toilets on the Rees-Dart Track in Mount Aspiring National Park. Yet it felt palatial compared to the tiny Sefton Bivvy — I couldn’t even stand completely — nestled beneath the Tewaewae Glacier. The size and grandeur of backcountry huts are often linked to their popularity, and prices follow suit. Basic Huts are free, but most huts in New Zealand range from $3 to $10 per night. Bunks fill up on a first-come, first-serve basis, but there is always room on the floor. Great Walks Huts, on the other hand, can cost up to $35 per night and require reservations months in advance. For committed hut travelers, there are six-month ($65) and yearlong ($85) passes, which grant you unlimited access to most Basic, Standard and Serviced Huts. With just a few visits to Serviced Huts, the pass more than pays for itself.  At Cameron Hut, my dinnertime ritual began by fetching river water in the buckets. Almost every hut has some access to water, but that was the only time I used buckets. More established huts have well water pumped through interior sinks. Others have external rainwater catchment cisterns with an attached faucet. The Department of Conservation encourages all users to treat or boil their water before consumption. Huts provide water, but hut users pack their own food and stove. Meals are lightweight and calorie-dense, ranging from prepackaged, dehydrated beef stroganoff to a ramen noodle and mashed potato slurry. I will never forget, however, the night when two Italians cooked me a gourmet pasta dinner, utilizing an entire pumpkin (and massive bottle of wine) that they had hauled to the hut. People cook alongside strangers, sharing their meals around communal tables. For dessert, someone almost always passed around a massive bar of Whittaker’s chocolate. As I chopped veggies, I kept glancing down the trail running alongside Cameron Creek, wondering if anyone would be joining me for the night. I would welcome time with strangers, but I also relished solitude. You never know who is going to walk through the door of a hut, but you can be fairly confident that your time together will be marked by a trust and civility that Americans rarely expect from total strangers. Generosity and hospitality anchor the communitarian ethos that makes these backcountry huts so welcoming. More often than not, I shared huts with other travelers. On the Motatapu Track, I spent two nights playing euchre with a trio of Coloradans. I met a French Canadian couple on a sunny afternoon at Greenstone Hut, only to run into them again after a soggy and treacherous day on the Demon Trail. Weeks later, we ended up crammed together in the back seat of a car hitchhiking toward the Travers-Sabine Circuit, an extended route through the mountains of Nelson Lakes National Park. Circumnavigating Mount Ruapehu, I synced up with a good-natured Kiwi couple for four days. Each night, Jade and Steff kept me company, offering food and tips for the route ahead. Later, they even hosted me at their home in Taupo. Conversation always flowed freely, often focusing on the weather, trail conditions, hut recommendations and the inevitable foreign puzzlement about American politics. Every now and then, we would talk our way through less familiar territory. In the shadow of the Darran Mountains, an ensemble of Kiwis, Americans, Canadians, Aussies and Brits had a lively discussion about their respective relationships to British colonialism. During dinner at Mid-Caples Hut, I confronted my own ignorance when I ate with a man from New Caledonia, a French territory in the South Pacific I hadn’t previously known existed.  I’ll never forget these people. They turned out to be no less central to my New Zealand experience than the Tolkienesque landscapes I originally thought I had come to find. Local resident or foreign traveler, old or young, novice or expert, hut goers have spent their day exploring the wild. At night, their focus tightens to a small room filled with strangers. You share the experience of a common place, even if you come from opposite ends of the earth. The hut makes this happen. Over dehydrated dinners and morning coffee, people open themselves to their fellow travelers and write each other into their common story. As dusk fell on Cameron Hut, I paged through the Intentions Book again. Foreigners and Kiwis alike noted how they had underestimated the steep trail to the hut, but enjoyed the reward of swimming beneath the waterfalls. Some complained about nasty weather. Hunters documented the number of chamois and tahr, exotic species of mountain goat introduced to New Zealand in the early 20th century. Instructions on how to get above tree line covered an entire page, complete with a hand-drawn map. This hut is remote enough that it often sits empty for days at a time, if not weeks during the winter, yet these entries recorded the enthusiasm of its infrequent visitors and their hope that others would experience some of what they themselves had found here.  Wriggling into my sleeping bag, I opened “The Girl on the Train,” knowing that sleep wasn’t far off. In the morning, I would add my own story to the Intentions Book. Then I would tidy the hut, close the door behind me, and head down the trail toward my next night’s shelter. Some heavily trafficked huts, like Great Walks Huts, require advance reservations. Peak season for these huts falls between November and April. Trampers hoping to complete routes like the Milford, Routeburn and Abel Tasman Tracks will need to reserve their bunks up to six months in advance.

By Nell McShane Wulfhart The basketball player Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers is almost as famous for his playful grandstanding as his considerable skills on the court. The 23-year-old, who grew up in Cameroon, has become synonymous with the concept of “The Process,” a strategy for long-term talent building that originated with the former 76ers general manager Sam Hinkie — Mr. Embiid famously punctuates his feisty tweets with the phrase. Currently in his second season with Philadelphia, Mr. Embiid will play in the N.B.A. All-Star game in Los Angeles on Feb. 18.  Mr. Embiid spends much of the year on the road, traveling for games. “Generally, commercial flights aren’t designed to accommodate someone my size — and I get it, there aren’t many people that are 7-foot 2,” he said. “I just don’t feel comfortable since I don’t exactly fit.” Fortunately the team usually travels by charter, which has more room to spread out.  When Mr. Embiid travels, he usually spends his free time on his PlayStation, not partying. “A lot of my teammates party in L.A. and I have a lot of friends in L.A., but L.A. is like the only city. Maybe New York but that’s about it. Other than that, I just want to chill and play video games.” He said he doesn’t get sick of the travel. “We travel a lot, but that’s what I signed up for, so I never complain about it. We get paid a lot of money to do so, so I’m going to live with it, and I don’t think I would ever get tired of it. Sometimes, you miss the food at home, you miss the people around you, but other than that, you should never get tired of traveling.” He’s excited to head to Los Angeles for the All-Star game. “It’s my first time being in All-Stars, so this should be fun.” Is he nervous? “I’m not nervous. You know, I like putting on a show. And I feel like those are the biggest days to do it. That’s my element, so I’m going to have a lot of fun.” Here’s what he takes on every trip. “Everywhere I go, I always have to bring my PlayStation. I’m a big game guy. I play ‘FIFA,’ ‘NBA 2K,’ ‘Madden’ sometimes. Sometimes, ‘Grand Theft Auto.’ Other than that, I play Monopoly and then sometimes I play poker.” “I always have a picture of my little brother that died; that’s always in my bag.” (Embiid’s brother Arthur passed away in 2014 at the age of 13.) “I bring a lot of ChapStick because I lose about a ChapStick a day.” “For basketball, the team actually takes care of it, so they carry our shoes and stuff. But my own personal shoes, sometimes we go on the road for like six, seven days, and that’s when I bring about four or five pairs. I have tons and tons of shoes. I’m signed with Adidas, so I kind of have to wear Adidas. The NMDs, that’s what I wear a lot at the moment. I like them, that’s probably one of my favorite pairs of Adidas. And then when I have to dress up nice, I wear Giuseppes [the designer Giuseppe Zanotti]. I like Guiseppes a lot because they’re flashy — gold and all that.” “I just got a Nintendo Switch. It’s pretty good so I think I might have to bring it everywhere. If I’ve go to go somewhere, and I can’t carry the PlayStation, I can always have the Nintendo Switch.”  “I’m a simple guy so I always have sweats on. Or sneakers with my face on it. I love myself too much.” “I wear this cologne called Baccarat [Baccarat Rouge 540], it’s really good. It’s probably the best I’ve ever had, that’s what I wear a lot. And then I like Creed, I like Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent is pretty good, too, and then Montblanc sometimes. I mix it up every day. Women love when a man smells really good so, you know, I’ve always got to smell good. Every time a woman approaches me, she feels so connected to me because I smell so good.”     Advertisement",3843

By Stephanie Rosenbloom Flight delay predictions, mobile trip-planning, automatic itinerary management, language translation through Bluetooth earbuds, and a smartphone that enables users to learn about landmarks by tapping an icon and aiming the phone at them: These are among the travel innovations Google has been introducing in recent days and weeks. While a Google Pixel 2 smartphone costs upward of $650, the company’s latest tools are free. In fact, they may already be on your phone, nudging Google closer to being a one-stop destination for on-the-go vacation planning.  Searching Google for a hotel or flight was once two separate activities. You could run a search for a flight across multiple airlines. Or you could search a city for hotels. Now, however, when you use an Android or iOS smartphone to search Google for a flight, a hotel or even a destination, you’ll find a blue navigation bar. It appears on your screen when you tap your Google search result — be it “Rome flights,” “Rome hotels” or simply “Rome.” There are separate tabs for flights and hotels (like you see on sites such as Priceline), as well as an “explore” tab to check out the destination’s top sights and best times to visit, and a “your trips” tab where Gmail users can see their future and past travel reservations, and email those reservations to others. (Travelers can also edit their itineraries and see them offline if they use the Google Trips app, which allows users to check out things to do and places to eat; review transportation options; see emergency numbers; and find out about local currency and free Wi-Fi locations.)  With the blue navigation bar, users can now easily move between flight and hotel options. The feature is currently being rolled out on mobile phones in the United States. A spokeswoman for Google said there are plans to expand globally in the coming months. Google has also added new features to Google Flights, its online airfare search and comparison tool. Now users can see what’s included (or not) with new fare types like basic economy. For instance, you can find out whether a particular fare on Delta or United allows you to choose your seat or store a bag in an overhead bin. Users may also be able to find out why their flights are delayed (to check your status, just search your flight number on Google), as well as view predictions about whether a flight will be delayed, based on historic flight status data and machine learning algorithms. (Google said it will share predictions only when it’s at least 80 percent confident of the prediction). These days it’s also possible to book certain flights through Google, as opposed to clicking a link and purchasing the flight on the airline’s website or that of a third-party like Expedia.  While these digital tools are free, they aren’t the only additions that may be of interest to travelers. Google Pixel Buds ($159), Bluetooth earbuds that work with Google Translate on the company’s Pixel 2 phone, offer translation in 40 languages, including Italian, Hindi, Chinese and Spanish. For example, let’s say you’re in a cafe in Provence. You begin by gently pressing the right earbud touch pad and saying, “Google, help me speak French.”  “Sure,” the Google assistant virtual helper will say, “opening Google Translate” (the app must be installed on a Google Pixel phone for this to work). When the waiter comes by, you can touch the right earbud again and say: “May I have a coffee with milk and a glass of water, please?” Google Assistant will then speak aloud on the phone in French what you just said in English. When the waiter replies in French, you’ll hear his words translated into English in your ear. Throughout the exchange, the phone will transcribe the conversation in English and French, enabling both parties to read on the screen the words being spoken.  I’ve been testing the buds for language translation in controlled environments, and the performance has been impressive. Of course out in the real world — where there’s noise and rapid talkers who are not necessarily interested in playing along — results may be different. I’ll be road testing these in other countries soon. Stay tuned.  The buds can be used for other travel-related tasks as well. By touching the right earbud, you can ask for the location of the nearest museum, gas station or McDonald’s. Request directions to a restaurant and you’ll be shown a map and suggested route on your smartphone. Aiming to trip up Google Assistant, I said, “Google, make me a reservation at Nougatine,” referring to Nougatine at Jean-Georges, a restaurant in Manhattan. The assistant replied: “OK, let’s make a reservation with OpenTable at Nougatine at Jean-Georges. For how many?”  “Two,” I said. “Sounds good,” the assistant said. “For two people. For when?” “Tonight.” “At what time?” “7:30.”  “Sounds good. For 7:30. It looks like that time isn’t available. Would 5:30 p.m. work for you?” It would not. But Google Assistant certainly did.  The Google Pixel 2 (starting at $649; the Pixel 2 XL starts at $849) comes with a widely praised smartphone camera. It also has Google Lens technology, which enables users to tap a Lens icon and then point the phone at things such as a landmark, an artwork or a movie poster to learn more, whether it’s about a building’s history, an artist or how a film was reviewed. Lens can also provide this kind of information after you’ve taken a photo.  That said, these are early days for Google Lens, just as they are for the Pixel Buds. Lens is currently limited to popular images: It can identify, say, the Golden Gate Bridge and Mona Lisa, but not necessarily lesser-known objects, making it a fun-to-have feature for early adopters who can afford a premium smartphone, though not yet a travel game changer. Google said it’s working on expanding Lens’ range.  New features were also added to the company’s smart speaker, Google Home, and its siblings, Home Mini and Home Max. Home has long been able to assist with travel by answering aloud the sorts of questions travelers type into Google search: whether they need a visa to visit a particular country, the best time to visit, current weather, currency conversions, how to say “thank you” in another language, as well as flight departure times and traffic conditions. New to that list is flight-price tracking.  Google Home users can begin by saying aloud, “O.K. Google, how much are flights to Hong Kong?” Google Home will then reply with the best current price for the route, ask you if you have preferred dates and if you want to track flight prices for those dates. Say yes and you’ll receive an email confirming that you’ve begun tracking prices for that route. If the cost of the tracked flight significantly changes, you’ll receive an email alert.  This has also been a feature of Google Flights, and indeed those who don’t have Google Home can sign up for route-tracking online instead.

By Jada Yuan Out of 13,000 applicants for our 52 Places Traveler job — for a journalist to go to each and every place on our 52 Places to Go in 2018 list — we chose Jada Yuan. This is her first dispatch. Her next dispatch will be from Chattanooga, Tenn. Follow her trip at nytimes.com/column/the-52-places-traveler and follow her on Instagram @alphajada. On my first trip to New Orleans, eight years ago, I bought a new pair of sneakers. By the end of a week I had danced in the streets so much I’d worn holes through the bottoms of each of them, straight through to my socks. That, more than Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest or oak trees or gumbo, is my indelible image of the city: The only place in the world where I’ve had such a good time that the shoes melted right off my feet.  I’m not a kismet kind of person, but recently I found those sneakers again, on the eve of a trip back to New Orleans that is the start of a complete 180-degree turn in my life. I had just gotten my dream job as the lucky writer who gets to spend the next year traveling to every destination on The New York Times’s annual 52 Places to Go list — and New Orleans happened to be both No. 1 on the list and the first stop of the trip. It’s a thrilling opportunity, and I’ve been a wreck. I had to quit my job as staff writer at New York magazine, where I’ve worked since college; box up my entire apartment; and pack for a year on the road.  I’m pretty sure I was crying when I found those sneakers, because I cried a lot that week. And yet I felt calmer than I had in months. Amid the chaos, it was as if a welcoming committee from the very city where I was starting this adventure had arrived in my living room and handed me a Sazerac: “You got this, girl.”  Tourists can get a bad rap among locals, but we have history with the places we go to and love, too. I’ve spent maybe two months, cumulatively, exploring New Orleans. When I landed at the airport for this most recent visit, I already had a hotel that felt like home (The Columns), a least-favorite popular food (sorry, po’ boy fans), a local institution I recommend to all new visitors (Backstreet Cultural Museum in Tremé) and a favorite leather bar in the French Quarter for getting a cheap 11 a.m. to-go Bloody Mary (Rawhide2010 — though the graphic S&M playing on the TV screens at all times probably isn’t for everyone).  My view of the city is in no way a comprehensive one, but it was molded by my tastes (and by the Anne Rice-loving friend from Brooklyn who introduced me to the city). That’s something that the obsessive reporter in me is going to have to come to terms with, as does any traveler to some degree: Try to do everything and you’ll wind up missing the most magical parts of being far from home. “New Orleans is a feeling,” Angelika Joseph, a singer for the city’s only all-female brass band, The Pinettes, told me while chilling on a sidewalk after a show. “It’s your grandmother’s cooking,” Ms. Joseph, who is known as Jelly, went on. “It’s music, it’s fun, it’s food, it’s partying, it’s a parade all the time.”  That feeling turns 300 this year, which marks the anniversary of when Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville founded the French Quarter. From the sense I got on the ground, though, the tricentennial ranks pretty far below Mardi Gras as a thing the city is excited about. Already on St. Charles Avenue, where I was staying, ladders were set up for the purpose of viewing parades that were two weeks out, and strings of beads from years past were dripping off every oak tree like moss. “We’re so cool, even our trees have bling,” I overheard someone say.  Many people I talked to didn’t even know the 300th was happening. “Should I be excited about it? I guess I’m part of this 300 years celebration in that I was born and raised here, and I’m 54, so of that 300 years I’ve got half a century,” said Curtis Walker, an Uber driver who loves music and recommends the late-night club Seal’s Class Act. “I mean, I’m not getting no money from it. But maybe I’ll get a lot of rides.”  Still, 300 years is a significant milestone for a city that often seems to be at risk of sinking into the sea. That it was so very nearly lost 12 years ago during Hurricane Katrina — or that there’s another one coming — is not lost on residents, who defend their home turf with fierce pride. I experienced that pride a bit when I wrote something offhand on Twitter about how locals were ending conversations by telling me to “be safe,” and that I got the impression that no one walked around after dark. It was a badly worded tweet, though not entirely off base. People were indeed telling me to be safe. New Orleans has a notorious violent crime rate, one that predominantly affects black men, but that sometimes spills over to tourists and residents. (Solo women travelers, as always, should exercise extra caution, no matter the outcry of locals.)  But the city also has, I’ve learned, a very forgiving spirit. The same people who sent me angry messages had turned warm within minutes. One woman I met at the Pinettes show, Renee Lapeyrolerie, wrote me, “Badly worded, not a crime, just a sin lol enjoy the rest of your stay,” and then advised me to put my phone in a zip-lock bag in case it rained. The city is certainly in the midst of a post-Katrina upswing, with plenty of new dining and drinking spots (the St. Roch food market, Latitude 29, for instance), but there are still boarded-up houses in many neighborhoods and a kind of lingering sadness about the hurricane’s most lasting impact, which was a loss of community. Almost every New Orleans native I met told me about friends and family who fled flooded homes and have yet to be able to return.  Among residents’ other regular complaints are the roads, which often seem to be more pothole than concrete, and the water quality, which had much of the city on a “boil water” advisory (including for bathing) due to frozen pipes just days before I arrived. At the satirical Krewe du Vieux, the first major parade of Mardi Gras season, most floats were rebukes of the Sewerage & Water Board, whose failure to maintain drainage pumps resulted in damaging floods this summer. (Other targets were President Trump and the celebrity chef John Besh, who stepped down from his local restaurant empire in the wake of sexual misconduct accusations.) What is thriving is the arts scene. There are, of course, world-class art museums, the slavery-themed Whitney Plantation Museum, and the international arts fair Prospect 4 (which ends on Feb. 25), not to mention the wig artists at Fifi Mahony’s in the Quarter. But it’s school-level performing arts where the most exciting work is taking place. I got a chance to visit ReNEW Cultural Arts Academy, a public arts magnet middle school in Irish Channel, as their marching band got ready for Mardi Gras. They were as impressive as any professional musicians you’ll find on Frenchmen Street. “A lot of these kids, their parents weren’t in a band because of the migration to other states,” said Tenell Moore, the band director. “So we’re building new ‘bandheads,’ what we refer to them in New Orleans. We’re pushing hard to get it back.” It’s working. Out in the Seventh Ward at a booming local spot called Bullet’s Sports Bar, with no other businesses in sight, the Pinettes played to a packed Friday night house that included the New Orleans funk legend Mac Rebennack, better known as Dr. John. “My friend said, ‘Come out and hang out with some sisters,’ and I couldn’t believe how many white people are here. I was like, ‘I’m going home!’” he said. “Forget it, the Pinettes are the real deal. Overlooked way too long in New Orleans, maybe because they’re women.” The group was formed at St. Mary’s Academy, an all-female high school, and in 2013 won the Street Kings brass band competition. (Event organizers had to take a marker and cross out “Kings” and write in “Queens.”) Natasha Harris, the saxophonist, told me that none of them are full-time musicians: “We all have families, we all have jobs, we’re college-educated women, but we do this because it’s our passion.” They often have to perform without their full roster because there aren’t enough women instrumentalists around to act as substitutes for members who can’t make certain gigs. “Our hope,” Ms. Harris said, “is that middle school girls will come up and continue their passion, or that women will see us and realize it’s never too late. Pick that horn back up, keep it going.”  Elsewhere, on St. Claude Avenue, I met another group of women at a nonprofit called Dancing Grounds who are trying to spread the empowering message of twerking. Jazz Johnson, who teaches a class called Twerk Party, moved back after years of dancing professionally in New York City, because she wanted be a corrective for a school system that stopped nurturing the arts after Katrina. “The kids, a lot of the ones I work with, they’re failing and all they keep doing is drilling them and giving them tests,” she said. “You take out the arts, it’s like, where’s the passion?”  The city’s true currency, though, will always be its people, and while this may sound like lazy reporting, I found no better way to meet New Orleans natives than by riding in Lyfts and Ubers. In a predominantly service economy, ride sharing has become one of the most desirable jobs. “When Uber came to town, I fell in love with it,” Curtis Walker said. He had worked as a cook in a hospital (the city’s other thriving industry) and after a week of driving had doubled his take-home pay. He quit immediately.  In contrast to New York, every person I said hello to on the street not only said hello back, but also stopped and wanted to talk for a while: “All right, Miss Jada. Be safe.” One evening, walking in the Garden District, I happened upon George Kapowich, a white retired college professor, having a chat on his porch with Alfred W. Wesley, Jr., a black retired gardener who used to work for him. “One of the things that every newcomer says when they come here is, ‘Everybody talks to everybody here,” Mr. Kapowich said. “Race, age — none of that matters.”  “True dat!” Mr. Wesley said. “You’ve been knowing me 35 years. Serious!”  Another day, I went to the historically black neighborhood of Tremé and came upon Marion Colbert sitting on a bench by her door. Known as Miss Mary, she turns 90 in July and told me that every year the neighborhood throws her a birthday party in the street. “I can’t walk like I did no more. I got diabetes, arthritis and glaucoma, but I’m happy,” she said. “I can still see and talk to people. I don’t need millions.” Every once in a while, she would call out, “You have a nice day, honey,” to whomever happened to be passing by.  “Thank you, have a beautiful day,” one woman replied.  “Oh, it is,” Ms. Colbert replied.  The night of Krewe du Vieux, I got to take one of my Lyft drivers, Michael J. Hill, to an after-party at The Pearl, a kitschy underground event space in the Marigny district filled with all manner of odd objects, including a sculpture of a full-size ostrich. Mr. Hill, who “just made 50,” as he put it, is a traveling barber when he’s not driving share rides, and wanted to pick me up on his tandem bicycle, until it got two flats on the way to the parade. He walked into the party and made quick friends with a woman wearing nothing but a clear shower curtain and a thong, plus other costumed folk, almost all of whom were white. “You’re learning about New Orleans,” he told me. “I’m learning about this for the first time!” Then he had to go home, because the next day was Sunday and he’s a church elder.  Right before I left for New Orleans, my father, a Chinese scientist who lives in New Mexico, where I grew up, emailed me scanned pages from a guidebook called “Roadfood” by Jane and Michael Stern. It included definitions of terms like jambalaya and étoufeé, just in case I didn’t know what they were. It was a very “my dad” kind of thing to do. My whole life, he’s listened to zydeco music and tried to perfect cooking catfish. He introduced me to the 1986 thriller “The Big Easy,” when I was far too young for it. This month, he told me he’s never been to New Orleans, which broke my heart. He works hard, has rarely had a vacation longer than 10 days, and just never made the time. My new dream is to take him once my crazy year is complete.  I won’t be bringing those sneakers, though. I threw them out.

By Ratha Tep Doubles from 165 pounds (about $233) The 42-room, four-story Bristol Harbour Hotel & Spa provides a dose of 21st century chic to Bristol’s Old City and its stately Victorian and Georgian facades. The British-based Harbour Hotels has turned two ornate bank buildings, including one inspired by a 16th century Venetian library, into stylish accommodations (it opened in late 2016). Public spaces now burst with vibrant colors and exuberant modern design set against a backdrop of curving stone walls and intricately carved friezes that are more than a century old. The property is in the heart of the cobblestoned Old City just opposite St. Nicholas Market and its bustling glass-covered arcade, along with lots of restaurants, bars and night life. Most of Bristol’s main attractions are within a 20-minute stroll, including the massive ocean liner-turned experiential museum S.S. Great Britain, the local history museum M Shed, the Wills Memorial Building, and two works of street art from the city’s most notorious son, Banksy. We had booked a Superior Double, the lowest tier available, but got upgraded to a Deluxe Double, the next tier up. At 323 square feet (32 square feet more than a Superior), it was surprisingly roomy. The comfy king-size bed had a tall tufted headboard, and was topped with a fluffy white duvet, a tan and gray coverlet and plenty of pillows. Matte gold reading lamps flanked the bed, as did a wooden writing desk and nightstand. There was a burnt orange velvet sofa at the foot of the bed, as well as a brown leather armchair with a seat cushion upholstered in a bold floral-patterned fabric. The complimentary gin and sherry, in mouth-blown glass decanters, along with crystal glasses, were a nice touch. But despite a double-set of windows and heavily lined drapes, we could still hear the faint bass beat of a nearby club going late into the night. The bathroom, entered by a set of double doors, was amply sized, with a bathtub and separate, spacious stall with a rainfall showerhead. There was an extra-wide sink and plenty of marble counter space. Numerous thick white towels hung from a heated rack, and plush white bathrobes were also provided. High-end toiletries by the White Company were scented with notes of rose and jasmine. Situated in the former bank vaults underground, the hotel’s small spa offers a hydrotherapy pool, sauna and steam room, free for guests, while treatments such as hot stone massage, are extra. The next-door gym is well-equipped with treadmills, exercise bikes, weight machines — and an original bank vault door. The lobby-level restaurant, the Jetty, is decorated in shades of blue, a reference to both Bristol blue glass, once produced throughout the city — it forms a decorative border around the room’s extra-large windows — and the sea, which inspires much of the menu. Addictive, lightly floured cockle “popcorn” arrived hot and crisp in a miniature copper pan, and lobster bisque topped a creamy cheese soufflé. The stylish Gold Bar served creative cocktails like the Clear and Breezy, a fizzy, zesty twist on the classic Dark ‘n’ Stormy. Our lush breakfast, ordered up to our room, included delicious grilled kippers with caper beurre noisette, and toast accompanied by butter served in a scallop shell and a selection of Wilkin & Sons jam and honey. Unfortunately, it took an agonizing 50 minutes to arrive. The Bristol Harbour Hotel & Spa offers plush accommodations and high-gloss design in an Old World setting, conveniently located near many of the city’s main attractions. Just make sure to bring earplugs. Bristol Harbour Hotel & Spa, 55 Corn Street, Bristol, England. bristol-harbour-hotel.co.uk Advertisement",3841

By Shivani Vora If you love horses, barbecue, and live music, one of the world’s largest livestock shows and rodeos, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, is happening from Feb. 27 to March 18 at NRG Park.  The event, which began in 1932, welcomed more than 2.61 million visitors last year. According to Joel Cowley, the president and chief executive of the event, visiting the grounds is a fun experience for all, with plenty to offer to people who aren’t traditionally interested in agriculture or rodeo events.  “Anyone from little kids to great-grandparents can have a good time because there is such a diverse lineup of activities,” he said.  Admission to the 300-acre event grounds is $15 per day for adults and $5 for children between the ages of three and 12. Admission to the daily rodeo and concert in NRG Stadium, one of the park’s main venues, starts at $18 and includes entry into all other activities on the grounds. Admission is free for children two and under.   For more information and to buy tickets, visit the show’s website. Here’s a sample of what visitors can look forward to. Mr. Cowley said that the daily rodeo performances in NRG Stadium, which seats more than 72,000, are the highlight of each day. Over 300 cowboys and cowgirls from around the world compete in a series of rodeo sports including bull riding, where competitors attempt to ride a bull for eight seconds and barrel racing, a speed event where women ride on a horse around a barrel pattern.  The two-hour rodeo performance is followed by a one-hour concert from a notable band or musician. This year, country musicians Garth Brooks, Blake Shelton, Luke Bryan and the pop band OneRepublic are among the performers.  Each day, all day, NRG Center, a 1.3 million square foot building adjacent to the stadium, will host a livestock show. Visitors can see about a dozen species of animals including cattle, pigs, llamas and sheep, and there’s an area where they can watch chickens hatch and calves, lambs and baby pigs being born.  The building also has a retail area where vendors from around the world sell Western-themed goods such as clothes, boots, jewelry, furniture and art.  NRG Arena will also host several horse shows a day. “These are fast paced events that are thrilling to watch,” Mr. Cowley said. Onlookers can expect multiple events demonstrating each rider’s prowess and the stamina and strength of the horses. One example is mounted shooting, where cowboys and cowgirls ride past balloons lined up on a stick and shoot into them with a blank rifle. The winner is the person who shoots the most number of balloons in the least time. The event also features a wine garden, which will be open daily. Visitors here will be able to buy small tastes, full glasses and bottles of around 50 wines from around the world and can imbibe while listening to live music performances from local bands.  Always an attraction for children, the carnival, open all-day, has more than 50 rides including an observation wheel, two Ferris wheels and several roller coasters. When you (or the kids) get hungry, hit the many food vendors selling fried foods on a stick such as smoked and fried turkey legs or fried cheesecake.  Several properties in Houston offer packages themed to the livestock and rodeo, ideal for out-of-towners or locals looking to make a vacation out of the event. Hotel Derek, near the city’s Uptown entertainment district and seven miles from the livestock show and rodeo, has an All Roped In Package inclusive of accommodations, a Southern inspired breakfast, valet parking and a welcome amenity of locally smoked beef jerky and a jar of honey roasted Texas pecans. Prices from $159 a night.  Another option is the Rodeo Houstonian Style package at The Houstonian Hotel, Club & Spa, situated in the heart of the city and about a 20-minute drive from the event; it includes accommodations, two Texas-themed cocktails at the hotel’s bar, a welcome amenity of a charcuterie board, a $50 Uber gift card, valet parking and a boot shine. Prices from $289 a night.  Advertisement",4230

Here’s how to get a good workout, on the go. By Shivani Vora Think you won’t have time to exercise on your next vacation? Not according to Annette Lang, a New York City-based certified personal trainer. “You can actually maintain and even improve your fitness level when you’re on the road,” she said. “And, you don’t have to bother with a gym to do it.” Ms. Lang naturally has plenty of tips on how to get some exercise while you travel. Here are some of the ones she offers her clients when they tell her they’re leaving town.  Think about how you can include some activity on each day of your getaway, Ms. Lang said. If you’re in an urban destination that has a bike share program, for example, consider renting a bike for an hour or two, and take a ride along a waterfront or other scenic part of town.  When visiting sites with scenic viewpoints at the top, such as on the observation deck of a building or the roof of a cathedral, climb the stairs to the top, if that’s an option. Even a few minutes of stair climbing will boost your heart rate, and you’ll be rewarded by great views at the end of your journey.  And, if you’re hiking or exploring a local park, throw in a little exercise by doing 10 step-ups to a bench followed by 10 push-ups, and repeating the set at the next three benches you pass by. “This quick workout burst goes a long way in keeping you fit,” Ms. Lang said.  Discovering your destination on foot is the ideal way to get an authentic sense of place and be active at the same time. Ms. Lang loves to design her own walking tours whenever she’s on vacation. “I make a list of the attractions I want to see and look at a map to find the best walking route that will hit them all,” she said.  On her recent trip to San Francisco, for example, Ms. Lang started her day at a popular breakfast joint, hit two museums, visited Fisherman’s Wharf and ended the day at several bars. All told, Ms. Lang logged more than 10 miles through the hilly city, and took in plenty of sights at the same time.  Take five minutes in the morning on each day of your vacation to do a high-intensity workout. “You’ll burn calories first thing and also feel energized for the rest of the day,” Ms. Lang said.  Plenty of high-impact workouts that don’t require equipment are available for you to follow along online. Do a quick web search or visit YouTube for ideas, or drop by your hotel’s gym, if it has one.  Alternatively, try the following workout from Ms. Lang: 20 push-ups, 20 squat jumps (where you go into a deep squat and jump up toward the sky as high as you can) and 20 burpees (where you jump up toward the sky, come down into a squat, kick your legs back behind you and then come back up). Repeat three or four times or until you’ve been moving for at least five straight minutes.  Whether it’s to buy tickets for a popular attraction or cue up to board a tour bus, waiting in line can be an inevitable. Instead of passively standing and waiting, however, Ms. Lang suggested using your time to do three exercises that your fellow bystanders won’t notice: calf raises, which strengthen the lower legs, glute squeezes, where you tighten your glutes and hold as long as you can before releasing, to tone your backside, and belly breathing, where you exhale as you pull your stomach in and keep inhaling and exhaling while pulling it in more, to boost core strength. You might garner some odd looks, but the result will be worth it.  Advertisement",3594

By Sarah Khan In South African parlance, things happen at two speeds: “Just now” — which could be anywhere from 10 minutes to two weeks to who knows when — or “now-now,” which means, well, now. Judging by the pace at which Johannesburg is evolving these days, you need to get there now-now. The City of Gold originated as a dusty mining center; though it might not have the natural majesty of coastal Cape Town in its court, beneath Johannesburg’s grit there’s a kinetic urban energy: Big-money deals are made in the metropolis’s financial hubs and creative collaborations are unveiled in quirky arts-centric enclaves. While travelers en route to places like Kruger National Park or Cape Town and the Winelands have long treated Johannesburg as an in-and-out stop, many are finally discovering that there are plenty of reasons to extend stays and find out what this lively city is all about. Large parts of Johannesburg’s city center can still feel gritty — urban decay led to many companies abandoning downtown in favor of the newer financial hub of Sandton in the 1990s. But while crime remains an issue, recent years have seen locals reclaiming their inner city. Historic neighborhoods are being revitalized at breakneck speeds, luring citizens back to streets lined with iconic architecture, much of which dates to the city’s late-19th- and early-20th-century origins as a gold-rush boomtown. Explore them while on a walking tour with Past Experiences. Depending on which itinerary you spring for, a knowledgeable local guide (some of them are also artists, musicians and historians) might lead you through neighborhoods like Chinatown, Ferreirasdorp, Newtown, Braamfontein or Fordsburg, directing your attention to easy-to-miss landmarks or sharing the inspiration behind vivid street art installations. Stops could include Nelson Mandela’s former office, or a little-known mine-shaft museum 100 feet below the Standard Bank headquarters. Private tours are 100 rand, or about $8.25, for up to three people; scheduled group tours range from 180 to 400 rand. Most of South Africa’s culinary accolades go to restaurants in Cape Town and the Winelands, but Johannesburg chefs have lately been stepping it up in a big way. Case in point: Urbanologi, a stylish restaurant that shares its cavernous, industrial space with the Mad Giant Brewery in the 1 Fox development. There, the chef Jack Coetzee turns out modern, Asian-inspired shared plates like yakitori chicken with chimichurri, venison tataki with sriracha emulsion and kumquat ponzu, and a ginger-heavy take on a classic South African dessert, malva pudding. Plan to spend around 600 rand for two, including house brews.  Johannesburg’s music scene is electric — whether you’re into house, rap or indie, you’ll find your niche here, infused with plenty of local flavor. But with jazz greats like Hugh Masekela, Thandi Klaasen and Jonas Gwangwa having started their careers in the city, Johannesburg’s jazz heritage is particularly rich. Head to the Braamfontein district — often called Braamies by locals — to see who’s performing at Orbit, the city’s most important jazz club. Recent acts have included the Linda Sikhakhane Sextet, Vuma Levin, Lu Dlamini; tickets typically range from 100 to 150 rand, depending on the artist. For many, South African history is synonymous with apartheid, the oppressive institutionalized system of white-dominated racial segregation that governed the nation from 1948 to 1991. An 85-rand admission fee to the Apartheid Museum will randomly assign you a blanke (white) or nie-blanke (nonwhite) ticket, and you’ll enter the museum through separate routes depending on your classification. Once inside, visitors tour powerful exhibits on the origins of apartheid, explanations of its divisive laws and photographs and narratives that offer glimpses of life under its constraints. Then take a cab to Constitution Hill: The country’s Constitutional Court was built on an erstwhile jail site (where Nelson and Winnie Mandela, Joe Slovo and Albertina Sisulu all served time). It’s also a museum, and visitors can explore the court, the old fort and jail Number Four, where Gandhi was a prisoner. A one-hour tour is 65 rand.  To market, to market — that’s where locals go to eat, drink and unwind on the weekends. Neighbourgoods, an offshoot of a popular Cape Town market, operates every Saturday morning from a parking garage in Braamfontein. Make a quick stop, hopping from stall to stall to pick up dishes like grilled cheese with maple bacon, Korean corn dogs or carrot cake — you can have brunch for around 100 to 150 rand, all the while soaking in live music and fun vibes. Soweto — an acronym for South Western Townships — was formed as a settlement for black South Africans who were forcibly removed from areas designated for whites. It’s now called home by more than a million people, and has counted the likes of Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu among its past residents. While the sprawling suburb can be overwhelming to navigate, an easy way to explore it is by tuk-tuk. Lebo’s Soweto Backpackers offers two-hour rickshaw tours, and you don’t have to be a guest at the hostel to book a spot; tours are 460 rand, and pick up and drop off can be arranged for an extra cost. The price also includes a buffet lunch after the tour — you might try South Africa’s famous street-food favorite, bunny chow: a loaf of bread stuffed with curry. A stretch of the upscale Rosebank suburb has recently been recast as the Keyes Art Mile, lined with boutiques, galleries and cafes aplenty. Stop by before dinner to browse modern art at galleries like Circa, Everard Read and Whatiftheworld (some close earlier on Saturdays, but you can often make an appointment in advance to visit outside regular hours). There are also cute cafes, like the colorful vintage-Afro-chic Milk Bar and the burger joint BGR, but save your appetite — big dinner plans lie ahead.   Ever since its opening in 2016, Marble has been attracting the city’s most discerning diners by the droves. Part of that might be because of a dearth of restaurants of its caliber in the city; but more likely it’s because David Higgs is Johannesburg’s premier chef, and news of his plans to open a temple to meats cooked over an open fire was met with excitement. If you come early enough to the top-floor space in the Trumpet building on the Keyes Art Mile, you can catch sunset views with a cocktail by the bar; afterward, settle in for a feast of sea bass with orange and leek sauce (285 rand), tandoor quail with charred sweet potato chutney, coriander yogurt (215 rand), or the game of the day (options might include blesbok or kudu). More markets! The Maboneng Precinct is one of Johannesburg’s most thriving examples of urban revival; the ever-expanding neighborhood is teeming with galleries, restaurants and boutiques frequented by an eclectic crowd. And come Sunday, the Market on Main is a great place to scrounge for burgers, paella, crepes, and more as well as souvenirs — there are stalls selling clothes, handbags and T-shirts from local designers. For a really cool add-on, book a Picnic in the Sky. Meet in the market at 11 a.m. and collect your picnic basket and blanket from the organizers, then spend half an hour filling your basket with provisions at the stalls, before heading up to the 50th floor of the Carlton Center — the tallest building in Africa — for exactly what the name suggests: a picnic in the sky. Tickets are 250 rand per person, not including whatever food you pick up at the market.   The University of the Witwatersrand — Wits, for short — is home to the Wits Art Museum, which is renowned for its collection of African art. Browse works by the likes of South African masters Gerard Sekoto, Walter Battiss, Irma Stern and William Kentridge, as well as emerging talents like Gabrielle Goliath, Nandipha Mntambo and Zander Blom. Admission is free. An eco-friendly spread in the suburb of Melrose — not far from the Melrose Arch shopping development — the Peech Hotel (61 North Street, Melrose; 27-11-537-9797) has 16 rooms clustered around a lush garden. Tribal masks, animal-hide rugs and patterned armchairs add warmth to the hotel’s industrial-chic look. Doubles from 3,350 rand.  With Johannesburg’s inner city booming in recent years, the only thing missing was a luxury hotel catering to high-end travelers not keen on staying in the tony suburbs. Last year’s opening of the Hallmark House (54 Siemert Road, New Doornfontein) changed that: The 46-room hotel, which occupies two floors of a building designed by David Adjaye, has stellar skyline views and is close to all the action in the Maboneng Precinct. Doubles from 940 rand. Advertisement",8931

By Grace Banks For Londoners in the know, the must-do culture activity last summer wasn’t a major exhibition or a West End show. No, it was an art installation commissioned by the arts organization Bold Tendencies — a stairwell of an old car park in Peckham, South East London, painted a bubble gum pink by the London artist Simon Whybray. The pink space was the cultural hit of the year and drew crowds from all over England. “I had no idea it would be this popular,” said Hannah Barry, founder of Bold Tendencies and owner of the gallery, about the installation. The staircase leads to the top of Frank’s Campari bar, one of the city’s most fashionable drinking spots for London’s cool kids and bankers alike. Among the Caribbean grocery stalls selling mango and plantain, pawnbroker shops and acrylic nail salons of Peckham, beats the heart of London’s most dynamic art scene. Far from fringe, the neighborhood is on the circuit of art world bigwigs such as the Tate Modern director Frances Morris, for its combination of art with $1-million price tags and a creative scene that includes craft makers, food and drink. Peckham is now the place Britons go to for counterculture art, with artists, makers and galleries lured to the area by cheap rents and a recently established East London commuter train line connecting the neighborhood to the center of the city. With the recent arrival of the arts space Peckham Levels that puts a premium on creativity within the community by encouraging local artists who were born and raised in South East London to have their studios at this newly opened center, Peckham is set to boom. “Peckham has always been an area where things happened — art schools, squats, parties,” said Rozsa Farkas, director of Arcadia Missa gallery, located under the railway arches in the center of the neighborhood, “but it’s only in recent years that it’s been known for this.” Farkas’s gallery is typical of the area and of its commitment to exhibiting avant-garde art such as the current exhibition Mouth, a video installation that explores gender binaries by New York-based artist Maja Cule as well as exhibitions about marginalized communities, like last summer’s show We Lost Them at Midnight, about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender culture in London. “There’s a spirit to Peckham that you won’t find anywhere else in London,” said Luds van de Belt, site director of the newly-launched Peckham Levels, a 10-story car park that’s been transformed into a studio block for artists. The enterprise, off the neighborhood’s main street, Rye Lane, offers some of the least expensive artists studio in the area — a 12 square feet studio space rents from £260 to £290 (about $340 to $380) per month. Yearly, 10 studios are offered for monthly rents of just £90 to artists with the lowest incomes. The artist and craft maker Anastasya Martynova, who has a studio at Peckham Levels, sees the area as an integral part of her creative process. “I think art as a whole has a tremendous power to unite people and encourage positivity,” she said, “and Peckham is the creative center of South East London. There is a real feeling of optimism for the future, and lots of raw, creative talent.” The requirements for Peckham Levels membership reflect the neighborhood’s deeply-rooted sense of community. You have to be local and 10 percent of membership fees will go back into neighborhood initiatives. Members also have to commit at least one hour a week to volunteering in local projects. “Growing up in Peckham as a teenager around 2008 I remember it having such a bad reputation,” the painter Sani Sani said. “Friends that lived in other areas were genuinely scared to come around. There were art galleries like the South London Gallery then, but it seemed exclusive and nonaccessible to the locals. I think that the arts scene in Peckham has the power to completely change the perception and the narrative of what Peckham is.” In an expensive city like London, it’s getting harder for creative types and artists to find the space and support they need. But arts spaces in Peckham have all managed to survive through an agreement with Southwark Council, the borough authority Peckham is in, that keeps their rents at about half the market rate. For artists like Mr. Sani, who warily eyes the influx of bankers and high earners in the neighborhood, a cap on rents can only be a good thing. “If we can make it so locals like me can create our art here and be able to afford it,” he said, “maybe Peckham does have a hopeful future ahead.” Advertisement",4750

By John L. Dorman After the Philadelphia Eagles won their first Super Bowl title in Sunday’s game against the New England Patriots, all eyes turned to the city’s long-awaited celebratory parade. The parade, which will be held on Thursday, will travel through the heart of Center City, which includes the central business district and neighborhoods including Rittenhouse Square and Washington Square West. Over one million fans are expected to welcome their championship team back to the city and revel in a hard-fought victory. Here are some ways to navigate your trip to Philadelphia for the parade. The parade will begin at 11 a.m. at the intersection of Broad Street and Pattison Avenue in South Philadelphia, heading north through Center City and then shifting northwest along the iconic, tree-lined Benjamin Franklin Parkway to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It will last for about two hours. There are plans for 14 Jumbotrons along the parade route, which will also be barricaded for the entire length. A formal celebration will begin at 1 p.m. in front of the museum, also lasting for roughly two hours. With more than 1.5 million residents, Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania, was home to some of the most pivotal historical events in American history, including the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Second Continental Congress, and enjoys a scenic perch along the Delaware River.  The city boasts an extensive road network, but driving into the city is strongly discouraged on Thursday, especially in Center City, as many roads will be closed and extensive parking restrictions will be enforced. Bicycle lanes along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and Broad Street will be largely closed to the public. If you’re traveling into the city for the parade, the best option is to use public transportation. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA, connects the city and surrounding Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties through a combination of subway, trolley, bus and train services. On Thursday, the SEPTA Market-Frankford and Broad Street rapid transit lines will both have free admission for all riders, and trains will run every 5 to 7 minutes beginning at 5 a.m., with additional service to accommodate the expected surge in ridership. Individual stations are subject to closure on Thursday if crowd sizes overwhelm surrounding streets. Other SEPTA services will continue to charge their regular fares. For fans from the Philadelphia suburbs and Delaware, SEPTA Regional Rail service will only operate inbound trains into the city on Thursday morning, with service becoming outbound-only after the parade is finished. Regional Rail service from Philadelphia will run from 2 p.m. until 9 p.m. Many stations will not be open, and Center City access via Regional Rail will be available at Jefferson Station and the 30th Street Station. Suburban Station will be closed on Thursday, along with the University City and Temple University stations. Only weekly, monthly and one-day passes will be accepted for Regional Rail service. Prepaid one-day Independence passes to access Regional Rail trains will cost $10 and are currently available for purchase. Cash fares will not be accepted on Thursday. Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station is one of the busiest stations on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor, which runs from Boston to Washington. It also is a stop on the high-speed Acela Express service. The Amtrak Keystone Service is also available from Harrisburg, the state capital. Seats are still available on some Amtrak trains, but tickets are very limited. Before and after the parade, enjoy the restaurants and cultural amenities that have always given Philadelphia a charm that can’t be replicated. From John’s Roast Pork to the Institute of Contemporary Art, the city is ready for your visit. For parade updates, including new transit information, fans are encouraged to text ReadyEagles to 888-777, with alerts coming from the City of Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management.

But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico; El Paso and Ciudad Juárez; Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales across the border in Mexico; San Diego and Tijuana; Big Bend National Park and Boquillas, Mexico.  “You’ve arrived,” announced our obliviously cheerful GPS navigator, as my buddy and I stared, white-knuckled and slightly teary-eyed, at a padlocked gate barely illuminated by the headlights of our rented S.U.V. We’d already traversed 9.2 hair-raising miles of a twisty, sandy unpaved road that an early-December freeze had turned into icy slush, our tires shifting side to side, our high beams no match for the pitch-black darkness. And now we were wondering what it was going to be like to spend the night in the car, in a vast, sparsely populated patch of far West Texas. But, after a few deep breaths and a modicum of quarreling, we carefully reversed course and slipped and slid 9.2 miles back to the main road, taking comfort in the jackrabbits playfully crossing our path in a single bound and Don Williams serenading us with “I Believe in You” on the satellite radio (“I don’t believe … that right is right and left is wrong, and north and south can’t get along”). Back on blessed pavement, and this time following the explicit instructions I had confidently ignored, we made our way to Terlingua Ranch, a community nestled in the snow-dusted Christmas Mountains, to a gorgeous rental house (where, incidentally, the heat would malfunction and we’d sleep fully clothed in a 41-degree bedroom, blue with cold and tickled pink to be alive). It’s hard to convey how humbling it is to visit this little pocket of the United States-Mexico border, a place the National Park Service calls “one of the last remaining wild corners of the United States.” Boosters market Texas as a “whole other country,” but the land within and without Big Bend National Park really is. One of the least-visited of the federal park system, Big Bend is four hours by car from each of the nearest international airports, in El Paso and Midland. You have to really want to get here (or live here, which makes you a different breed altogether). And those who do, those inclined to make the long trek to the park and its attendant ghost towns (Lajitas, Study Butte, Terlingua), are seekers of a sort, not entirely unlike the homesteaders and fortune hunters drawn to these badlands long ago. But nowadays the treasures are silence and darkness and undeveloped natural beauty and all those other things that seem to be in short supply of late. If you’re longing for a respite from this era’s relentless beeping and buzzing and yelling and “Dear God, what now?” news alerts, what better place than one with limited cell service and unreliable electricity, where you step outside in the morning and hear nothing but the grumbling of your stomach and the muffled flap of a bird’s wings high above? Big Bend’s dramatic confluence of river, desert, and mountains makes it easy to wax poetic with words like “majestic” and “epic,” and even those fall short. There’s enough in these 800,000 acres for a lifetime of exploring, the tangible result of a landscape that has borne witness to shallow sea and coastal plain and volcanic upheaval. Eons of geological time are visible in everything from the walls of a towering canyon to the dull, dusty stone at your feet that hides the lacy remains of some ancient sea creature. From the grassy banks of the Rio Grande to the cactus-studded expanse of the Chihuahuan Desert to the oak-and-juniper-carpeted Chisos Mountains, Big Bend is a dream for photographers, a paradise for birders (more than 400 species), the promised land for amateur (and professional) geologists. Huge swaths of land are accessible for day hikes and backpacking (200 miles of trails), camping and river trips. More specifically, there’s the Fossil Discovery Exhibit, where you can gaze upon a life-size replica of the skull of a Bravoceratops (“wild horn-face”), pieces of which were unearthed in the park in 2011. At the Boquillas Hot Spring, situated smack-dab against the Rio Grande, you can sink into a 105-degree pool contained by the remnants of an early 1900s bathhouse and dangle an arm over the rock boundary into the swift-moving, considerably colder water as it passes you by on its 1,900-mile journey to the Gulf of Mexico. (Some advice: Decide when you’re going to visit ahead of time, so that you can don the proper attire in advance. There are no changing rooms, and the vault toilets are like something out of “Trainspotting.” I’d like to take this moment to apologize to whichever park ranger found the bra I left behind in my haste to get out of there.) At any location in or near the park, you can simply look to the ever-changing sky, particularly in the evening, when fiery sunsets of pink and orange and dusty blue give way to an unfathomable darkness spattered with a breathtaking bounty of stars, including a clearly visible Milky Way (Big Bend is a stargazing mecca, officially designated by the International Dark-Sky Association); like me, you may have the stupefying realization that this is what the night sky actually looks like. If you do nothing else but motor around in your car, you’ll have a blast. On our various drives, my friend and I spotted a little family of javelina lumbering across the blacktop, a coyote leaping effortlessly over a fence, numerous roadrunners dashing headlong across the pavement, and a golden eagle resting in some creosote along the side of the road, as if patiently waiting to cross. Finally, where else can you, at least for now, cross the border into Mexico in a rowboat? The Rio Grande (or the Río Bravo del Norte, from a southerly perspective) is all that separates Texas and Mexico within the boundaries of the park, winding its way for 118 miles between forbidding canyon walls; making the abrupt southeast to northeast shift that gives Big Bend its name; and changing in color (chocolate milk in one light, celadon in another) and flow (sometimes grande, often pequeño). There’s hardly a more delightful way to pass over a border; on our first of two trips, we had barely rounded the bend of the descending trail from the Boquillas Crossing Port of Entry before a young man in a “Houston Strong” T-shirt was rowing his way across the river to get us in a waterlogged metal boat, the “seats” covered in what looked like bathmats. It’s $10 round-trip for this makeshift ferry, which hauls its tiny load of camera-wielding tourists back and forth all day during official crossing hours. Once on shore it’s up the hill by foot, burro, or bed of pickup truck to a trailer, where your passport is stamped and you’re granted formal entry into Boquillas del Carmen, the colorful, sparsely settled remains of a former mining town. Borders are always porous, particularly the riverine kind, and so it goes for this one. “Maps that split country into zones of topography, climate, vegetation, and such things have much more neatly sweeping lines of demarcation than nature has usually been willing to go along with,” wrote John Graves, Texas’s beloved chronicler of land and lore, and that goes for people too. For decades the Boquillas border crossing was decidedly informal, illegal but never monitored, a conduit for supplies, a lifeline for loved ones residing on opposite sides, a day’s amusement for tourists. But it always was an international boundary and as such subject to the day’s prevailing sociopolitical anxieties. The crossing was shut down in 2002, in response to Sept. 11, and reopened 11 years later, this time with automated passport control. And now looms another threat. In Boquillas proper, the specter of the wall seems to be just that, haunting the dish towels and koozies for sale on every corner, their hand-embroidered wildflowers, roosters, and javelinas accompanied, in slightly crooked letters, by a simple phrase: “No wall.” A succinct “Trump no bueno” was all we got from a congenial gentleman who walked us into town, that and the declaration in small black letters on his white baseball cap: “The border makes America great” (that message brought to you by El Paso’s Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic congressman running against Senator Ted Cruz in November). The people here exhibit a sort of seen-it-all-before serenity, which seems appropriate, as this battle royal is going down a few miles from rock formations whose strata reveal the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, i.e., a visible record of the extinction event 66 million years ago. Existential musings aside, a visit to this village of a few hundred people feels much as it has for years. We perused the blankets and molcajetes at the shop at José Falcon’s, then took a seat on the colorful patio of the adjoining restaurant for cheese enchiladas, clay copitas of sotol and sweeping views of the Sierra del Carmen range (and, incidentally, a fellow skinning rabbits and goats next door). The joy in a trip to Boquillas, other than its old-world charm, is the hospitality of the people, allowing a visitor brief proximity to the kind of community you’d expect to find in a remote, only recently electrified town 150 miles away from the nearest city. At Boquillas Restaurant, the proprietor offered to give us the souvenirs we happily picked out before realizing we had run out of cash (had too many of the excellent margaritas). We promised we’d return the next day, which we did, to find our items waiting for us in a neat pile on the counter. “Here’s a song about building bridges instead of walls,” said singer-songwriter Trevor Reichman, the featured talent the night we visited the Starlight Theatre, Terlingua’s main watering hole and music venue. As in Boquillas, you can walk the length of this onetime mining camp in a couple of minutes. And you’ll meet eccentric locals who possess the same equanimity that comes from living in isolated and unpredictable terrain. You’ll even detect the same age-old tension between insider and outsider, though the boundaries are a little less fraught. This seemed to me best encapsulated by a sign on the door of a nearby shop that trades in rocks and cactuses and sundry dusty things: “Keep investors, hipsters, and trust-fund babies out of Terlingua. Just look at what happened to Marfa.” Of course, right next to that is another sign, this one directing customers to just slide a check or cash under the door if there’s no one minding the store. Out here one ranch flies the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag; next door is “Just Resist.” But it seems, to this outsider, at least, that once again community trumps ideological differences among people who look out for one another and demonstrate a surprising forbearance of city folk unaccustomed to the extremes of weather and limits of technology, city folk who awake night after night to the howling of coyotes and, in the morning, find their prints in the frosty dust outside the door. Over an excellent made-from-scratch breakfast at the Bad Rabbit at the Terlingua Ranch Lodge (“Do you want your grits thick or runny? Eggs soft or hard?”), our server warned us away from an “unimproved” road to a nearby city, because of course we hadn’t learned our lesson from the start of our trip. “You’ll have an adventure whether you plan it or not,” she said, after we regaled her with our back-road brush with death (from embarrassment, likely). She’s right. Heed warnings regarding rapidly changing weather and full tanks of fuel. Follow directions, literal and otherwise, regarding flashlights and high-clearance vehicles, snakes and scorpions. Avoid the entire area altogether during the more temperate weeks of Spring Break and Thanksgiving (or, as our white-hatted friend in Boquillas put it, “the fiesta of the turkey”). Do all that and you’ll have a wonderful experience, against a backdrop of almost inconceivable magnificence, along a stretch of border where, for now, you can climb to the top of a bluff pockmarked with perfectly round mortar holes left by ancient civilizations, look down on the gently moving river, and wave to people on the other side, a stone’s throw away and a world apart.

But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: El Paso and Ciudad Juárez; Big Bend National Park and Boquillas; San Diego and Tijuana; Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales, Mexico; and Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros. We were both headed to the bridge, in her case so she could cross back to Mexico after a long day of work, and in mine so I could eat and drink at one of the places I used to go when people still did things like go across the international bridge to eat and drink. She was an older woman, maybe in her mid-60s, and like so many others she lived in Matamoros and worked in Brownsville. My sister, Sylvia, happened to be back in town teaching a cooking class at one of the local museums where the woman cleaned and today had stayed later than usual to help her pack up. Now my sister was asking me to give her a ride to the bridge. It was late afternoon and once she crossed over she still needed to grab a bus to the other side of Matamoros and then walk the rest of the way home. I had pulled up to the curb expecting her to get in the front seat, but she opened the back door to set her purse and two plastic bags with leftovers down on the seat and then sat next to them. It seemed kind of impersonal, like she’d just hailed a taxi, but then again, she was no one I knew. My sister had told her my name but she kept calling me Cesar, which I didn’t bother to correct. We were just going to the bridge. First she thanked me, then asked if it wasn’t an imposition. “De nada,” I said to let her know she was welcome. It was only a five-minute ride through downtown Brownsville. I glanced into the rearview and mentioned that later I was meeting my sister and brother-in-law and we’d also be walking across the bridge. She didn’t say anything and only shook her head and looked out at the discount clothing stores and fabric shops and shuttered storefronts that make up most of downtown, the remains of the recurring peso devaluation and over the last 40 years customers leaving for first one mall and then another. We were still four blocks from the Gateway International Bridge, but from the signs in the windows — Ropa Para Toda La Familia, Casa de Cambio, ¡Precios Bajos Garantizados! — and the cumbias blaring from stores, you might think we had already crossed over. “I don’t know why you and your sister need to go to the other side, with the way things are,” she told me, referring to the sporadic but stunning violence in the turf war between the Zetas and Gulf Cartel for control of this lucrative drug smuggling route into the United States. “The way things are” also includes the armed robberies, sexual assaults, carjackings, murder, extortions, and kidnappings, the traditional kind with ransoms, and the express type, where the victim is driven to various A.T.M.s and forced to “max out” his bank account, which, depending on the current balance, may take a matter of hours or days. “The way things are” means life with La Maña, as the cartel and, in general, the bad guys are known in Matamoros, according to Dr. Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an expert on border security and author of “Los Zetas Inc.” Maybe the woman had a point. Matamoros is where in 2010, the Mexican Navy killed Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, the Gulf Cartel leader more widely known as “Tony Tormenta,” hailing down bullets and grenades in a squall of violence that lasted over eight hours. Afterward the government announced the official death toll at six, while the media reported it at 47, but people living in the city, like the woman in my back seat, figured there had to be over 100 dead. “With so much danger,” she said, and muttered something about her grandson, already grown, having disappeared without a trace six years earlier. Even though he’d been living on this side of the river, in Brownsville, to her it all seemed to be connected. But the reason she thought we shouldn’t go across was the very reason I had come home to the border, to write about how going across to Matamoros had changed from my childhood in the 60s and 70s, my partying days in the 80s and early 90s, to today when it’s difficult to find anyone in my hometown of Brownsville willing to risk crossing over. There are still those brave souls, like my passenger, who make the trip for work or to visit family, to save money on a dentist appointment, on a prescription, maybe even for lunch, so long as they stay on the main drags and clear out before dark. She crossed back and forth out of necessity, to eke out a living at a job that paid better than one she could find in Matamoros. When I crossed it was to see something I couldn’t find in Brownsville, maybe it was the restaurants and bars, but maybe also because when you grow up here, on the border, at least part of your life and memories exist on that other side. You remember your dad taking you across for your first haircut, buying a case of Joyas and hearing the soda bottles clinking all the way home inside the trunk of the Oldsmobile, attending a wedding in Brownsville and then crossing over for the reception in Matamoros, eating at places like Los Norteños with the cabrito aflame in the front window, and your last night in town at Los Portales with its rustic interior and enormous glass case with the embroidered saddle and sheathed sword, your grilled fajitas and costillas sizzling on the hibachi set atop a rickety orange side table. She wasn’t the first to warn me. “Depending on which way the wind is blowing you can hear the balazos,” Dr. Juliet García had told me of the rapid-fire sound of the gun battles taking place across the border. Until 2015, she was president of the University of Texas at Brownsville, now renamed the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, which stands close enough to the river that police once found a stray bullet that had been fired in Matamoros and lodged itself into the exterior of a campus building. Which is another way of saying that what happens on the Matamoros side of the river, good or bad, tends to wash ashore on the Brownsville side. Part of what’s always made Brownsville an attractive destination is its proximity to Matamoros and South Padre Island, only 30 minutes away. But the sound of the balazos has scared some tourists away, especially Winter Texans, those retirees from the Midwest who drive their motor homes south to spend part of the year in Brownsville and other cities north of here, all close enough to the bridges connecting them to Matamoros and Nuevo Progresso and Reynosa, where the drug war is even more intense. Now a few of the restaurants that tourists and locals might have crossed over for can be found in Brownsville. Some, like Mi Pueblito and Bigo’s, still have their original locations across the bridge, but Mariscos De La Rosa, a seafood restaurant, left for good after 22 years and reopened in Brownsville in 2010. “I didn’t decide to move here, they sent me,” Rodolfo De La Cruz, the owner, would later tell me. I went there because several people had told me La Maña had taken over his Matamoros restaurant, something he preferred to neither confirm nor deny. “I’ll never go back. The ones who have never lived through it don’t know what it’s like.” Along with the restaurants and smaller taquerias have come wealthy Mexican families with the means to relocate out of choice or necessity. Drive the north end of Brownsville, near the country club and other upscale neighborhoods, and you’ll see a minimalist look favored by many Mexican nationals, the box-shaped homes, the symmetrical gardens and ponds, the tiled driveways and queen palms. It makes sense they would escape the danger to live in Brownsville, a city currently listed as one of the safest in the United States, and almost everyone being of Mexican descent and speaking Spanish. Less than two weeks from now, Feb. 22 to 24, Brownsville will celebrate Charro Days, a festival with parades, dances, concerts, regional food and costumes, all celebrating its cultural ties to Matamoros. Back in the day, before security tightened because of Sept. 11 and immigration concerns led to the United States to build the border wall that connects to the bridge, the Grand International Parade would toddle down the middle of downtown and turn onto the bridge where the floats crossed into Matamoros until they reached the main plaza and wound back to the bridge. Charro Days, now in its 81st year, offers some testimony to our roots being deeper and more lasting than the current violence on one side of the river or the shadow cast from an 18-foot high steel beams of the border wall on the other. “This moment will pass, will run its course. It’s part of the ebb and flow of living on the border,” Dr. García reminded me. And she’s right. We forget Matamoros was here 70 years before there was a border, before there was a Brownsville. We forget Matamoros survived Mexico’s War for Independence, the Texas Revolution, the Mexican-American War, the French Intervention, and the Mexican Revolution. We forget Matamoros endures. In the end, my sister, brother-in-law, and I did walk across the bridge, all 700 feet from here to there, and then to García’s, a popular restaurant and bar, maybe another 300 feet from the Mexican Customs office, in an area some people refer to as the green zone. We sat upstairs, by the window overlooking the manicured avenue, and later, three other friends drove across to meet us there. About the only peril we encountered was not being able to hear one another talk because the lounge act was warming up for that evening’s performance, something our waiter was able to remedy by shuttling us off to the dining room. There we ordered another round of margaritas, a las rocas, and our meals. The menu came with the prices listed in pesos and dollars. Someone at the next table had ordered the steak Diane and the waiter flambéed the meal before the table. It wasn’t Los Portales, it wasn’t Los Norteños, it wasn’t where we’d be if we could be where we really wanted to be, but for a moment, we could imagine it was like old times. Two weeks later I asked my sister to help me contact the woman I’d taken to the bridge. Until she sent me her number I still didn’t know her name. I wanted to ask the woman what exactly she’d seen living in Matamoros and if she’d heard anything about her grandson, but she was too afraid to talk, of something happening to her family if they, Los Mañosos, found out, and none of my assurances that her name wouldn’t be printed here could convince her to answer my questions. “Que Dios te bendiga,” she said as she hung up, “May God bless you,” which was the same thing she had told me a couple of weeks earlier when I said we would keep crossing the bridge.",10939

But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico; El Paso and Ciudad Juárez; Big Bend National Park and Boquillas; Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales, Mexico; and San Diego and Tijuana. “You’re trying to kill me.” It wasn’t an accusation, or even a question; just a matter-of-fact observation. My friend Shyema may never have actually been at risk of death, but I was about to find out if it was possible to lose a friend by overfeeding her. I hadn’t intended to test the limits of a 12-year friendship when I proposed a weekend in Tijuana. “It’ll be fun,” I promised. “We’ll catch up. We’ll eat tacos.” I neglected to put a number on how many tacos. Few friendships, or waistlines, can emerge unscathed from Tijuana’s relentless onslaught of delectable street food. Tijuana earned a reputation for violent crime during the 1990s to early 2010s; while crime remains an issue, with rising homicide numbers linked to the drug wars, the main areas frequented by visitors felt safe and easy to navigate. And so Shyema and I focused on our taco crawl. I’d spent weeks researching places to go in the border town, looking for landmarks, historic quarters, museums or pre-colonial ruins to cross off my tourist checklist. But instead, every tip yielded by my Google searches and interrogations of frequent Baja-goers came laden with calories. In Tijuana, the long lines are for taco stands, not monuments. So Shyema and I stepped through a turnstile in San Diego on a Friday afternoon and, with a quick glance by an official at our passports, walked into Mexico. “The truth is, there’s nothing to do but eat and drink,” said Bill Esparza, a James Beard Award-winning writer in Los Angeles, who heads south of the border at least once a month. He’s also a co-owner of Club Tengo Hambre, which arranges culinary day trips throughout Baja California, the state in which Tijuana is located. “For me, it’s a place to relax.” That might come as news to people who still associate Tijuana with cartel clashes and mass executions. But as crime has gone down, tourism has gone up in recent years, and its proximity to Southern California makes it a popular jaunt for Los Angeles and San Diego residents who want to eat and drink well — and affordably — for a weekend, or even an afternoon. It’s also a quick stop on the way to the wine lands of Valle de Guadalupe and the coastal town of Ensenada. Hopping between TJ — as it is commonly known by locals in Mexico and California — and San Diego is a way of life, as residents on both sides of the border crisscross for work, school, medical appointments and night life. Pursuits range from the divey to the thrifty in TJ: American teenagers partying on Avenida Revolución; families stocking up on cheap groceries. If you live in the suburbs south of San Diego and have a Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection pass, which gives preapproved travelers expedited passage, it can be quicker to drive to Tijuana than downtown San Diego. This frequent back-and-forth makes this border crossing the busiest in the world, open 24 hours with 300,000 people passing through each day. My plan was something like this: Walk across the border. Eat. Walk around. Eat. Take an Uber. Eat. Sleep. Wake up. Eat. Repeat. But first, Shyema and I checked into One Bunk, an ultrahip micro-hotel from a binational brand with branches on both sides of the border. This outpost opened last spring in the heart of Avenida Revolución, Tijuana’s notorious main drag. There, above a boisterous strip lined with bars, souvenir shops and “zonkeys” — donkeys painted with stripes to resemble zebras, something of a TJ mascot — we found a sleek nine-room respite filled with retro design references: vintage suitcases, neon signs, a chandelier made from tennis rackets and a painting of Pancho Villa. I eased us into our epicurean explorations with a salad. But not just any salad: Caesar’s, a Tijuana institution since 1927, is purported to be where the Caesar salad was invented, and between that claim to fame and its location at the heart of Revolución, it sees its share of tourists. Our server prepped the dressing tableside, tossing egg yolk, cotija cheese, mayonnaise, garlic, olive oil, and barbecue, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauces in a wooden bowl. He bathed a handful of lettuce and shrimp in the dressing before showering it with more cotija, and Shyema and I shared a plate while watching the madness unfold on Revolución from our sidewalk table. Next, we walked to the kitschy restaurant La Corriente Cevichería Nais and tried the Taco Kalifornia, shrimp and cheese stuffed in a pepper and shrouded in a tortilla, and a Pacifica Tostada, a ceviche of tuna, lemon juice, hot sauce, serrano peppers,and onions. Both were fiery and bright, with flavors hitting my tongue in unexpected places long after I’d taken a bite. Light, flavorful, seafood-focused cuisine is Baja California’s calling card. While the wall between Tijuana and San Diego — an imposing part of the landscape of this corner of the continent long before President Trump made it an issue in his campaign— clearly delineates a separation between the two countries, on the plate, lines are blurred and flavors are fluid. “Baja cuisine is very much like California cuisine,” Mr. Esparza said. “It’s a cooking style that doesn’t adhere to any kind of tradition. It’s 100 percent Mexican, just not bound by any rules.” Cooks in Baja often eschew lard in favor of olive oil from area farms; wines from Valle de Guadalupe and oysters, sea urchin and the large clam geoduck from the ocean are on the menus. And the back-and-forth north to California has inspired chefs on both sides of the wall. San Diego has some of the best Mexican food outside Mexico, and the California city’s booming craft brewery scene has spread south of the border. “The people who have restaurants in Baja, a lot of them grew up going between San Diego and Tijuana,” Mr. Esparza said. “There’s definitely that relationship between these two places.” A Tijuanan culinary stalwart who exemplifies that relationship is Javier Plascencia, whose dining empire has included restaurants on both sides of the border. Shyema and I Ubered from Zona Centro to Zona Rio to eat at Plascencia’s Mision 19, Tijuana’s most elegant restaurant, all white tablecloths and dim lighting in a nondescript office building. Mr. Plascencia grew up in both San Diego and Tijuana and sometimes crosses two or three times a day. “I opened Mision 19 seven years ago, when the city was not in good shape, when everything was happening,” Mr. Plascencia said. “We thought if we open this restaurant, people will want to come and see that Tijuana is not going away, it’s not going to die. It’s going to get better.” The result is a modern celebration of Baja cuisine, the type of place where local residents come to mark a special occasion, perhaps over house-made pasta with octopus, beef fillet picadillo and Mexican chile peppers, or local tuna with cactus, xoconoxtle (a sour cactus fruit), black mole caramel and short-rib chicharron. “Baja California is a young cuisine, not very traditional, and very creative,” he said. “Nobody’s telling us how to cook or what to do.” Over the next day and a half, we raced to sample every place on my list. Throughout the city, tacos were mostly between 20 or 40 pesos apiece ($1 to $2); Uber rides were typically 20 to 60 pesos. Saturday’s first breakfast was at Telefónica Gastropark, a new food-truck trailer park where we tucked into chilaquiles and papas de zefe in outsize portions from La Carmelita. It’s the kind of place that you expect would be overrun by gringo hipsters, but we found locals descending in droves. Brunch was the best sandwich of my life, found, unexpectedly, at a carwash a few blocks away: Tortas Wash Mobile has been plying its tortas since 1964, and a crowd of people hungrily tearing into their sandwiches was huddled around the garish yellow stand. I went around the corner to devour mine on the stoop of a nearby building, inhaling the pile of spicy citrusy carne asada swathed in mayo, guacamole and tomato and nestled in pillowy ciabatta-like bread. A few blocks away I tried the cabeza — cow head — tacos at Tijuana’s so-called “Taco Alley.” Other stops that weekend included Asadero El Nuevo Tecolete, a stand specializing in carne asada; Taquería Franc, a loud late-night spot where locals and tourists alike spill onto the street; La Cahua del Yeyo for stingray and shrimp tacos; a return to Telefonica Gastropark for the ricotta-draped French toast at Azarosa; and Tras/Horizonte, an upscale eatery where I tried the Chicano, a grilled-octopus taco. Shyema lost her goodwill toward me somewhere between the papas and the stingray. But if I was indeed trying to kill her, there are surely worse ways to go than death by deliciousness. Tras/Horizonte is the brainchild of chef Oso Campos, who, as he said, was “born and made in TJ” but who has traveled extensively throughout Mexico and California. “We serve Mexican border cuisine,” he said. “Us as a people, we are a mix of all different cultures and lenguas. Tijuana is a young city trying to find its identity.” The city does seem to have a bit of a split personality: Centro, filled with cheap pharmacies and barbershops and street-food stalls, is gritty, but the landscape of the outlying suburbs is studded with shiny outposts of Costco, Office Max, Sears and IHOP, resembling a not-so-far-flung suburb of San Diego. Most businesses accept dollars, and even Uber has two faces: Riders can opt for Uber English, which guarantees English-speaking drivers at the same price as Spanish-speaking ones. “When I told people I was going to Mexico, they laughed at me,” Shyema said. “They said Tijuana wasn’t Mexico proper.” It is Mexico proper, of course, but Tijuana and San Diego seem to exist in a nebulous nation all their own, one not so easily defined by walls. Tijuana feels like it’s on the outskirts of San Diego because, well, it is; some parts of San Diego, like the Mexican-American enclaves of Chula Vista or Barrio Logan, could be an extension of Tijuana. “They call Chula Vista the nicest neighborhood in TJ,” said Gibran Huerta, a creative director in San Diego whose company has employees in both cities. I’d run into him at One Bunk, which he’d helped design. “When you grow up in San Diego, you grew up with TJ in your life,” he said. “When you live here you don’t really see the border. It’s a crazy cross-border lifestyle for those who aren’t afraid to cross.” On Sunday, Mr. Huerta invited us to crash his group’s breakfast plans. “Go where the people are,” he said, and according to him, that morning the people would be at an unassuming, unnamed cart at the intersection of Avenida C. Niños Heroes and Calle 4ta, which ladles vats of steaming hot birria, a beef stew from Mexico’s Jalisco province. We weren’t even sure if the stand would be there when we arrived, but there it was, doing brisk business at 10 a.m. on a Sunday. Mr. Huerta jostled through the crowd and ordered a round of tacos: heaps of birria encased in crunchy, flaky tortillas unlike any I’ve ever eaten before. “Tijuana is not a picturesque place,” said Mr. Huerta. “There’s a lot to eat, not to see.” Except there is one thing. While the specter of the wall looms large in politics, in Tijuana, it’s been a fact of life since the 1990s. The border wall at Playas de Tijuana is not rhetoric but very real, an imposing slatted barrier 18 feet high that extends into the sea, separating Tijuana from San Diego County’s Imperial Beach. On the Mexican side, it’s a lively scene, with people gathering to walk on the beach, eat fresh coconuts, and take selfies with a wall covered in colorful murals. “Vive Libre Sin Muros.” “Love Trumps Hate.” “Earth Was Not Meant to Have Walls.” And on each side of the wall, families who are separated by deportations and tenuous visa status gather for teary reunions through the barrier. “We’ve been living with the wall all of our lives,” Mr. Huerta said. “Trump saying ‘the wall, the wall’ — it doesn’t make a difference to us.” Shyema and I walked back the way we came, after a 40-minute wait at the pedestrian border crossing — not too bad for a Sunday afternoon. Our stomachs had survived Tijuana, and so had our friendship.",12589

But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico; Big Bend National Park and Boquillas; San Diego and Tijuana; Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales, Mexico; and El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. As I sat at the market in Ciudad Juárez on a weekday in January, it all seemed so familiar: The clanking of the reusable glass bottles; the greeter hollering for visitors to sit in his corner of the restaurant; the smell of grease meandering through the upstairs eatery where Axl Rose was screaming at me from a jukebox. All this while vendors downstairs sold T-shirts with the image of the late singer Juan Gabriel emblazoned across the chest while others negotiated with visitors over the price of a homemade poncho featuring the logo of the Dallas Cowboys. The images of daylong excursions to Ciudad Juárez with my father as a child made their way into my memory, where they collided with the flashbacks of a teenage me sharing buckets of beers with friends who were convinced that going south of the border for a day was more important than sitting through biology. I was one of tens of thousands to cross into Mexico from El Paso that week, challenging the notion that lawlessness in Mexican border cities keeps Americans at bay (but gone are the days of oral declarations; a passport is now required to re-enter the United States as the federal government continues to beef up border enforcement). Even in tougher times, many of us never stopped coming here. It is because there are thousands of El Pasoans like me whose ties that bind them to Ciudad Juárez are familial or economic, or both. The effects reverberate well north of the Rio Grande. Texas is Mexico’s No. 1 trade partner, and the El Paso customs district saw $85.5 billion in two-way trade with Mexico, from January to November 2017. That is the second-highest total in the United States behind Laredo’s $270 billion. In the heart of Ciudad Juárez I crossed the street to where the parishioners from the centuries-old Catedral de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe were walking through the adjacent park, the Plaza de Armas. Guards were closing up shop at the city’s old government office, now the Centro Municipal de las Artes. Both are open to the public, and are just two of the museums and tourist attractions city officials and street vendors hope will lure visitors back to a city considered by lawmakers and human rights groups as one of the world’s most dangerous just six years ago. Two blocks east on Avenida 16 de Septiembre is a museum that captures the spirit of one of the greatest episodes in Mexico’s history, the Museo de la Revolucion de la Frontera. The museum occupies what was the customs building during the civil war that raged in Mexico from 1910 to 1920. Recent renovations have transformed it with a modern sleekness. Photographs of Mexican revolutionary figures like Francisco Madero, Venustiano Carranza and Francisco “Pancho” Villa in different areas of revolutionary Juárez highlight the importance of the city during the war. There is also an emphasis on how the Americans were responsible for some of the mayhem. Such is the case with the exhibition dedicated to Gen. John J. Pershing, who led his so-called “Punitive Expedition” in pursuit of Villa after the Mexican rebel leader led his forces into Columbus, N.M. And although the writers John Reed and Ambrose Bierce are perhaps the most widely known Americans who were fascinated enough by the war in Mexico to become a part of it, the M.U.R.E.F. instead dedicates space to local photographers and writers like Melville Jean Herskovits, Harvey Kiefer and Esther Eva Strauss, whose curiosity and dedication to photojournalism helped document the war for readers in Texas and beyond. After leaving the museum and walking back toward downtown’s Paso Del Norte bridge, I realized there remains a sense of adventure associated with going into Ciudad Juárez, which I assume could still be slightly overwhelming for new visitors. Though violence has decreased significantly, the sight of a federal police truck carrying masked soldiers clutching semiautomatic rifles can still be somewhat jarring to visitors who are not accustomed to it. I spotted two of these conducting routine patrols before my last stop on this day trip: the Kentucky Club. The bar has been in business since the 1920s and was frequented by Americans in need of a beer, whiskey or tequila during Prohibition. It has retained its reputation as a laid-back place for patrons on both sides of the Rio Grande, and was one of the few pubs that didn’t shut its doors during the drug cartel wars that raged in the city from 2008 to 2011. You can stay here for a beer or two, or one of their famous margaritas, or spend hours on end reading about its famous patrons and watching the flat-screen televisions above the hand-carved wooden bar. As the evening wears on, available seats are fewer and the music louder. Farther away from the cathedral and the museums Ciudad Juárez offers up more for visitors willing to take a cab, Uber or drive themselves into the city. Villa del Mar or Los Arcos are just two of the restaurants here that offer affordable seafood dishes. Villa del Mar was a family favorite growing up. The owners opened a branch in El Paso after the drug violence began but the original location is still up and running in Ciudad Juárez. This was my first time at Los Arcos, recommended by a family friend. A delectable dish of bacon-wrapped stuffed shrimp, a beer and a bottle of water was less than 350 pesos, or about $19. Closer to the Bridge of the Americas and Chamizal Park, Viva Mexico! stages a two-hour-long pageant that celebrates everything from Mexico’s indigenous roots to its vaquero culture with song and dance. That follows a buffet dinner that has become so popular that reservations are recommended. Much of El Paso’s identity is rooted in its remoteness. It is in a different time zone than most of Texas. It is closer to the capitals of three other states — Arizona, New Mexico and Chihuahua — than it is to Austin. It is surrounded by mountains and desert that offer few clear distinctions as to where the city in Texas ends and the one in Mexico begins. I was born and raised here. My mom’s house is in the Austin Terrace neighborhood and my father’s house was two blocks from the eastern foothills of the Franklin Mountains, in a part of the city that used to be called Chivas Town (so named because it was where goat farmers lived before the neighborhood was incorporated by the city). After moving away for school and work for a number of years, I realized I had not taken advantage of what the Franklin Mountains had to offer. So when I came back, I set out to explore the hiking trails and mountain peaks my friends brag about on social media during their bike rides and other excursions. The mountains have rugged options for outdoor entertainment—they’re one of the premier spots for paragliding in the United States—and the Wyler Aerial Tramway takes hikers and other visitors to Ranger Peak, 5,632 feet above sea level. From the top, Fort Bliss is visible just beyond the middle-class neighborhoods of Central and Northeast El Paso. The base, one of the largest in the country, is home to the First Armored Division of the United States Army and spreads across Texas and New Mexico on more than a million acres of federally owned land. Its history is on view at the Old Ironsides Museum on the base, which features exhibits about the history of the base and the division, and rationing efforts by Americans during World War II. A plaque next to an Abrams M1 tank honors Sgt. Israel Devora Garcia, who was born in Zacatecas, Mexico, and raised in nearby Clint, Tex. He died in combat operations in Iraq in 2006. (Admission to the museum is free. Visitors must get a pass to the base before entering; it’s easy but can be time-consuming on weekends.) Fort Bliss is one reason so many El Pasoans are so patriotic (one of the city’s main highways, Route 54, was designated the Patriot Freeway during the first Gulf War). Like Ciudad Juárez, El Paso is experiencing its own downtown renovation, which includes the successful return of minor league baseball to the city. The El Paso Chihuahuas, the Triple-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres, who play at Southwest University Park. The nearby Deadbeach Brewery is just one of a half-dozen or so trendy spots that offer up craft beers and food-truck meals (at Deadbeach, I like the I.P.A.). El Paso is as well known for its Mexican food as it is for its mountains. It is not that people claim the enchilada or menudo was invented here, they just believe they are better in El Paso than anywhere else. Exhibit A: the L & J Café, which has been around since 1927. Out-of-towners are quick to say the chicken molé is the best they have ever tried, but for me the chicken enchiladas are second to none. The Tap Bar is what I consider one of the best haunts in El Paso, where it’s hard to tell if it is 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. once you’re inside. The jukebox will go from Los Tigres del Norte or Marty Robbins to Metallica within minutes. In addition to mountains, desert sunsets and the legend of Pancho Villa, residents of both Ciudad Juárez and El Paso have something the rest of the other cities along the Rio Grande don’t: New Mexico. Less than 10 minutes from downtown El Paso is the Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino. On the way there, people cross south of the Rio Grande but remain in the United States. On my first visit I won enough to gamble and drink for free, which wasn’t bad for a lazy Sunday. Because it is on the border, the entertainment doesn’t consist of Elvis impersonators or a tribute to the Rat Pack. It is something with more of a local flavor — a live mariachi band.",10028

But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico; El Paso and Ciudad Juárez;Big Bend National Park and Boquillas; San Diego and Tijuana; and Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales across the border in Mexico. “Please don’t write another story about drugs,” Sigrid Maitrejean, a volunteer guide at the Pimeria Alta Museum inside the old city hall in Nogales, Ariz., beseeched me in a playful tone. It was not the only time during my three-day visit to the region that people would make a similar plea: enough of the endless media stories and political rhetoric about the supposedly dangerous United States-Mexico border, which only serve to keep visitors away. Residents of this town of 20,000 souls wanted me to see the Nogales they see: a place steeped in layers of rich history and culture, which maintains a uniquely special relationship with its namesake and sister city across the border, Nogales, Sonora. And indeed, in the two Nogaleses — or Ambos Nogales, as locals refer to them — I found the most quintessential of all the border cities. I love the concept of twin cities on the border. Maybe it’s because I grew up in one, or because I’m a twin. I love the idea of two worlds that coexist and intermingle, and in fact, depend on each other for survival. The descendant of families that were already living in the Texas border region when the international boundary was drawn up in 1848, I grew up almost in two countries, spending Sundays across the border immersed in the Mexican universe of my abuelitos and tías and primos. We didn’t talk about it like we were visiting another country — we went to el otro lado, the other side. I liked that my sisters and I could choose what we loved about each of our two upbringings, and creatively mix languages and systems of meaning. There are 16 sets of sister cities that line the 1,950-mile United States-Mexico border, and as a journalist who has focused on the region, I’ve experienced all but two of them. While I’d been in Nogales before to report on immigration and the border wall, what I learned on this visit is that calling Ambos Nogales “one town in two countries” may be a slight exaggeration, but it’s a very apt metaphor. And this is what makes it a fascinating place to visit. “This is one city,” Ms. Maitrejean said. “This is one place that was cut in half. That’s essentially what happened.” That explanation is more or less true. In 1841, when the territory was still part of Mexico, a family by the last name of Elías received a land grant from the government it established as Los Nogales de Elías, a name derived from the walnut trees that blanketed what today is known as the Santa Cruz River Valley. The Spaniards had utilized that mountain pass during the previous two centuries when they explored the Pimería Alta, as northern Sonora and southern Arizona were known, west to California, and it’s believed indigenous groups had traveled the same path for millenniums. Nogales, then, has formed part of an important northern migratory route far before the United States became concerned with border walls. The land was not part of the original territory gained by the Americans at the end of the Mexican War, but the United States government acquired it in 1853, through the Gadsden Purchase, to build the southern transcontinental railway line. Foreseeing the boon in international commerce that intersecting railroads could bring, two Russian brothers named Jacob and Isaac Isaacson set up a trading post in 1880, which was renamed Nogales by the U.S. Postal Service soon thereafter. To support the new trade, a community emerged on the Mexican side of the line that people also referred to as Nogales. Unlike the Texas border, however, where the boundary is defined by the Rio Grande, Arizona’s is a land border, and in Nogales, the border was an unobstructed street called International, half of which technically lay in one country, half in another. Around it, a seemingly singular town spread north and south. But managing an international division, it turned out, wasn’t simple. The first fence on the United States-Mexico border went up here — after the Mexican government called for it. The United States government had grown wary after the Mexican Revolution began in 1910, and relations had tensed as each side accused the other of banditry and incursions. The United States set up a military camp in Nogales, Ariz., and General John J. Pershing was dispatched to chase after the Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa. The Sonora governor put up an 11-wire fence, which got torn down four months later. In 1918, after the two cities went to war for a day because an American guard shot a Mexican citizen at the border crossing, authorities on both sides agreed to construct a permanent chain-link fence between them. But as life resumed, the fence became a technicality, not a reflection of how people related across the line. During Prohibition, Mexicans built saloons that straddled the border, so that patrons could drink so long as they were on the correct side of the building. Ms. Maitrejean remembers how this tight-knit existence endured as she was growing up. In the 1950s, a Mexican shop on International Street would put up a huge blackboard to transmit the World Series as nogalenses watched the games excitedly from the United States side. On Cinco de Mayo, city leaders would build a platform over the fence and crowned a binational queen as a joint parade marched across the border. Eventually, migration from other parts of Mexico grew through the area, and stricter United States enforcement followed. “The border crossing was getting more difficult,” said Ms. Maitrejean, “and, of course, once they put up our horrible Vietnam landing-mat fence in the ’90s, that was really the end.” Made of 10-foot panels of corrugated steel that the United States Army had used to land helicopters in the Vietnam War, that was the fence that locals most resented, for it blocked the view they had always had to the other side. Then in 2011, the federal government replaced it with a rust-colored steel bollard fence, encased in cement footing with four-inch slats between the bars. Now, the two Nogaleses could see each other again, somewhat. Soon, families that didn’t have the right paperwork to cross started coming to either side on weekends to catch up with each other across the bollards. Today, Jessy Zamorano, the owner and operator of Baja Arizona Tours, is struck by how her clients, many of whom are from the northeast or Midwest, react when she takes them to the fence. “Women are very much more sympathetic,” she said. “They will look at it, and some find it quite shocking and obtuse. But many of the men say, ‘build it higher.’” When they spot some of the families reaching between steel bars to hug each other, or holding up a newborn baby for their relatives on the other side to meet, she said, “women will frequently cry.” Driving south the 60 miles from Tucson, where the closest commercial airport is, the highway rises thousands of feet as the desert scrublands of the lower Sonoran desert give way to hilly terrain ringed by the Santa Rita, San Cayetano and Tumacacori mountains. The region nurtures some of the best bird-watching in North America and an abundance of wildlife, such as javelinas, rattlesnakes and hawks. There are many activities in the region that can be paired with a visit to the two Nogaleses, including hunting for deer and mountain lion; fishing at Peña Blanca Lake; wine tasting and hiking in Patagonia and Sonoita; and golfing in Tubac, Kino Springs or Rio Rico. A worthwhile stop is the artists’ colony of Tubac, where you can learn about the Spaniards who first explored the region at the Tubac Presidio State Historic Park and nearby Tumacacori National Historical Park, as well as hike or ride a horse along the same trail that Juan Bautista de Anza traveled by foot with 240 women, men and children on his 1,200-mile journey to establish the first nonindigenous settlement at San Francisco Bay. But in my view, as a lifelong student of the border, the cultural treasure is Nogales itself. Here, the kind of tourism you’re doing changes, and you train your eye and ear to catch things you wouldn’t see or hear in other parts of the country. In Nogales, I heard perfectly bilingual speakers mix Spanish and English more as an artful form of expression than a linguistic deficiency (“le pide a la señorita que nos traiga un sautéed spinach?”). Almost everything is bilingual and international. Twice, I assumed that individuals with fair skin and Anglo last names were white, only to learn they had at least one Mexican parent. I met Mexicans who had dual citizenship and owned homes on both sides of the border, and white residents who spoke excellent Spanish. The Paul Bond Boots shop that has made the traditional custom boots of classic Western films is staffed by Mexican craftsmen. “I sit here every day and I marvel at it. I totally do,” said Nils Urman, the executive director of the Nogales Community Development Corporation. A native of Germany, he married into a local family in the late 1970s. “I think it’s the most fascinating thing I’ve seen in my life, and I’ve been here 38 years.” And there’s more diversity in the city than American and Mexican, he said. “This community’s got French, it’s got Irish in it, it’s got Greek in it, and they’re on both sides of the border.” Economically, Nogales today still thrives on international commerce. It depends on the logistics and transportation services industry that supports maquiladoras in Sonora and on the import of produce, which makes up half of the Mexican vegetables and fruits consumed by Americans. It also relies heavily on Mexican consumers — Nogales, Sonora, has 450,000 residents to its 20,000 — and those shoppers are coming over less and less. Mr. Urman said annual pedestrian crossings into Nogales, Ariz., have dropped to 2.7 million from 7.7 million in the past 10 years. John Doyle, the mayor, said various factors have led to the decline, including the devaluation of the Mexican peso and increased wait times at the ports of entry because of heightened border security. Still, he said, President Donald Trump’s talk of building a longer and heavier border wall is of less concern to him and the mayor of Nogales, Sonora, than his roiling against international trade. “We’re more worried about where the Nafta agreement’s gonna end up, you know?” he said. “But even so, everybody’s getting creative and looking ahead in case of it. Everybody’s working harder.” On the other side of the dividing line, the steel fence gives way to a protest of walls and borders. The government has permitted some local artists to put up creative works that make bold statements, while others have informally drawn on it with spray paint. One piece, titled “Paseo de Humanidad” (“Parade of Humanity”), features a procession of extraterrestrial-looking steel figurines marching toward the border with emblems on their bodies that evoke the economies that drive people to migrate (one figure is made of maize, and another bears an “Hecho en Mexico” stamp, possibly alluding to the maquiladora plants that displace people from their home regions). Another installation consists of 60 small wooden crosses that lean against the fence, each one symbolizing a migrant who has died crossing the border. One painting, which makes a haunting image at night when the streetlights reflect the wall’s bars onto the street below it, simply shows the boyish face of a teenage boy. It memorializes Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, a 16-year-old who authorities say in 2012 was throwing rocks to distract Border Patrol agents as two males tried to drop back down to the Mexican side of fence after smuggling bundles of marijuana. One of the agents shot through the fence and killed the young man on Mexican land. The border and its themes naturally infuse some of the artistic production of Nogales, Sonora, because of the way it shapes the artists’ daily lives, said Elena Vega, a local poet and photographer who also experiments through painting, dance, music and spoken word. “In the art world, it’s always like that — some people live over there and come play here, or else we go and present our work over there,” she said. “So, it’s a coming-and-going. Maybe my work has that essence, but it’s not that I’m looking for it. It happens, it emerges from the work.” While Mexico, like the United States, sometimes looks down upon its border cities, Ms. Vega said it is creative precisely because it’s a fluid, heavily traversed zone. “I think it’s the border environment. There’s more openness, it’s more diverse.” Even as downtown Nogales, Sonora, also struggles to remain vibrant with fewer Americans crossing over, the rest of the city is thriving, seemingly growing by the day and producing not just art, but a new gastronomic culture, said Alex La Pierre, the program director for the Border Community Alliance.  The alliance, which works with organizations in both countries to increase social investment and improve Americans’ understanding of the border, offers tours for Americans who prefer to visit with a guide. One of the tours introduces them to nonprofits including a migrant shelter. Another takes them to a craft brewery and to Calle Hermosillo, a long street that is home to many new restaurants and bars. “Sonora, in addition to having the best beef in all of Mexico,” Mr. La Pierre said, “also has some of the best seafood in Mexico, because they’re adjacent to the Gulf of California, which Jacques Cousteau called ‘the aquarium of the world.’ What I tell our guests is that Sonora really has the best of surf and turf.” On a warm Saturday in early January, as I walked the downtown zone, averting my eyes to avoid the many vendors who will immediately try to pull you into their curio shops, I felt the energy change immediately. Mexican border cities are always a little busier and more alive than their American counterparts. Cars backed out of parking spots from every direction, and people moved briskly along the sidewalks. Amid endless pharmacies and dental offices catering to mostly-gone Americans, local life pulsed and thrived. As I turned a corner and made my way toward Calle Internacional, the street that once singularly marked the border, to view the wall art, I glimpsed a young woman on the American side of the fence who was reaching through it as she lovingly stroked the head of a teenage boy squatting on the other side. And I remembered Jessy Zamorano’s comment about tourists reacting when they witness these displays of humanity. It seems something fantastic happens when you draw a line on the ground: People almost instinctively reach out across it toward each other. And that’s a hard thing to appreciate from anywhere else but the border.",15144

By Shaun Pett The trick of Gastón Acurio’s latest restaurant, El Bodegón, is to make you believe it has always existed on this quiet corner in the Miraflores neighborhood. Mr. Acurio, Peru’s most famous chef, with a global empire of 50 restaurants, kept the name and much of the design of the previous restaurant in order to evoke a classic Limeña taberna. The walls are covered in old portraits of famous footballers and Peruvian celebrities. Classic rock — Sting, Clapton, the Beatles — plays in the background. Mostly local workers fill the intimate space, textured with dark wood, brick and marble tables, during a late lunch. With nearly 50 dishes, the ever-evolving menu at Bodegon (which, in fact, opened in July) is a deep dive into casera home-cooking and Lima’s multicultural cuisine. Over 20 years ago, Mr. Acurio lit the fuse for the boom in Peruvian cuisine, and here he is again, offering a new statement of possibilities. The chef said he is remembering and recovering the food from his childhood, “all the dishes that I lost in time because they were only made by my grandmother or my family or because they were just made in the ’70s.” While this effort could easily descend into an exercise in twee nostalgia, Mr. Acurio’s playfulness and sincerity grounds things in the present: The menu follows seasonal, local ingredients and he solicits food memories from his customers and on social media.  During a recent visit, baffled by options, we depended on the friendly and knowledgeable waiters to decipher the menu. We started with the salty and rich crab causa, poetically named “more crab than causa,” which arrived as a Pop Art provocation of golden mashed potato layers overflowing with a crab and egg salad, drenched in a Pepto-Bismol-pink sauce. A salad of lima beans was fresh and tasty. A whole cauliflower did something new with a vegetable oft overlooked in Peru, subbing here for chicken in the popular dish aji de gallina; cooked in a rich creamy sauce spiked with Parmesan and peppers, the cauliflower melted in my mouth. The huatia de res — an ancient pre-Columbian preparation of braised beef in herbs — was succulent, accentuated by sides of beans, rice and fried yuca.  For dessert, we ordered the suspiro (breath) de chiramoya, chunks of the buttery custard apple bathed in dulce de leche and topped with soft meringue. This is fun, casual gluttony and the copious portions have many diners leaving with leftovers. My only quibble — a minor lapse encountered at other Lima restaurants — was a glass of local draft beer delivered with far too much foam. But one can’t go wrong with classic pisco-based cocktails and the ginger ale-spiked Chilcano goes down far too easily. The experiments of Lima’s high-end tasting menus have garnered the spotlight, but El Bodegón is part of a growing movement to renovate the food of the everyday. Mr. Acurio is broadening the accessibility of Peru’s culinary gains and offering a quality of cooking rarely found at this price point in Lima. The hourlong lines at lunch — reservations are accepted for dinner only — already have him planning another taberna. El Bodegón, Calle Tarapacá 197, Miraflores; www.elbodegon.com.pe.

But few, if any, have spun that experience into culinary gold like Mason Hereford, whose restaurant Turkey and the Wolf in New Orleans was lauded by Bon Appétit as America’s best new restaurant in 2017. “I sure enough ate my share,” said Mr. Hereford, 31, who grew up Charlottesville, Va., before moving to New Orleans in 2008 and working his way from line cook to chef de cuisine at Coquette, a respected contemporary Southern bistro. “But it wasn’t until I came to this city of po’ boys that I began to consider the creative potential of a sandwich.” Sandwiches are the stars at this 40-seat, no-reservation restaurant with street-front patio seating for 25 more, a former barbecue joint and a wings shop in the Irish Channel neighborhood. Inside, cinder block walls are painted sea-foam green and décor runs to thrift store whimsy. Patrons order at the counter and eat at sundry chrome dinettes off mismatched dishes (including plastic Disney plates), seasoning their food with kitschy vintage salt and pepper shakers. But to call Turkey and the Wolf a sandwich shop is misleading. Standard lunchbox fare is just a launching pad for the high-flying imaginings of Mr. Hereford and his team, a merry band of inventors whose professional cooking chops are on view in the crowded but supremely orderly open kitchen. Over the course of two different lunches, friends and I grazed through much of the small, changing menu, which includes cocktails with enigmatic names like the bourbon-based They Grow Up Slow Fast and My Mom Blacks Out Better Than Yours, featuring pecan vodka and mulled wine.  Given the reports of lines out the door, our wait to order and sit was surprisingly short — probably thanks to a pipe-bursting freeze that had settled on the city. The collard green melt on rye wowed us with its marriage of tender, braised greens, crunchy slaw, gooey Swiss cheese and spicy pickled cherry pepper dressing. Lemony yogurt and cucumbers brightened a roti filled with deeply seasoned, slow-cooked lamb neck meat, while a crazy-looking sandwich of nicely chewy, fried bologna soared on the crisp vinegar-brined potato chips, melted American cheese and hot mustard also layered between its two thick slices of buttered-and-griddled white bread (baked by a friend of the chef).  On the “Not Sandwiches” side of the menu, which included deviled eggs garnished with fried chicken skin and an Alp-sized wedge salad, the fried potpie, plump with herb-infused, moist chicken and paired with a tarragon-buttermilk sauce, disappeared quickly.  According to Mr. Hereford, coming up with new dishes is a collaboration, and nothing appears on the menu until it’s been tinkered with and tasted up to 20 times by the kitchen staff. “We’re looking to create a fun vibe here, to be a place that doesn’t take itself too seriously,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean we don’t take our food seriously.” Turkey and the Wolf, 739 Jackson Avenue; 504-218-7428; turkeyandthewolf.com.

The rooms have high ceilings. And the terrace has sprawling views of the city. By Michael Kaminer Rooms start at about 165 Canadian dollars (about $131 at 80 cents to the U.S. dollar). For her first hotel project, the Montreal property developer Marie-Jeanne Rivard wanted to mix the coziness of homestays, the services of a hotel and the downtown feel of loft living. The result, open since last winter, is something new for Montreal: Twenty high-ceilinged, clean-lined rooms equipped like small apartments, complete with top-end appliances, tableware and cutlery. Abstract photomontages of Montreal street life adorn the whitewashed walls. A sleek aesthetic extends through Boxotel’s airy, poured-concrete lobby and to 175B, a subterranean gallery showcasing Quebec and Canadian artists. On Boxotel’s sixth floor, a tiny gym and sauna open to a sprawling outdoor terrace with panoramic downtown views. A reality-TV star in Quebec — she renovates and sells homes on the hit show “Flip a Fille” — Ms. Rivard often checks guests in herself at Boxotel’s tiny front desk, called “The Box Office.” With shabby residential buildings nearby, Boxotel’s block can feel bleak. But its Ontario Street location, a five-minute stroll from buzzy Blvd. St-Laurent to the east and the Quartiers des Spectacles zone of cultural attractions just south, makes Boxotel an ideal home base. All blond wood and white walls, my 390-square-foot Loft King Luxe room, the second-largest category, felt like a chic Montreal pied-à-terre. Meticulously fitted cabinetry hid sleek washer/dryer, dishwasher and refrigerator units from upscale German brand Blomberg; nooks held helpful basics like detergent and dishwashing liquid. The Montreal potter Benoit Daigle supplied the moss-green tableware. Scandinavian-inspired furniture, including a desk and love seat, added pops of color. Working in the room was challenging; the desk lamp was weak, and just two outlets faced the desk. My king bed was firm, and crisp sheets made falling asleep easy. But nonstop street noise punctuated my slumber. A deep-soaking bathtub between the bed and the sliding terrace doors went unused. Clamor aside, it was easy to imagine living in my “box” — as rooms are cheekily called — for an extended stay. The gray-paneled bathroom made me glad to be traveling solo; just a clear pane of glass separates the toilet from the shower. A simple button operates the enormous rain shower head, but kept popping off the wall. A backlit makeup mirror suspended above the compact sink adds a thoughtful touch. Ms. Rivard worked with the Montreal skin-care company Cocooning Love to create aroma-infused bath amenities like hô wood shower gel and lemon-cypress shampoo.  Montreal’s beards-and-tattoos set has already made Boxotel’s tiny Café Nomade a favored hangout. A counter with a compact kitchen, the cafe makes picture-perfect cold dishes like yogurt with fresh fruit, chia seeds and local honey ($6.95), and elegantly piled-up sandwiches like the Quebecois ($8) — creamy chicken salad, lettuce and pickles on sourdough. (The menu changes often.) Dense breads and pillowy croissants come from Montreal bakery Arhoma; Café Williams of Sherbrooke, Quebec, supplies beans for superb coffee drinks. From 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., guests can order room service; my Turkish breakfast ($8) and strong brewed coffee ($2) came in about 20 minutes, cheerfully delivered by Café Nomade’s barista and food preparer. A wooden block carried four nutty raisin-bread halves alongside tiny cups of almond butter, honey, and olives, mixed nuts and dates. It was filling and fortifying. Aside from the top-end appliances and kitchen accouterments, amenities are basic: High-speed internet, high-definition TV and a yoga mat rolled up in the entry closet of your “box.” Most rooms have terraces, which make perfect coffee-sipping spots in warm weather. Staffing here is lean, with just three or four T-shirted staffers typically on duty, but they’re courteous and responsive. Even in hotel-saturated Montreal, Boxotel feels fresh. The lack of traditional hotel-style pampering, and a very low staff-to-guest ratio, means the property is best suited to independent travelers. But it’s a terrific way to experience downtown Montreal like a local. Boxotel, 175 Rue Ontario Est, Montreal; boxotel.com. Advertisement",4399

By Shivani Vora The Caribbean island of St. Martin is on the road to recovery following the severe damage it sustained from last summer’s Hurricane Irma (Hurricane Maria had a minor impact on St. Martin).  As a result of the storm, the isle’s two airports, Princess Juliana International Airport and Grand Case International Airport, were temporarily closed to commercial flights; Princess Juliana’s main terminal also suffered structural damage. Many restaurants and stores on both the French and Dutch sides of St. Martin — the island is a dual nation — were forced to close as were most hotels. Frank Comito, the chief executive of the Caribbean Hotel & Tourism Association, an organization that represents businesses in 32 Caribbean destinations, said that St. Martin was one of the most hard-hit Caribbean destinations as a result of Irma. Today, the island is faring better than it was last fall but significant work will be required before it will be able to return to its pre-hurricane condition. Gordon Snow, the managing editor of The Daily Herald, an English-language newspaper on the island, said that many buildings, including several large hotels, saw significant damage because of Hurricane Irma and still need to be reconstructed. “This is my home, and I love it here, but there is a lot of rebuilding to do, and some of it hasn’t even begun yet,” he said. “But this island recovered from Hurricane Luis in 1995, and we will do so again.” The Dutch government is helping with the recovery by providing the island with 550 million euros (about $634 million) in aid. Mr. Snow said that the debris from the storm that littered the roads and beaches has been cleaned up. Kate Richardson, general manager of St. Martin’s tourism office, said that the beaches are as she remembers them as a child. “The beaches are back to their magnificent state, and the roads are litter free,” she said. Both airports are fully operational and run around 60 flights a week from 12 airlines. Princess Juliana, which reopened in October with the one runway it had before the storm, has daily nonstop service to and from the United States including a JetBlue flight to and from John F. Kennedy International Airport and an American Airlines flight to and from Miami International Airport. However, the terminal that sustained structural damage during Irma is still not open; passengers are temporarily being accommodated in tent-like structures.  The island’s other airport, Grand Case International Airport, reopened to commercial flights in September; the airport offers daily flights to and from Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Bart’s and to and from destinations in Europe, Canada and the United States. On St. Martin’s French side, more than 60 restaurants are open for business as are more than a dozen hotels including the Bleu Emeraude, a three-star beachfront property with 11 rooms. The general manager, Frederic Morel, said that the hotel reopened on Dec. 15, and while business was slow over the December holidays and in January, reservations have picked up for February. “More than half of our rooms are booked,” he said. Ms. Richardson said that 300 hotel rooms are currently available to book on the island’s French side; before Irma, that number was 1,700. At least 10 more hotels are scheduled to reopen before the end of the year. On the Dutch side of the island, around 80 percent of the restaurants are open, and 1,600 hotel rooms are available to book, Ms. Richardson said; before the hurricane, 4,115 rooms were available. St. Martin’s Dutch side is known for its more than dozen casinos, and while all closed following Irma, according to Mr. Snow, some have reopened including Jump Up Casino in the town of Philipsburg. Casinos in the hotels, however, have not reopened, including the one at Sonesta Maho Beach Resort, Casino & Spa; the property’s website says it is closed to guests until Aug. 31. But while many hotels throughout the island are still closed, the island’s attractions largely are not, Mr. Snow said. “The catamaran cruises are mostly running and so are the diving and snorkeling excursions,” he said. Rainforest Adventures, a popular eco-adventure attraction with a zip line in Emilio Wilson Park, is also open.  Cruises, too, are returning to St. Martin: the cruise port that can accommodate larger ships, St. Maarten’s Port Authority, reopened on Dec. 4; the 930-passenger Viking Sea from Viking cruises was the first ship to sail into the port. The island’s other cruise port, Port de Galisbay, is once again welcoming small vessels; Ms. Richardson said that the port is expecting 42 small cruises this year for a total of 4,500 passengers. In 2017, the port saw 1,624 passengers. Crystal Esprit, a 62-passenger yacht from the luxury cruise line Crystal Cruises, is running weekly itineraries to and from the port until mid-April, said Susan Robison, a company spokeswoman. St. Martin’s government announced a 10-year tourism plan last November, and Ms. Richardson said that the first few years of it are devoted, in part, to hurricane recovery. “We’re going to be focusing on regenerating the island,” she said.

5a7436d4d4211f00015beee3,2018-02-02T10:00:44+0000,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/travel/campeche-mexico-pyramids.html,Travel,"Of the nearly 1,000 registered archaeological sites scattered across the southeast Mexican state of Campeche, Xcalumkín is far from the most impressive. Just over 40 miles northeast of the state capital (also called Campeche), it looks, at first glance, like little more than a few half-excavated hillsides. On the stifling May morning that I visited, the scrubby forest was dry and radioactively bright, baked under a sky the color of a pilot flame. It didn’t take long for this abstraction of a city to come to life. Hills revealed themselves as pyramids. Fields became plazas. A cave opening suddenly in the ground — a tree, like an umbilical cord, growing from its center — became a reservoir. I had come out that morning with Rubí Peniche Lozano, who runs a restaurant called Capuchino in the historic center of Campeche, an extravagantly pretty town on the west of the Yucatán Peninsula. She’d brought along her sister, Ada, a local teacher, and Lirio Suarez Améndola, a former delegate for the National Institute of Anthropology and History, or I.N.A.H. Ms. Suarez walked us through the site, pointing out the hidden mouths of cisterns and offering I.N.A.H.’s best guesses as to what each structure might have been. Xcalumkín, she told us, had likely existed since the beginning of the millennium but, like most settlements in this part of the peninsula, would have flourished between the 8th and 10th centuries, part of a vast network of city-states and vassal towns that made up the classical Maya world. By 950 A.D., that world had all but disappeared. “To make the stucco they used to cover the buildings and pave the roads, they needed charcoal, so imagine how many trees they needed,” she said as we looked down into the reservoir that was now a cave. “They emptied their water sources, cut down all their trees. The temperature raised two degrees. They changed the climate completely.” She sounded almost exasperated. “Lots of people look at the Maya very romantically, that they lived with nature and all that, but it’s not true. They were just like us: human beings.” We had reached Xcalumkín by driving north along the modern highway that connects Campeche to Mérida in the neighboring state of Yucatán, following the route of the Camino Royal, or Royal Road, built for the visit of Mexico’s short-reigning Hapsburg Empress Carlota in the late 19th century. We stopped at Kankí and Acanmul, a pair of ruins that, despite lying just off the highway, receive almost no visitors. In the pretty colonial backwater of Hecelchakán, we ate breakfast at an enormous rotunda-like taco stand in the central plaza, famous enough not to require a name. For four generations and 40 years, the family that runs the place has turned out Campeche’s best cochinita pibil, a dish of adobo-rubbed pork roasted in an underground oven, and relleno negro, an ashy stew of ground turkey and pork stained black with charred chilies. Most days, they run out of cochinita by noon and relleno negro even earlier. The afternoon would take us to artisan towns like Dzitbalchén, known for its embroidered blouses, and Bécal, where Mexico’s finest panama hats are woven from hair-thin lengths of palm in damp underground caves. The whole day, we didn’t pass a single other traveler. Despite its pastel-hued jewel-box of a capital, its rich archaeological history, a clutch of top-notch hotels and food to compete with anything on the peninsula, Campeche remains mercifully lost to tourism. Campeche’s star attraction should be the ancient Maya city of Calakmul, once the most powerful city-state in the classical Maya world, now an immense archaeological site buried deep in the wild southern jungles of the 2,800-square-mile Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. But while Chichen Itza and Tulum, in the neighboring states of Yucatán and Quintana Roo, attract as many as 5,500 visitors per day, Calakmul draws barely 100. When I came down to Campeche for the first time in February 2017 (a relatively cool, dry month in Mexico’s tropical south) Calakmul is what I came to see. From the early 10th century until the late 1920s, when, according to the oral tradition of the local rubber tappers, an American prospector spotted the site from a low-flying plane, Calakmul was lost to time and memory (its presence was officially registered by I.N.A.H. in 1931). For the next 50 years, the rubber tappers working in the forest chipped the narrative glyphs from the city’s monolithic steles, selling the city’s recorded history one piece at a time. Excavations didn’t begin in earnest until the 1980s. To reach Calakmul, I drove four hours down well-paved roads, booby-trapped with ill-marked speed bumps, stopping en route at El Cachimbazo, a seaside restaurant in the town of Champotón, for a lunch of ceviche and Campeche’s unofficial state dish, pan de cazón (layers of tortilla and shredded shark bathed in tomato purée, jauntily capped with a whole habanero). At the entrance to the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, I dropped my things at a serene eco-lodge called Puerta Calakmul, by far the best hotel in the area (high-season rates start at $175), and crossed the road to see the exquisitely preserved stucco frieze at Balamku, one of many smaller archaeological sites in the area. At sundown, I drove five minutes down the road to watch millions of bats spill from the mouth of a hidden cave and spiral skyward. At dawn the next day, I woke to the call of howler monkeys and drove the last 90 minutes through the park to the site itself. On the way, I picked up my guide, Manuel Pech, who has lived most of his life in the nearby village of Conhuas. He had returned a year before from the capital, where he’d studied biology, “because,” he told me, “I wanted to save the world.” Growing up next to ruins, he seemed to view civilizational collapse as imminent rather than hypothetical. Mr. Pech and I spent well over three hours at Calakmul that morning, wandering among the lost foundations of untold buildings. At the ceremonial center, we climbed a flight of steep stone stairs to the summit of the highest pyramid. Fifteen hundred years ago, kings and priests would have performed their ceremonies here — coronations, perhaps, or sacrifices, though no one knows for sure — looking out over a city of 50,000 people with stucco-paved roads, called sakbe, radiating out from its center. My view was different. Jungle extended infinitely in every direction. To the south, Guatemala. To the north, the horizon undulated like heat. “Those hills out there,” Mr. Pech said, “we don’t know which are just hills and which are pyramids that we haven’t uncovered yet.” The only signs of human life were the peaks of Calakmul’s two other great pyramids bursting through the canopy like mountains through clouds. I left Calakmul the following day and drove east, stopping at Becán, where a series of interconnected plazas and public buildings suggest the shape of quotidian Maya life, and at Chicanná, once Becán’s aristocratic suburb, now another abandoned stone settlement in the forest, where heavily ornamented mansions reveal a world as stratified as our own. At Xpujil — the last of the ruins along the highway, roughly 40 minutes from Puerta Calakmul by car — I turned north along a recently paved two-lane road and through 40 miles of forest, virtually uninterrupted by human settlement. The trees along the roadside were more chartreuse than green. Swarms of butterflies ferried between them like they had places to go. The scenic route took me through languid towns like Dzitbalché and Iturbide, and to beautiful, lonely ruins at Dzibilnocac and Hochob, elaborately carved in an architectural style known today as “Chenes,” which Mr. Suarez would later describe as “Maya Baroque.” About 25 miles before Campeche, I stopped at Edzná, whose carefully reconstructed galleries, pyramids and open plazas rival Calakmul’s in grandeur. A short distance from Hacienda Huayamon — Campeche’s most luxurious hotel, housed in the restored remains of an 18th-century plantation — Edzná is Campeche’s most popular archaeological site. Even still, on the day I visited, there were more iguanas than people. When I reached Campeche that evening, I settled in at the Hacienda Huayamon’s sister hotel, Hacienda Puerta Campeche, just inside the city walls (rates in high season start at $418). Like most haciendas in the Yucatán, Huayamon — a 20-minute drive from the city — was founded in the 18th century (although most of its buildings date to the 19th century) to cultivate and process henequen, a tough fiber made from a variety of agave. Starting in 1870, the buildings that now house Puerta Campeche served as Huayamon’s warehouse and a shop selling everything from imported wines to lentils to rubber from the southern forests. Both are relics of the city’s 19th-century decline, a reminder of where the word decadence comes from. By the time henequen had become the Yucatán’s economic mainstay, most trade had shifted away from Campeche to the newly built port of Progreso — or Progress — on the peninsula’s northern coast. For the previous three centuries, Campeche, Mexico’s second-oldest port, had thrived at the periphery of law. Though just two hours from Mexico City by plane, Campeche was, in those days, far from the centers of colonial power and virtually ungovernable. When I met Ms. Peniche’s husband, the local historian Alejandro MacGregor Gonzalez, he told me, “contraband was this city’s glory!” He had asked me to join him for breakfast at a no-frills storefront on the Parque Santa Ana, a charming plaza just outside the city walls. He ordered us ice-cold bottles of sweet black tea and two trancas de lechón, the Taquería del Parque’s specialty. The tea, he explained, combined Campeche’s first colonial cash crop, sugar cane, with black tea that came in on British pirate ships in the 16th century. The trancas were sandwiches of lechón, a Creole roast pork dish from the Caribbean, served on crusty lengths of bread introduced by French corsairs. “That food is very Yucateco,” he said, pointing across the street to Taquería Hecelchakán, which trucks in cochinita from the town of the same name each morning. “This is very Campechano. Our whole culture is mixed!” Elsewhere in Mexico, the word campechano is usually used in the context of food and means just that — mixed — as in a campechano taco, made with meat and sausage, or a campechano ceviche, made with shrimp and octopus and whatever else is on hand. For the rest of the day, Mr. MacGregor showed me around the elegantly restored old quarter center of his hometown and its northern and southern edges, where the peaceful streets give way to mangroves and scruffy urban beaches. He told me about centuries of pirate attacks and the city walls — the last of their kind in Mexico — built to fend them off. He told me how his own ancestors, Scottish privateers, had arrived here in the 17th century via Charleston. We drank beers on the tranquil malecón and watched cormorants dive low over the water. The name Campeche, he explained, derives from the words kaam, meaning mirror, and pech, meaning birds in the near-extinct local dialect of Maya. “Campeche is literally ‘a mirror for the birds!” he said. I’ve never known someone to speak with so many exclamation points. That evening, I walked along quiet cobbled streets past candy-colored houses where old men and women sat out on the sidewalks to play cards and gossip. For dinner, I ate tamales and drank coconut horchata, slushy and sweet as a milkshake, at the open-air Portales de San Martín just outside the old city walls (there are several small restaurants, or antojerías, located in the Portales, all serving more or less the same food). I tried to imagine the city’s bloody, lawless past, but the image wouldn’t materialize. If Campeche today is one of the safest places in Mexico, it’s in part because, Mr. MacGregor told me, “we had 200 years of piracy, fear and violence. We’re not interested in all that now.” Pirates and traders, an empirical fact of a knowable past, seemed more remote and fantastic than a Maya world conjured from stone and dust. I had come back to Campeche, despite warnings about the May heat, to see an archaeological site that Mr. Pech had told me about, not far from Calakmul. His grandfather, he told me, had uncovered it back in 1950 during his youth as a rubber tapper (nearly all the ruins around Calakmul were found this way, though there are no records to confirm these stories). The first archaeologist officially entered the site in 1993, guided by Mr. Pech’s grandfather, and although I.N.A.H. spent a year restoring it in 2001, they soon abandoned it to the forest. They called the place Nadzcaan — Maya for Closer to the Sky. Nadzcaan isn’t technically open to the public, but the only real restriction on getting there is stamina. Set about nine miles back from the road, it’s accessible either on foot, a three-hour hike through the forest, or by motorbike (40 minutes plus a half-hour trudge on a gradual incline). Walking in, we passed iridescent wild turkeys and the fresh tracks of feral pigs. A troop of spider monkeys high up in the trees shook branches to scare us off. Eventually, Nadzcaan emerged coyly from the forest, the 130-foot pyramid at its center dissolving into the trees like the memory of a dream. That night we camped on top of the pyramid. I asked Mr. Pech what the Maya would have used this place for. He dragged a finger across his throat. “Sacrifice probably,” he said, “but we never really know.” The best we can do is guess what this world once looked like and how it all came crashing down. As the sun set, I looked out over the forest. Howler monkeys called from the distance. Cicadas chirred. A blood moon rose slowly into a bank of clouds and emerged, a half-hour later, washed clean. Mr. Pech smiled. “It’s like a mirror,” he said.",13910

By Stephanie Rosenbloom Vacation lodging used to mean a room with four walls in a hotel or motel. Today travelers are increasingly seeking — and easily finding — accommodations that allow them to be more in tune with their surroundings, be it a forest, a beach or a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  Airbnb’s booking data for the beginning of this year suggests that more travelers are ​interested in ​spending their vacations in what the short-term rental site calls “nontraditional​” spaces, particularly those that allow travelers to be or feel closer to nature. ​Bookings for nature lodges ​and ryokans (​traditional ​Japanese inns) ​have skyrocketed since last year. Reservations for yurts and recreational vehicles (R.V.s) have also spiked.  These are hardly new​ or nontraditional​ forms of shelter. The ryokan is​​ centuries old. Yurts have been ​used by nomads for ​decades​. Yet it seems interest in such lodgings has prompted more ​places ​to not ​only ​offer them, but ​​reimagine them, too. The ​latest iterations ​have modern comforts and deluxe trappings even as they aim to retain some of the minimalism and spirit of their predecessors. This year, Lakedale Resort at Three Lakes, an 82-acre property with cabins and cottages on San Juan Island in Washington state, is opening Lakedale Yurt Village, a wooded area by Fish Hook Lake with seven “luxury yurts” (rates start at $325 a night), each with a pillow-top king bed and en suite bathroom, a flat-panel television, refrigerator, sleeper sofa and private deck with a hot tub, barbecue, dining set and Adirondack chairs.  Interest in yurts and R.V.s, be they rustic or ritzy, isn’t surprising given the resurgence of camping, which Kampgrounds of America, one of the largest privately owned networks of campgrounds, has said is being driven by millennials. Today, companies like Tentrr allow would-be campers to book acres of private land and a fully equipped campsite with a few taps of an app or clicks on its website. And sites like Hipcamp make it easy to book lodgings like tree houses, yurts and R.V.s.  Even more so than in the case of R.V.s, new interpretations of the ryokan are at once a departure and a homage to the original.  Consider the Nobu Ryokan on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, Calif. Perched on the sand along the ocean, the low-slung hotel has 16 teak and ipe wood rooms (including teak soaking tubs) with tatami mats and sliding doors that bring the outdoors in. Rates are from $2,000 a night during peak periods. (The property is currently accepting reservations for stays beginning after Feb. 9.)  In Tokyo there’s the nascent Hoshinoya Tokyo resort, which at first blush looks like a high-rise. Yet behind the patterned metal lattice that veils the 17-story tower is a contemporary ryokan or rather, several: Each floor in the tower is designed to be like a six-room ryokan with a tatami hall and common lounges (ochanoma) where guests can find books, sake, teas and treats. In the rooms, there are kimonos and shoji screens. The property also has an indoor hot spring bath (rates from about $480 a night).  Other brands are taking a similar approach, blending old and new, East and West, resisting characterization as a single style. The Hiramatsu Hotels & Resorts, which has opened what it calls European-style ryokans — like the 13-room Atami on Sagami Bay in Shizuoka, Japan, which takes its inspiration from both ryokans and French auberges.  The Vipp hotel in Europe bills itself as an “untraditional hotel” as it’s really more a collection of properties in different locations. Vipp shelter, for instance, is a sleek steel-and-glass box inspired by industrial design (think submarines and airplanes) at Lake Immeln in Sweden (600 euros a night for up to two adults, or about $745), while Vipp loft has two queen beds with a kitchen, dining and living area at the top of a 1910 printing factory in the Islands Brygge area of Copenhagen (1,000 euros a night for up to four adults). This year, Vipp is opening Chimney house in a landmark brick building, a former water-pumping station, also in Copenhagen. All of the spaces are self check-in and there is no daily housekeeping, and no amenities such as a gym or restaurant. Additionally, new apps and websites are making it easy to discover properties that go beyond the everyday. Take, for instance, PlansMatter, a free site that last year began offering vacation rentals and hotel rooms selected primarily for their architectural merit, with properties ranging from under $100 to more than $1,000 a night. Users can search by rentals or hotels, and also by architect — including Frank Lloyd Wright, whose artful marriage of home and landscape is as in vogue as ever. The site is simply a place to browse properties; to book you click a link that takes you to the website of the property owner or manager, or his or her rental site page.  For example, PlansMatter has photos of and information about Wright’s 1950s Kinney House in Lancaster, Wis., a three-bedroom, more than 1,700-square-foot house that can be rented for $395 a night (two-night minimum stay required).

Here are a few techniques to make sure your room service meals are worth your money and appetite. By Shivani Vora Room service is often the last refuge of business travelers, and an overpriced, under-seasoned option for travelers without many options. According to Martyn Nail, the executive chef of Claridge’s hotel in London and author of the recently released “Claridge’s: The Cookbook,” “the food you get isn’t necessarily a reflection of who prepared it,” he said. “There’s an art to ordering room service.” He has a few tried and tested ways to make sure every room service meal is a good one.  If Mr. Nail isn’t in a rush, he requests that his meal is delivered in courses because the food tastes fresher and the dining experience feels more special and leisurely. Surprisingly, most hotel kitchens have no problem fulfilling this request. “I don’t like the idea of my entree getting cold while I have my starter, and if I’m having ice cream for dessert, it’s going to be melted by the time I get to it,” he said.   Consider how well a dish will travel before you order it. Many hotel kitchens are in the basement while your room might be on a high floor, which means that your meal could take up to 10 minutes to reach you after it leaves the kitchen, and that’s not including any other room service deliveries along the way.  While hot items are usually delivered in a hot box, they can still arrive lukewarm. Soups are the exception and tend to stay hot. Also, if you see a soufflé on the menu, don’t bother ordering it. Mr. Nail said that it will be a pancake by the time it reaches you. Club sandwiches and Caesar salads, on the other hand, travel especially well.  If there’s a regional dish or specialty on the menu, however, go for it. Mr. Nail said that these local specialties have been some of his best meals on the road.  Don’t be afraid to order off the menu, Mr. Nail said. “Hotel kitchens tend to have a wide variety of ingredients on hand, and if the chefs have time, they are happy to make you what you want,” he said. Just be reasonable and ask politely, and you’ll have great results. If you’re craving a specific dish, such as chicken potpie or meatloaf, ask for it but with a caveat: give advance notice, preferably 12 hours, if you want a labor-intensive dish or something particularly special.  Pick up the phone and speak to someone to place your order, even if you have the option to do it electronically through a tablet, app or your in-room television.  Mr. Nail said that your order taker is your guide through the menu and can share suggestions such as side dishes to pair with your entree that you may not have thought of. Some of those options may be upsells, but talking to a real person is the only way to hear the daily specials, or ask about options that may not be included in the menu.  The option isn’t available in your average, economy hotel with a chain restaurant attached, but if there’s a destination restaurant or one related to a well-known chef, you may be surprised.  Ask if the restaurant has a sommelier, first, and then if you can speak to them. Most luxury hotels have one, and they’re not there just to help in the restaurant or at the bar. “If you want a good glass of wine, a creative cocktail or another spirit to go along with your meal, ask for the sommelier to give you a call to discuss your options,” Mr. Nail said.

Don’t equate Orlando with mouse ears and thrill rides: The city is a checkerboard of intriguing neighborhoods filled with galleries, shops and restaurants.

 Ever since the early 1960s, when Walt Disney chose Central Florida as the location for his most extensive theme park, Walt Disney World, Orlando has been synonymous with mouse ears, thrill rides and daily parades. But most locals readily divulge that fantasy fulfillment has little to do with the real life of urban Orlando. From the downtown region heading north to well-to-do Winter Park, the city is a checkerboard of intriguing neighborhoods filled with historic bungalows, interesting galleries and cafes catering to the creative class. Nature is also a central attraction in the lake-filled city and suburbs that include warm springs preserves and parks with live oak stands. The glass-walled Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, opened in 2014, has given downtown a cultural bump, while homegrown creative endeavors include a new orchestra devoted to modern classics and unstarched performances. 
Explore the map and find things to do in Orlando.
 Make the Orlando Museum of Art (admission, $15) your first stop in erasing theme park stereotypes. It holds an engrossing collection of American art, including paintings by Thomas Moran, Georgia O’Keeffe and John Singer Sargent. But its contemporary galleries, featuring digital artworks by artists like Jennifer Steinkamp are, perhaps, most compelling. The museum annually awards the Florida Prize in Contemporary Art; last year’s finalists dealt with issues from social justice to violence in Syria. A new show, “State of Excellence: Treasures from Florida Private Collections,” runs through April 29, and focuses on European and American art. Set design does not begin and end with Disney, as the new Mathers Social Gathering lounge testifies. The downtown speakeasy-style bar resides on the third floor of a 19th-century furniture store. Patrons must find the hidden door in the foyer’s bookshelves to gain entry to the cavernous room with exposed brick walls and beams and conversation areas anchored by tufted leather couches and steamer-trunk coffee tables. Go at happy hour before the club-hoppers flood the place to indulge your design appreciation over a gin-and-cucumber Mathers Fizz ($15) and a bowl of roast fava beans ($8) served on silver platters. Tacos have hijacked the Orlando culinary scene with a string of newcomers from downtown’s Tin & Taco to the bustling Reyes Mezcaleria and the mural-covered Hunger Street Tacos in Winter Park. But if you can only hit one, make it Black Rooster Taqueria. The narrow, elbow-shaped space offers open views into the kitchen where chefs press corn tortillas to order while frying up pork fat, the centerpiece of the menu’s most indulgent taco ($3.50), and searing carne asada ($4). There are also fresh limeade specials, guacamole made to order ($6) and brothy bowls with slow-cooked meat, including pozole verde ($10.50). The limited service system — order at the counter and runners find you with the food — means you may not linger, but you’ll leave satisfied. Follow the creative crowd to whatever is happening at the Timucua Arts Foundation. Founded in 2000 by Benoit Glazer, the music director for the Cirque du Soleil show here called “La Nouba,” Timucua stages more than 70 events each year, most of them free, most of them concerts and many of them in Mr. Benoit’s living room, which is expansive enough to seat 99. It recently launched the new 15-piece Alterity Chamber Orchestra as its ensemble-in-residence. The orchestra presents contemporary classical pieces with passion, but without the formality normally associated with classical concerts. Picket-fenced bungalows, moss-laden trees and brick-paved streets fill the historic residential neighborhoods of Thornton Park and Lake Eola Heights to the east and north, respectively, of downtown Orlando’s Lake Eola. Take a D.I.Y. tour to get a feel for Old Florida life aboard one of the orange bikes in the Juice Bike Share program ($8 an hour). Make your first stop Downtown Credo coffee, a social-impact-oriented shop with four locations around town that sources coffee direct from growers and asks customers to name their price for each cup. Make sure to walk that bike around Lake Eola: Bikers are forbidden from cycling on the sidewalks that ring the shore. In the 19th century, old-money snowbirds from the north began spending their winters beside the lakes of Central Florida, particularly Winter Park, the Orlando neighbor that feels more like a village than a suburb. They and modern-day successors built mansions lining Lakes Osceola, Maitland and Virginia, which are connected by old logging channels: narrow passages about the width of the 18-seat pontoon boats operated by Scenic Boat Tour. The tour company’s hourlong itinerary ($14) takes in the fine homes and the Spanish-Mediterranean-style campus of Rollins College. The excursion is also a nature tour, especially in the slim canals where guides point out a 150-year-old live oak, among other sights. One of Winter Park’s affluent part-timers was Charles Hosmer Morse, whose heirs eventually amassed the largest collection of glass works by Louis Comfort Tiffany in the world and made it the anchor of the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art. In addition to wall-size, garden-themed panels, the museum’s Tiffany collection includes the kaleidoscopic chapel he created for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and several rooms from Laurelton Hall, his Long Island estate. For contemporary ballast, cross the leafy Rollins College campus to the Cornell Fine Arts Museum, which mounts shows with pieces that range from old master paintings to modern-day neon. If you’ve shopped in a hip stationary store recently, chances are you’ve seen the festive and funky designs of Rifle Paper Co. The Winter Park design firm operates an airy boutique in the Hannibal Square neighborhood, where you can pick up everything from cards and journals to wrapping paper and iPhone cases in its signature floral patterns. A few blocks east on Winter Park’s main drag, Park Avenue, independent boutiques include Violet Clover, selling blouses and accessories; and Han Design, with unique jewelry and Turkish rugs. Grab a novel and flop down in a cozy armchair at Writer’s Block Bookstore, where the staff tapes their mini book reviews to the shelves. Getting around much of Orlando requires a car, but Winter Park offers a bounty of restaurants within walking distance of each other. Start at the Ravenous Pig, staffed by crack bartenders who whip up cocktails that may include a rum-port-spiced apple Needle in the Hay ($12). Move on to bustling Prato, where the partner and chef Brandon McGlamery serves market-inspired Italian dishes, including house-made pastas ($17) and pizzas ($16) cooked in a wood-fired oven. He also oversees Luma on Park, a romantic spot with an open kitchen and a luscious pineapple curd ($8) on the dessert menu. The culinary arts and the fine arts meet at the Alfond Inn at Rollins, a few blocks from Park Avenue. Established by Rollins College, the nonprofit inn funnels all proceeds to its scholarship programs. Contemporary art fills the ground floor of the 112-room hotel in a rotating arrangement overseen by the curators of the Cornell Fine Arts Museum. Join the locals for post-dinner drinks in admiring the art or sitting around the courtyard fires beside the bougainvillea hedges.  The freshwater springs and abundant lakes of Central Florida are central to the appeal of the region. Rarely do you see such bodies of water buffered by native hardwood forests, which makes Wekiwa Springs State Park, about 16 miles from downtown, worth the trip. Giant spreading oaks festooned in Spanish moss shade the grass and palmetto fields where wild turkeys wander. Show up early to join the regulars in swimming circular laps in the designated swimming area of the Wekiva River. Rent a canoe ($19.15 for two hours) to paddle the waterway, deemed a National Wild and Scenic River, looking for wild things, including alligators, deer and black bear. Few places capture the creative energy of millennial Orlando as tastily as the four-year-old East End Market. Garden plots grow herbs and vegetables outside the building in the Audubon Park Garden District. Inside, a collection of businesses skew to culinary independents, including Skyebird Juice Bar & Experimental Kitchen, where fresh-pressed juices come in canning jars; Gideon’s Bakehouse, whose substantial cookies have a cult following; and Florida & Co., serving locally raised meats and seafood in sandwiches and small plates. Eat at the picnic tables beside the garden, then wander back through to shop the nifty potted succulents at Porch Therapy and the leather accessories made on the spot at Freehand Goods. In the pedestrian-friendly village of Winter Park, the Alfond Inn at Rollins offers resort amenities, including a rooftop pool, a restaurant that champions Florida products, and a rotating contemporary art collection from the local Cornell Fine Arts Museum. Rooms from $229; thealfondinn.com. The former utility commission headquarters has been converted into the 118-room Aloft Orlando Downtown, with the original terrazzo floors, marble walls and 10-foot floor-to-ceiling windows. It is conveniently located across the street from the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Rooms from $189; aloftorlandodowntown.com.

By Ingrid K. Williams For decades, drivers in Portland, Me., sped by Thompson’s Point, a forlorn peninsula jutting into the Fore River just west of I-295. Described as “the biggest dump in Portland” in the local independent monthly The Bollard in 2011, the area is today the city’s most unlikely hot spot. In 2015, a new outdoor concert venue began staging shows on the riverbank; this past summer’s slate of 14 performances included Wilco, the XX and Alabama Shakes. And nearby, an abandoned brick warehouse has been transformed into an entertainment row, with food-and-drink establishments alongside a peculiar cryptozoology museum and a circus school. One more reason to stop: a new ice skating rink open through March 4. In June 2016, this cult craft brewery relocated to an enormous facility with colorful murals splashed on the walls, steel tanks in the back and ample, two-level taproom seating. Expect lines out the door during releases of their hard-to-find, limited edition I.P.A.s, which attract fans from across the Northeast. 4 Thompson’s Point #108; bissellbrothers.com. Opened in August 2016 by the acclaimed local restaurateur Jason Loring, this fried chicken joint serves chicken and waffles with Maine maple syrup and cayenne-doused, Nashville-style fried chicken so spicy that orders come with protective rubber gloves. It also operates a convenient takeaway window in the Bissell Brothers taproom. 4 Thompson’s Point #107; bigjschicken.com. The study of hidden animals is the focus of this unusual museum, which moved to this location in July 2016. Exhibits explore the pseudoscience of mythological creatures, such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster and the Yeti. 4 Thompson’s Point #106; cryptozoologymuseum.com. From pinot gris to pinot noir, a variety of varietals are poured at this tasting room, which opened in May 2016.

He also recommends Merida and a Baja beach called Barriles. By Shivani Vora Guillermo del Toro, 52, who has best director and best screenplay Academy Award nominations for “The Shape of Water” (he won a Golden Globe Award for best director for the film), is well-known for his science-fiction and horror movies. (His other films include “Pacific Rim” and “Pan’s Labyrinth."")  But Mr. del Toro’s talents go beyond film: he has also co-authored a trilogy of vampire novels and is the creator of the computer-animated Netflix series “Trollhunters.” One of his latest projects, the drawings for the box of a limited-edition tequila from Patrón called Patrón x Guillermo del Toro, is a homage to his upbringing in Guadalajara, in the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. There, he would often see the fields of agave teeming with jimadores — the farmers who harvest blue weber agave plants used to make tequila. “It was fascinating to watch them work because their craft of picking and trimming the plants is so intricate,” he said. It’s the jimadores who inspired Mr. del Toro’s drawings, he said. And while Mr. Del Toro currently lives in Toronto and Los Angeles, he returns to Guadalajara every six weeks to visit his family and still sees the jimadores working in the fields. Below are edited excerpts from a recent conversation with him. Jalisco is where tequila is produced, but what does the state offer for tourists? There’s plenty to see. First of all, whether you drink tequila or not, I do think it’s worth visiting some tequila houses in the town of Tequila and in the Highlands region. By going to a house, you can learn about how the agave is extracted to produce the drink. But going beyond tequila, I love Magdalena, a small town famous for its opal mining. You can visit the mines and see how the workers find the stones. Then there’s Puerto Vallarta, which has beautiful beaches, and my hometown of Guadalajara, where my favorite sights are the murals by Jose Clemente Orozco — he is one of the greatest Mexican mural artists ever, and his art is everywhere is the city. In the Hospico Cabañas, for example, there’s a work called “Man of Fire” painted on a dome. What are some other destinations in Mexico that tourists tend to miss? Several places come to mind. Mérida, in the state of Yucatán, is a beautiful colonial city where the people used to dress in all white from head to toe. The culture is very rich, especially the music — it’s a limerick style called son where the phrases repeat again and again. Then you have Oaxaca, which is an incredibly mystical city with a lot of shamans. The cuisine is refined but spicy, and you find a lot of mole. And Campeche City, in the state of Campeche, is a vibrant port city with fantastic seafood which is also very nice to walk around in. Each of these places are in the same country but are so different culturally and cuisine-wise that they might as well be different countries. Compared with the cities you just named, Cancún and Cabo San Lucas are much more popular with tourists. Do they give travelers an authentic sense of Mexico at all? I’ve only been to Cancún once and didn’t really like it so I can’t offer any perspective there, but as for Cabo, you need to get away from the touristy parts to appreciate its beauty. For me, the hidden gem there is a beach called Barriles, near the city of La Paz. All the locals go there, and the swimming is fantastic. The beach also has food stands where you get the best lobster and fish. Do you have any recommendations for souvenirs that travelers to Mexico should buy? I’m partial to candies called borrachitos. They’re sugary and soft and come in different flavors. I also suggest buying alebrijes — they are these bright fantasy creatures handmade by local artists, and you can find them at craft markets all over the country. They’re distinctly Mexican.

By Jane Perlez The outdoor workroom in a lush garden not far from the mighty Mekong River seems a world apart from Paris. A dozen Laotian women talk among themselves as the city traffic from the streets of Vientiane swirls by. Their wooden shuttles make a soft slithering sound as they hand weave large swathes of silk fabric in rich colors on handcrafted looms.  Well before the success of handmade crafts on the e-commerce site Etsy, the studio of Carol Cassidy, an American master weaver, has been a favorite stop for travelers in this corner of Southeast Asia. Ms. Cassidy has been working with Laotian weavers in the backyard of a grand old colonial mansion in central Vientiane for nearly three decades. Together they have kept alive age-old traditions of Laotian design in woven cloth and the natural colors of a palette extracted from plants in the forests: reds, pinks, yellows, greens.  Just steps from the garden, her showroom, Lao Textiles, on the mansion’s wood-paneled first floor — a cool retreat from the city’s blazing heat — is a haven for easy-to-pack gifts. Day and evening silk scarves, zippered all-purpose silk pouches and elegant cushion covers are arrayed on tables, all at fairly reasonable prices for handmade pieces.  Few know that they are buying the creative efforts of weavers who also make top-of-the-line drapes, sofa and cushion coverings for the retail palaces of luxury fashion houses in Paris, London and Milan. On the afternoon of my visit, a weaver was working thin strips of buttery soft beige leather into off-white silk thread stretched across the wooden frame of her loom. Flecks of gold silk gave contrast. Ms. Cassidy designed the fabric with its slightly rough texture especially for window shades for a store on the Champs-Élysées.  “We are the new luxury because our pieces are still entirely created by human beings with the uniqueness the human hand brings to the fabrics,” Ms. Cassidy said. As consumers worry about the ecological impact of what they buy, woven Laotian silk is a near perfect investment. “You can come here and see the preparation of the silk, the dyeing of silk, the winding and the designing. You can see it on any given day.”  Ms. Cassidy and her husband, Dawit Seyoum, arrived in Laos in 1989. He had a background in small business development; weaving had been her passion since her father took the family to Mexico for a visit in the 1960s. She studied at the University of Helsinki under Dora Jung, the fabric designer for the Finnish architect, Alvar Aalto.  The collaboration between the famed architect and the fabric designer inspired the young Ms. Cassidy who would later transfer her skills to the temples of luxury-brand retail. “I learned from her that you could design fabric for a specific place,” she said. “You designed a fabric to consider the shape and the lines and the architectural features.”  In Laos, the couple could see the potential for showcasing to the world the extraordinary weaving that was used for religious and ritual ceremonies as well as everyday wear. Woven silk cloth in dazzling or muted colors are an intrinsic part of rural life in Laos, and of upper-class life, too. The fabrics are fashioned into the borders of long skirts still worn by Laotian women, into curtains and bed covers for village and grander homes, and into head cloths, sashes and intricate bodices for dress up occasions.  But the official atmosphere was unwelcoming: The Laos government was hard-line Communist. “It was an exact replica of East Germany,” Mr. Seyoum joked. He was an exile from Ethiopia, so he had some ideas about how to deal with authoritarian rule. To their surprise they won approval for the first business license issued to foreigners.  In those days, only the hardiest tourists mastered the hurdles for getting a visa. So their first sales were to expatriates at the embassies in the sleepy capital. Getting things done for overseas orders wasn’t easy. The government considered fax machines subversive; they took a boat trip to Thailand to communicate with the outside world.  The two-story house that had been the residence of the French governor general in Laos, Paul Blanchard de la Brosse, seemed an ideal place to establish the workshop. They flew to Versailles to talk to the owners-in-exile, and the government granted a lease. They began with three Laotian weavers. Now they employ more than 40.  At a mid-1990s show at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York they set up a demonstration of two looms operated by two weavers. It was a hit. Architects and interior designers raved about the surprise of the silks that would impress rich clients always on the look out for the new and exclusive. Peter Marino, the architect for high-end stores, including Chanel, Dior and Louis Vuitton, loved the olive-hued silk covering for a sofa, Mr. Seyoum recalled. Many assignments from Mr. Marino followed, using Laotian motifs and styles of weaving (brocades, ikat, tapestry) that are well-suited to the grandeur of luxe interiors.  The United States bombed Laos from 1965 to 1973, leaving the northern part of the country a wreck, a dangerous place with unexploded ordnance that has caused terrible injuries since. Many of the weavers, who mostly come from the Tai ethnic group, survived. Their looms, usually their most important possessions, were mobile and they were able to flee the bombing.  Producing the silk was one of the most difficult things to revive, Ms. Cassidy said. She invested in some of the worn-down silk farms in northern Laos, and soon had a ready supply. In the last few years, though, the silk supply has plummeted again, and the cost has increased because of the scarcity. Sometimes she resorts to silk from Thailand and Vietnam, but never uses Chinese silk, which is shiny and often synthetic.  In Laos, farmers still feed the silkworms with mulberry leaves, producing a fine silk. In Vietnam, the silk is coarser: It is fed with cassava. “Lao silk is matte, and uneven. As a textile artist I look for the variety and the hand-twisting of the silk.”  Many farmers are turning to more lucrative cash crops, including opium, for sale to China. The increasing scarcity of silk is forcing Ms. Cassidy to turn to more creative weaves — incorporating fine leather, feathers and cotton. It’s not such a bad thing, she said. The mixtures produce interesting textures.  The greatest challenge to the art is not only where to find a guaranteed supply of local silk, but how to encourage the next generation of Laotian weavers.  Bouakham Phengmixay, 39, with long black hair tied back in a ponytail and a radiant smile, is a star weaver at Lao Textiles. She has been working in the garden since 1997. “In my village in the north, the incentive to produce silk is dying because of the imports from Vietnam,” she said.  Her daughter, 16, knows how to weave, and made a hand-woven skirt when she was 9. But that was her first and last attempt at weaving. “She doesn’t want to weave anymore. Our daughters are really not interested in weaving. It’s not entertainment for them.” Young women want jobs in offices and banks, not at the loom.  But Ms. Cassidy is undeterred. She will find a way, she insists, to ensure the tradition of Laotian woven silk endures.  Lao Textiles, 82 Nokeo Khoumane, Ban Mixay, Vientiane; laotextiles.com.

By Shannon Sims SALVADOR, Brazil — This northeastern Brazilian city is famous for its Afro-Brazilian drumming traditions; the internationally acclaimed bloco-afro band Olodum has broadcast its colorful drums and pounding syncopation internationally for decades through music collaborations including Michael Jackson’s “They Don’t Really Care About Us” and Paul Simon’s “The Obvious Child”. To see that band — which is composed almost exclusively of men — or any of the city’s other renowned bloco-afros, like Ilê Aiyê, perform live in the streets of Salvador is a deep dive into the roots of this country’s musical traditions.  But traditions change. Or actually, traditions are changed. By women like the ones that make up Banda Didá, a group composed exclusively of black women, pounding out those same Afro-Brazilian rhythms, filling up Salvador’s night with its old sounds, played by new hands.  Banda Didá is a unique musical group breaking gender boundaries in the capital of Bahia, the state that is the epicenter of Brazil’s African cultural infusion. “Until Didá, no one here played like us,” said one of the band’s leaders and longest-serving members, Viviam Caroline de Jesus Queirós.  Formed in 1993, the band was believed to be the first all-female bloco-afro in Brazil. “We’ve brought visibility to a group — black women — that have been historically marginalized here,” Ms. Queirós said. “We’ve feminized percussion here.”  Though they’ve been around for years, Didá’s popularity today is representative of an atmosphere of female empowerment in Brazil. Didá, once a torchbearing group among dozens of all-male bloco-afros, now shares the streets of Salvador with a few other all-female groups. As Brazil’s power structure has turned more conservative in recent years, with many female politicians being replaced by male lawmakers who have pushed for legislation to limit women’s access to abortion, the country’s feminist movement has gained strength. For more Surfacing pieces, like one on a Jamaican synchronized swimming team, click here.   Banda Didá earned its visibility by taking on old social norms that pushed women away from drums. Historically, “drumming in Salvador has been considered a man’s role,” said Jeff Packman, a University of Toronto associate professor who specializes in the study of drum culture in Salvador. He and Ms. Queirós both report that the gender norms around drumming came out of particular beliefs about a woman’s role and place. One theory, the big bass drums are too heavy for women. The women could even get hurt, and then who would have the babies? Another theory suggested that playing drums in the streets in the night — especially during the bacchanalia of Carnival season, when drum groups perform most intensely — is too time-consuming and dangerous for women, who should instead stay home.  Good luck convincing the women of Banda Didá of those theories today. On a recent weekend evening, a few dozen of the group’s 85 members gathered in the second floor of their headquarters. Women, some with children in their laps, listened attentively to the guest speakers, which included older local black women sharing their experiences of finding strength in their feminism and their blackness. “It is our responsibility to share with the world the power that is within us as black women,” one speaker told the group.  Two nights later, the band was busy rehearsing its Carnival performance; the celebration is just weeks away. During the captivating rehearsals, which take place in the street in front of their headquarters, the women not only play bass drums — called surdos — strapped around their shoulders or waists and resting against knees protected by thick kneepads, but also swing the heavy, keg-sized drums up into the air, balancing them above their heads with one trembling arm, as the seconds tick by and the gathered crowd cheers, in an act symbolizing their defiance of those old gender rules. Adriana Portela, the first female conductor of a bloco-afro in Salvador’s history, attributes the debunking of the myths around female drumming to “the power of the uterus.” She said this just before rehearsal, while pulling on kneepads and helping the group’s young singer with new lyrics. Jean Jesus dos Santos, one of the younger members of the group — part of the next generation of Didá — was one room over and painting blush onto her cheeks.  “They used to say drumming wasn’t for women because the instrument was heavy,” said Jean. “But we’re warrior women, and yes, we can play. And the proof of that is there in the street: we play just as well as the men.”  An hour later, after their rehearsal and backstage at an Olodum show a block away, Olodum’s vice president, Marcelo Gentil, said he can’t disagree. “They are from Bahia, so they drank from the same source as Neguinho,” he said, referring to the man who is regarded as the founder of the samba-reggae rhythm that drives much of the drumming in Salvador. “And they play that rhythm a lot better than men who aren’t from Bahia.” Neguinho do Samba, a former leader of Olodum, founded Banda Didá in 1993. Neguinho died several years ago, but his daughter, Debora de Souza, remains an integral part of the administration of Banda Didá. While counting out registration forms in a yellow folder labeled “Carnaval,” Ms. de Souza recalled the passion that led her father to form Banda Didá. ""My dad was a feminist. He cared about women, and while he was with Olodum he saw that there was a need for there to be a female drum group.”  According to Ms. de Souza, Paul Simon felt so grateful to Olodum for helping him earn a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1992, that he helped him acquire the three-story colonial mansion where Banda Didá in now based. Neguinho’s vision was long-term: to form an all-female drum group, but also ensure the perpetuity of the group by offering free instrument-making workshops and music lessons for women and children at the house. Despite the financial uncertainty that troubles most Brazilian cultural groups that receive little government support, the Didá project has been a success. Today, 130 women and girls take drum lessons at Didá — still for free — creating a diverse pool of candidates for inclusion in the band. The group finances itself through private events and donations. Mornings at the Didá house are filled with the muted sounds of private tutoring in tambourine or conga drums behind closed doors. In the afternoon, young girls scamper down the central stairway after their drum lessons, and on a recent afternoon, older women waited in line to register to volunteer during the group’s Carnival performance.  The uniqueness of the city’s first all-female group, and the luxury of the group having a physical headquarters, means that Didá’s reputation now precedes it. The group used to go out to the poor neighborhoods around Salvador to recruit talented young drummers; now, on a typical day, a steady stream of young women show up at the house to inquire about drum lessons or joining the group.  ""This is the place where I found myself,” said Maiana Santos Bonfim, another young member of the band. “It's where I learned to accept myself, my hair, my body, my race. And I just love playing drums.” Ms. Queirós was just 16 years old when she started playing drums with Banda Didá. She is now 34 and pursuing a Ph.D. in samba-reggae ethnomusicology in her free time away from the group. “I feel like I became a woman through this group,” she said with steady conviction, between sips of passionfruit juice at a local Afro-Brazilian cafe. ""In my opinion, the drum could be the great technology for women this century. It redefines the body of a woman — especially black women,” said Ms. Queirós. “I think it’s a weapon; it’s a tool. It gives us power, and makes us more beautiful. And it makes it so that our message is heard farther and farther away.” Advertisement",8054

Its name is a salute to the Hamptons, another favorite place. He’s a fan of the Caribbean too. By Shivani Vora Jon Bon Jovi, 55, has been a rocker for more than three decades, but that doesn’t mean he is inclined to slow down. On March 14, his band Bon Jovi kicks off a two-month tour, This House Is Not for Sale, in the United States and Canada, and on April 14, the band will be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, in Cleveland. But first, in mid-February, Mr. Bon Jovi, along with his son, Jesse Bongiovi, 22, will release a rosé wine, Diving into Hampton Water (the name is a homage to their Hamptons home). The duo collaborated with the well-regarded French winemaker Gérard Bertrand on their venture; the wine is produced in France’s Languedoc-Roussillon region, in the country’s south, and retails for $25. Mr. Bon Jovi’s family has long had an affinity for rosé and drink it frequently when on vacation. “It’s a favorite in our household because you can drink it starting with lunch and into the evening, and we enjoy lots of it whenever we travel,” he said.  Over lunch at Wild, a gluten-free restaurant in Manhattan’s West Village where Mr. Bon Jovi regularly dines, he spoke about how he discovered a new part of France through the process of producing the wine and about his travels in general; Jesse was there, too. Below, edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Bon Jovi. You and Jesse visited Languedoc-Roussillon for your wine project. What was your impression of the region? I have been to the Côte d’Azur at least 30 times before but never to this region, which is also in the south of France. It’s a storybook area with castles and ruins and rolling hills, and I really loved the architecture — the medieval castles were in such good shape. Also, you’re not really going to find any chain restaurants there. We dined at all tiny, family-run places, and I ate a lot of seafood, especially shellfish. Americans haven’t discovered this part of France yet, and it was a pleasure to discover. Growing up in New Jersey, I’ve been preaching my whole life that you have to get out to find the beautiful places in this world. How much are you on the road for work? Rock ’n’ roll is cyclical. You do a record and you support it [by going on tour], and then it could be two years before you’re out on the road again. When you’re on tour, what kind of hotels do you like to stay at? I don’t need opulence. I need simplicity because I’m in a different hotel every day so the biggest suite is a waste because I can’t use it. But I do need a hotel with a gym and a humidifier for my room. I also don’t want any flowers in my room because they give me allergies. Do you have a favorite hotel? The Peninsula in Chicago is my favorite in the U.S. Everything about it is awesome — the gym, the bar, the restaurant and the beds in the rooms. What are some of your favorite spots in the Hamptons where you have a home? And how do you spend your time there?  I’m one of the owners of the Blue Parrot [a Mexican restaurant in East Hampton] so that’s a clubhouse for me. And there’s a market called Round Swamp Farm which has fresh vegetables, great flowers and amazing homemade meals. I also love to eat at Topping Rose. We live on Main Beach [in East Hampton], and we’re out in the ocean and on the sand every day. The Hamptons is an outdoor life — we go on beach walks, and I’m an avid runner. I also go bicycling. Besides the Hamptons, where else do you enjoy vacationing? The Caribbean. We’ve been going to St. Bart’s for years. I actually honeymooned there in 1989. We rented a house then. We’ve also gone to the British Virgin Islands, Mustique, the Caymans, St. Kitts and Turks and Caicos. In the summer, we go to Europe. We’ve done Turkey and Italy and Greece. We’ll usually go along the coast in a boat. Given the hurricanes that affected the Caribbean in 2017, will you still vacation there this year? Absolutely. I want to support the region and the economy as much as I can. I’d go to St. Bart’s immediately.  Advertisement",4146

By Lucas Peterson China is one of the world’s most exciting and rewarding places to visit, but can be intimidating even to experienced travelers, who might struggle with communication and lack of familiarity with rules and customs. Here’s a handful of practical tips to help make sure your trip to the world’s most populous country is smooth sailing from start to finish. The good news: Those annoying and expensive single-entry visas are a thing of the past. Americans can now apply for a 10-year, multiple-entry visa from the Chinese consulate. Download the form from the embassy website, type up the application and bring copies of your travel itinerary to your local consulate or embassy (depending on your location). Several days and a $140 fee later, you should be all set. There are also visa services that, for a fee, will take your application to the consulate for you.  One other important note: Passport and visa expiration dates rarely line up exactly, creating situations where a passport might expire while a visa is still valid. I found myself in this exact situation before my last trip — would I have to go through the whole costly and time-consuming application process again? No — you are allowed to travel on a valid visa that’s in an expired passport as long as personal details like name and date of birth match up exactly (bring both passports).  You’ll notice blue and green QR codes at nearly every business in China, from the glitziest boutique to the most humble dumpling shop. WeChat Pay and Alipay are gradually turning the Chinese economy cashless: Simply enter the amount you want to pay, scan the business’s QR code, and boom, you have paid directly from your bank account. It’s something of a revolution — one that you, as a tourist, will not be a part of. Cashless payment in China requires a Chinese bank card, which you can’t get unless you’re a citizen or resident. Don’t count on businesses accepting your foreign credit card, either — you’ll frequently find yourself out of luck. So load up on cash when you can — fortunately, I’ve never had trouble finding A.T.M.s in Chinese cities, and withdrawing from Chinese currency with my American debit card has been trouble-free. If you want to play it safe, you can exchange for some at your local bank before you go. While you probably won’t be participating in the cashless revolution, you will be able to use Didi Chuxing, the Chinese version of Uber (the company, in fact, purchased Uber’s operations in China in 2016, forcing them out). I found Didi to be inexpensive and as reliable as Uber is in the United States, with one caveat: paying by credit card. Didi wouldn’t accept my Chase card, but did accept one from my credit union. Then, unfortunately, my credit union repeatedly flagged the charges as suspicious, leading to several long phone conversations with the fraud department. While not foolproof, you can set a travel notification on the card you plan to use before you leave. You can also enroll in text notifications for fraudulent activity, which allow you to verify the veracity of charges right away. Speaking of phone conversations, I found the best way to cheaply make calls was through the WeChat app. A $9.99 credit (which comes with a $2.50 bonus), purchased within the app, lasts a long time. Calls to the United States are only a penny per minute, and the sound quality is decent. Texting on WeChat is easy, and I was also able to use iMessage without issue. WhatsApp is blocked in China. While you should always remain alert, China is remarkably safe for foreigners. In total, I’ve spent over a year in China, and have never felt in danger or threatened while walking around, no matter the hour.  Chinese traffic, however, can be horrendous, and navigating streets as a pedestrian is always an adventure. Buckle up when in a vehicle, and be extremely careful when crossing the street: Cars do not necessarily yield to pedestrians, and motorcycles and scooters do not seem to yield to anything — not even red lights. While you won’t be able to buy a SIM card for your phone that includes a Chinese phone number, data plans with 4G speed are available for foreigners. Check at the airport (I bought one in a convenience store), or at the hostel or hotel where you’re staying, and be ready to show your passport. Wi-Fi is everywhere in China, from the pricey malls of Shanghai to modest mom-and-pop restaurants in the smaller cities. The bad news is that you won’t be able to access it some of the time, as it frequently requires you to enter a local phone number to receive a Wi-Fi access code.  There are ways to circumvent this. Having a WeChat account will grant access to certain Wi-Fi networks. I also use a Google Voice number to receive internet access codes, which works part of the time. But wait — isn’t Google blocked in China? That brings us to … The Chinese government does a fairly thorough job censoring websites and traffic from sources it deems potentially unsavory or damaging to the ruling Communist Party. Say goodbye to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, any Google-related services (including Gmail), and even (gasp!) The New York Times. There are, however, a few holes in the Great Firewall, as it is called. Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, essentially function as tunnels under the aforementioned firewall, connecting to a private network in a country with more internet freedom, like the United States or Japan. (VPNs are a legal gray area in China. The unauthorized business or commercial use of VPNs in China is not legal, but tourists checking their email or Facebook are not likely to run into problems.) While it’s a fairly easy way for you — and almost every young Chinese person I interacted with — to connect with the outside world, VPNs do have limitations: They can slow traffic noticeably, and aren’t always reliable.  There are a number of well-reviewed VPNs with names like Golden Frog and NordVPN — I opted for one called ExpressVPN, which costs $12.95 per month and offers a discount if you purchase a yearly subscription. I’d put my overall connection success rate between 85 and 90 percent. I also tried a free service called TunnelBear with slightly less consistent results. TunnelBear is free up to 500 megabytes of data per month — after that, you’ll have to pay. To get an idea of how long that will last you, loading The Times home page and clicking on an article consumed 6 megabytes. One obvious, but essential, tip: Download and set up your VPN before you leave for China. Once you’re there, you’ll be blocked from downloading any VPNs.  If you’re like me, you’ve come to depend on Google Maps considerably during your travels. In China, you would be wise to rid yourself of that notion. Even with a VPN, Google Maps in China is filled with incomplete or sometimes just flat-out incorrect information. For example: There are no fewer than six subway lines currently operating in Chengdu. According to Google Maps, there are just two. I recommend downloading the app Tencent Maps for your trip. While it can be difficult to navigate for those who don’t read Chinese, it’s worth having for its accuracy. Moreover, it will sometimes recognize English words you input (“airport,” and names of some businesses, for example). It also does a great job plotting out directions. Just drop a pin (like you would in Google Maps) on a location in Tencent Maps, and it will give you accurate public transportation, driving, or walking directions.  WeChat dominates the country and is used to keep in touch with friends, pay for meals in restaurants, get news and play games — it even serves as something of a dating app. Download it if you’re going to spend any significant amount of time in China, as you will need it to keep in touch with locals you meet along the way. Just don’t use the messaging feature to say anything you wouldn’t want the Chinese government to read — your privacy protections are nil (WeChat disputes the extent to which it stores and shares information with Chinese authorities). I’ve found Pleco to be a useful translation app — you can drop in English words, or paste in Chinese characters to receive their counterparts. And Dianping, the Chinese version of Yelp, is helpful for finding restaurants. You’ll notice plenty of well-maintained public restrooms in China, but they’re not always stocked with toilet paper. You would be wise to carry a small stash with you. This applies to napkins in restaurants as well — at smaller, more casual places, diners are expected to have their own supply on hand.

                    JUST based on the new luxury jets that were the hottest items at the National Business Aviation Association annual convention in Atlanta this week, it would be easy to overlook that the private jet business has been mired in a depression for two years.         
                    But at the very highest niche, where customers can easily pay well over $40 million for a jet and more than $8 million to outfit the cabin, the business appears to be surviving the economic downturn. On the eve of the convention, for example, the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier stunned its high-end competitors by introducing with great fanfare two top-of-the-line, formerly hush-hush, large jets -- the Global 7000 and Global 8000 -- at an eye-popping price of about $65 million apiece.         
                    Brad Nolen, Bombardier's director of product strategy, said that the new ultralong-range planes, which will be able to fly nonstop on routes like Beijing to Washington and New York to Mumbai, are aimed at multinational corporations and high-net-worth individuals who want to travel great distances nonstop in airplanes whose cabins ''emulate the comfort of the home environment.''         
                    Bombardier's announcement was made at a lavish party at the DeKalb Peachtree executive airport in Atlanta, where private jet makers and sellers had flown in about 100 jets for display.         
                    Gulfstream also displayed the lavish interior of a previously announced new top-shelf model, the $60 million Gulfstream G650, whose most remarkable feature is that it can fly nearly at the speed of sound. Gulfstream already has about 100 firm orders for the jet.         
                    Meanwhile, at the DeKalb airport display, sales representatives from the Brazilian manufacturer Embraer were showing prospective customers through the interior of its new Lineage 1000 jet, which is as big as an airliner. Price: about $50 million.         
                    It's certainly true that the business aviation industry, which includes all types of private planes, from single-engine props to the mightiest intercontinental jets, has been reeling. That's especially so with jets. A Honeywell Aerospace forecast says that deliveries of new jets will be down about 17 percent this year, after plunging 34 percent in 2009 -- when 849 jets were delivered compared with 1,313 in 2008. The 2008 deliveries, a record, had capped a dizzying five-year span of surging industry growth.         
                    Over the last two years, companies in the Unites States shut down flight departments and sold corporate jets of all sizes -- partly because of the economy but also in part because of bad public (and shareholder) reaction against perceived excess. That the market has held its own or even grown for the most expensive jets is an indication of expanding international wealth and the ability of some wealthy customers to fly beneath the radar, so to speak, because they do not report to shareholders or a corporate board that is anxious about perceptions.         
                    Data on private jet shipments from the General Aircraft Manufacturers Association bears this out. While jet shipments are off sharply in general, the so-called heavy-metal niche, where luxury and long-haul range are cherished, is doing fine.         
                    Bombardier, for example, will deliver 51 of its $40 million Global Express jets this year, the same number as last year, and up from 46 in 2008. In 2009, Gulfstream delivered 88 of its G300 through G550 models, which cost $33 million to $50 million -- up from 79 in 2008. And Dassault is expected to deliver 32 of its $50 million Falcon 7X models this year, up from 21 last year.         
                    Meanwhile, worldwide demand is growing for even bigger planes, converted from commercial airliners. The two major commercial airliner makers, Boeing and Airbus, already sell private versions of their 737 and A320 commercial planes, respectively. And as airlines have retired a large number of 50-seat regional jets in recent years, some of those used planes are being scooped up and converted.         
                    ''There are definitely people who have the wealth to do this,'' said Sean Gillespie, director of sales and marketing at Flying Colours Corporation, which installs cabin interiors and equipment on new high-end business jets and converts new and used regional jets.         
                    Business has been so good, especially from China and India, that the company is undertaking a major expansion of its plant in Peterborough, Ontario, where Mr. Gillespie said he expected to accommodate more work on even bigger commercial aircraft. ''We've had requests from people who might now own a Global XRS or a Gulfstream G5, who get to where they want the next thing in an airplane,'' he said.         
                    Assuming you have enough money, it is a good time to buy a used commercial regional jet, like a Bombardier CRJ, for your personal or business flying. ''You can buy one at a very good price for the size of the airplane you'll get,'' Mr. Gillespie said. Flying Colours typically equips converted CRJs with fuel tanks that increase flying range up to about 3,000 miles, he said.         
                    ''We work with a range of floor plans and designs for things like exotic veneers and leathers,'' he added. ''And the top-end in-flight entertainment systems are the rage these days, including high-speed Internet systems, which are almost a standard option now.''         
                    Which could be useful for the wealthy customer who may eventually tire of being confined to a converted regional jet or 737. While flying across the Continental Divide, say, that customer might easily surf to lots of information about turning ever-larger airliners to private use, perhaps emulating John Travolta, who pilots his own converted Boeing 707, along with four other private jets in his personal fleet.         
                    For years, even bigger airliners like 767 and 747 jumbo jets have been in private use by wealthy individuals and some companies. And the biggest commercial airplane of them all, the Airbus double-decker A380, is also now in demand.         
                    Major companies that do airliner maintenance and conversions like Lufthansa Technik have shown detailed designs for so-called V.I.P. models of the A380. Some designs feature multiple bedrooms, lounges, a dining room and even a movie theater. The retail price of the A380, by the way, is about $320 million. Add about $100 million more for a top-quality converted cabin.         
                    ''Obviously you can go as big as you want, even as big as the A380, and there are high-net-worth individuals who are looking to do just that,'' Mr. Gillespie said.

                    AMERICAN investors can buy bonds issued by foreign governments that are designed to provide protection against inflation, but strategists say those bonds are really more of a bet against the dollar.         
                    ''If you are a U.S. dollar-based investor, the currency fluctuations will overwhelm anything you get from inflation indexing'' on the foreign bonds, said Aaron Gurwitz, the head of global investment strategy at Barclays Wealth.         
                    For more than a decade, the United States Treasury has been selling bonds protected from inflation, known as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, whose coupon payments are based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. Investors primarily concerned about protecting their purchasing power during retirement should own TIPS, Mr. Gurwitz said.         
                    Some strategists say that owning the foreign bonds -- individually in a well-rounded bond portfolio, or through an exchange-traded fund -- can be a good way to diversify and add exposure to other currencies.         
                    Brett Hammond, the chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF, pointed out that global inflation-protected securities, as these bonds are called, typically perform very differently from other asset classes like stocks and commodities -- and even other types of bonds.         
                    Owning any type of foreign bonds hedges an individual investor's portfolio against a decline in the dollar and is especially useful if the portfolio has little exposure to other currencies through investments like foreign stocks. This is true, he said, for investors of any age.         
                    David Darst, the chief investment strategist for the global wealth management group of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, recommends global inflation-protected securities precisely because they are both a hedge against a decline in the dollar and protection against global inflation.         
                    ''It is more of a currency play than an inflation play,'' he said. ''But to the degree that inflation picks up with a global economic recovery, then you will be getting two hedges.'' Morgan Stanley projects the dollar will fall to $1.60 against the euro by the end of 2010, down from about $1.50 now.         
                    Mr. Darst recommends that individual investors hold 3 percent to 4 percent of their total portfolio in inflation-protected bonds. This allocation could be entirely in TIPS or in a combination of TIPS and global inflation-protected securities, he said, depending on what the investor thought of the dollar.         
                    American investors can buy bonds from specific foreign countries through a broker, or investors can own a diverse basket of the bonds by purchasing the SPDR Deutsche Bank International Government Inflation-Protected Bond exchange-traded fund. This fund owns inflation-adjusted bonds from 17 countries, including France, Brazil and South Korea, but not the United States. The bonds are denominated in 14 currencies. At the moment, no comparable traditional mutual fund is available, according to Morningstar.         
                    Scott Burns, the director of exchange-traded fund analysis for Morningstar, recommends owning both the Deutsche Bank fund and the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund, which only owns American TIPS.         
                    He pointed out that a decline in the dollar often coincides with rising inflation. ''If the dollar goes down, the Consumer Price Index generally goes up,'' he said, because the cost of imported goods increases for American consumers.         
                    For investors who want exposure to foreign currencies but are not interested in inflation-protected bonds, Mr. Burns recommended two funds that own traditional foreign government bonds: the SPDR Barclays Capital International Treasury Bonds fund, which primarily owns bonds issued by developed countries, and the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond fund. Because inflation has been very low during the recession, many investors have not been focused on inflation-adjusted bonds, which makes it easy to gauge the broad market consensus for inflation: the difference between the interest rates offered for TIPS and for plain Treasury bonds indicates what investors think future inflation will be. At the moment, TIPS prices suggest an average annual inflation rate of 1.6 percent over the next five years and 2.11 percent over the next 10 years.         
                    If inflation is higher than that over 5 to 10 years, the current TIPS bondholders would get a higher return. If inflation fears return, though, those expectations will probably be priced into the TIPS market.         
                    Some investment strategists say that makes this a good time to buy inflation-protected bonds -- either TIPS or their foreign counterparts -- precisely because the outlook for inflation is relatively benign. ''You don't want to buy flood insurance when the river is already in your living room,'' Mr. Burns said.

 Vincent Gasquet is a pizza chef who owns a tiny shop in the French Alps. At night, he is one of about 80 volunteers who search mountain passes for migrants trying to hike from Italy to France. The migrants attempt to cross each night through sub-zero temperatures. Some wear only light jackets and sneakers, and one man recently lost his feet to frostbite. “If the Alps become a graveyard, I’ll be ashamed of myself for the rest of my life,” Mr. Gasquet said. The migrants often head for Montgenèvre, a ski town nestled against the border. France offers them more work and a chance at a better life. One night, Mr. Gasquet got a call from a group that had crossed into Montgenèvre. They got his number through word of mouth. To evade border police checkpoints, the migrants follow paths through the forest, often at night, when it is easy to get lost. “Ninety percent of them have never seen snow in their lives,” he said. “Some of them say, ‘We’ve seen it on TV,’ but on the TV, you don’t feel the cold.” He drove to find them. The work is risky. Helping anybody enter or travel in France without valid paperwork is technically illegal. When he reached Montgenèvre, four young men from eastern Africa were shivering behind a snow bank, while another stood in the street. He hurried them into his car and drove them to a shelter.It would have been a perilous walk after hours in the snow. On another night, Mr. Gasquet and other volunteers set out by car and on foot. They spotted a group walking through the snow and hurried them into the car and to a shelter called Le Refuge. Here, the new arrivals can get warm, have a hot meal and change into dry clothes. “It’s not my place to say whether or not I want migrants in my country. That’s a job for the politicians,” Mr. Gasquet said. “All I know is that I don’t want people dying in front of my door.” Advertisement",1925

 This is Ding Shanshan. Her friends, her family and her pet turtle all live in Beijing. It’s the only home she has ever known. But Shanshan, 7, and her family are no longer welcome in the Chinese capital. The government is kicking out tens of thousands of families with roots in rural China to “beautify” the Communist Party’s flagship city. Entire neighborhoods have been leveled in a wave of forced evictions. I met the Ding family just as they had settled on a plan: They were going to leave Beijing and return to the countryside. For Shanshan that would mean one of the longest trips of her life. The family set out during Lunar New Year, a time when hundreds of millions of people return to their rural hometowns. We boarded a train bound for Henan Province in central China. Shanshan ate sunflower seeds and played video games to pass the time.  When we arrived in Henan, Shanshan and her family paraded down the streets in a tractor. They spent more than $32 at a supermarket, buying pork, yogurt and strawberries. Henan was lively and unrestrained. Children skidded down the icy sidewalks on cardboard boxes. Men played rowdy games of poker on the street. Soon after the family arrived in Henan, the magnitude of the decision struck Shanshan. Already, she said, she missed her friends and grandparents back in Beijing. Her father, Ding Fei, knows the transition will be difficult. “We had no choice but to leave,” he said. With Lunar New Year approaching, the family reminisced with neighbors about local traditions, like slaughtering pigs, lighting fireworks and hanging decorations.  On their first night back, the family ate noodles — a favorite food. The following morning, Shanshan’s mother, Fang Juan, brushed her daughter’s hair, just as she did in Beijing. “Here, in our hometown, we have our own place,” Shanshan’s father said. “It can't be demolished.” Advertisement",1900

 After nearly seven years and hundreds of thousands of deaths, the war in Syria continues to defy attempts at a resolution, and it has reached a new level of intensity in recent weeks. Turkish forces launched an offensive against Kurdish troops in the north, Israel clashed with Iranian and Syrian forces on the country’s southwestern border and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria unleashed a brutal assault on the rebel enclave of East Ghouta. Here are the broad outlines of the current phase of the Syrian war, which is largely driven by three major intersecting conflicts playing out at the same time. Turkey Turkey versus the Kurds Kobani Manbij Hasaka Azaz Afrin Al Bab Kurdish control Aleppo Idlib Raqqa Assad versus rebels Ath Thawra Isis control Euphrates River Rebel control The battle against ISIS Deir al-Zour Syria Hama Mayadin Government Control Homs Palmyra Iraq Abu Kamal Sparsely populated areas lebanon East Ghouta Damascus Areas of control by IHS Conflict Monitor as of Feb. 5 Nawa Suwayda Jordan Dar‘a Turkey Turkey versus the Kurds Kobani Manbij Azaz Hasaka Afrin Al Bab Kurdish control Aleppo Raqqa Assad versus rebels Isis control Ath Thawra Euphrates River Rebel control The battle against ISIS Deir al-Zour Syria Hama Mayadin Government Control Homs Palmyra Iraq Abu Kamal lebanon Sparsely populated areas East Ghouta Damascus Areas of control by IHS Conflict Monitor as of Feb. 5 Nawa Suwayda Jordan Dar‘a Turkey Turkey versus the Kurds Kobani Manbij Azaz Hasaka Afrin Al Bab Kurdish control Aleppo Raqqa Assad versus rebels Isis control Ath Thawra Euphrates River Rebel control The battle against ISIS Deir al-Zour Syria Hama Mayadin Government Control Homs Palmyra Iraq Abu Kamal lebanon Sparsely populated areas East Ghouta Damascus Areas of control by IHS Conflict Monitor as of Feb. 5 Nawa Suwayda Jordan Dar‘a Turkey Kurdish control Aleppo Raqqa Isis control Rebel control Government Control Homs Palmyra Iraq Syria Sparsely populated areas Damascus Areas of control by IHS Conflict Monitor as of Feb. 5 Jordan Turkey Syria Iraq Jordan Government Control Rebel control Kurdish control ISIS control Areas of control by IHS Conflict Monitor as of Feb. 5 As international players scramble to influence the war, a mix of them – Iranian, Turkish, Russian, American, Israeli and others – are fighting in different parts of Syria. The complexity of the war’s alliances helps explain why it may continue for years.

Rebels had no unified leadership, and their foreign backers – including the United States – cut support, while the government’s backers increased their support. The rebels have been pushed into a few remaining bastions, and no one remains who is willing and able to topple Mr. Assad. Yet government forces are depleted, leaving Mr. Assad without sufficient troops to clear and hold the entire country. Many pro-government forces are militias that can kill rebels but not reimpose governance. Even in areas nominally under Mr. Assad’s control, foreign backers like Iran and Russia often exercise greater control than the Syrian government. And Mr. Assad’s scorched-earth campaigns have killed hundreds of thousands of people and obliterated cities, destroying the social fabric that could help the country unify. Most recently, he unleashed airstrikes and rockets against a rebel enclave outside Damascus, East Ghouta, killing nearly 100 people.

Kurdish-led forces, backed by the United States, pushed them out of their de facto capital, Raqqa, and, along with forces backed by Syria and Russia, have pinned them down to a narrowing band of territory on Syria’s eastern border. But Islamic State fighters have returned to their insurgent roots, hiding out in the desert and emerging to carry out attacks on Syrian government forces and other local forces backed by the United States. As the group’s territory recedes, some analysts believe the jihadists may turn to terrorist attacks and other insurgency tactics. And the Kurds who expelled the Islamic State will not be able to rule majority-Arab areas, opening up power vacuums that set up this part of the country up for the next conflict.

Turkey has felt threatened by the predominate fighting group to emerge from Syria’s Kurdish minority, which carved out a de facto ministate along the Turkish border amid the chaos of the civil war. In January, Turkey attacked the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, saying it was seeking to root out terrorists. Then, forces loyal to the Syrian government entered Afrin to join Kurdish militias fighting Turkish troops. The government’s move against the Turks and their allied militias threatened to unravel months of diplomatic efforts between Russia, Turkey and Iran to de-escalate the conflict. Kurdish control of territory in northern Syria further complicates a resolution. Mr. Assad will not accept Kurdish control over the long term, and Turkish leaders have talked about possibly striking the Kurds farther east who have been backed by Americans to fight the Islamic State, an action that could lead to conflict between allies.

 Yellow indicates area within range of missiles. “We believe we’re entering a missile renaissance,” said Ian Williams, an associate director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has been compiling data on missile programs in different countries. A growing number of countries with ready access to missiles increases regional tensions and makes war more likely, Mr. Williams said. Countries are more apt to use their arsenals if they think their missiles could be targeted. In addition, many of the missiles being developed by these countries are based on obsolete technologies, which makes them less accurate, increasing the risk to civilians. And there is a risk that missiles could fall into the hands of militias and terrorist groups. Many of the countries that have heavily invested in missiles over the last two decades are in well-known hotspots in Asia and the Middle East. Their maximum ranges are overlaid on the map below. Estimated maximum missile range. Countries investing in missiles are often trying to deter regional adversaries. But the effects of this arms race ripple across the globe. North Korea is an example of the danger. Estimates of the country’s maximum missile range went from 745 miles in 1990 to more than 8,000 miles now. That’s enough to strike about half of the world, including the United States mainland. (During the same period, South Korea gained the ability to strike anywhere in North Korea.) Countries like Iran, North Korea and Pakistan have robust missile development programs. And the similarity of some of their missiles indicates that they have collaborated to share technology. Pakistan began investing more heavily in its missile program in the 1990s and is believed to have also collaborated with China. By the mid-2000s, Pakistan had the ability to strike most of India, its main regional rival. India, in turn, became capable of striking anywhere in Pakistan and most of China, another regional rival, in the last two decades. India is now collaborating with Russia to develop cruise missiles. Saudi Arabia and Israel were already able to strike Iran before 1990. But now Iran could strike back at either country, thanks in part to technology it acquired from North Korea. Additionally, both India and North Korea are working on submarine-launched missiles, which would enable the two nations to better hide their missiles to use in retaliatory strikes. Another area of concern is militias or terrorist groups getting access to missiles. One clear example of this happened in November, when a ballistic missile fired from Yemen reached Saudi Arabia’s capital. The missile was fired by Houthi rebels, a Shiite militia that took control of large parts of Yemen three years ago and that is backed by Iran and Hezbollah, a militant group from Lebanon. The Arab League has accused the Houthis of firing dozens of missiles against Saudi Arabia since the kingdom began an offensive to oust the rebels in 2015. 500 miles Estimated minimum range of Houthi missile. Riyadh Saudi Arabia Yemen Territory held by the Houthis during the attack 620 miles Estimated maximum missile range. 500 miles Estimated minimum range of Houthi missile. Riyadh Saudi Arabia Yemen Territory held by the Houthis during the attack 620 miles Estimated maximum missile range. The weapon used against Saudi Arabia was a variation of the Scud missile. The Scud and its variations have become some of the most common missiles in the world. Russia originally developed the Scud in the 1950s to carry weapons of mass destruction. The missile played a crucial role in weapons programs of countries like North Korea and Iran. The weapons produced by North Korea are examples of how difficult it is to stop missiles from spreading. Despite decades of sanctions, the country developed a family of ballistic missiles using lessons learned from the Scud. Some of the descendants were sold to other nations. How a Few Missiles Become Many North Korea acquired a small number of Scud B missiles, support equipment and technology around 1980, apparently from Egypt, and worked to reverse engineer the design. Egypt Early 1980s The country has exported or planned to export its version of the Scud, the Hwasong-5, or its variations, to nearly a dozen countries, including Iran. North Korea Hwasong-5 1986 Iran Shahab-1, 1987 and -2, 1997 Syria Houthi rebels (Yemen) Iran also developed the ability to produce their own Scud versions and is suspected of passing some to the Syrian government and the Houthi militia in Yemen. Lessons from the Scud allowed North Korea to develop the No Dong missile, capable of reaching up to 930 miles. The technology was later sold to Iran and Pakistan.

Here are some of the weapons, including an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, that North Korea developed based on the Scud design.

It uses as many as five No Dong engines on the first two stages and an unknown engine in the third stage. Hwasong-5, 1986, 186 miles First North Korean Scud version.

It uses as many as five No Dong engine on the first two stages and an unknown engine in the third stage. Trying to prevent the spread of missile technology is very difficult. But it’s nearly impossible to stop the trade in smaller parts, like guidance systems and engines, as well as human expertise. A single computer thumb drive can hold many secrets. And, sometimes, a single piece can be the catalyst for a breakthrough: A powerful Soviet engine design that North Korea acquired is thought to be a main driver of the country’s recent advances. Dr. Lewis added that that many counties are now learning the secrets of rocketry and how to make progressively more threatening models. India, for example, is working on a missile that could enable it to strike nearly half of the planet. 4,970 miles Estimated maximum range of a missile that India is developing. 4,970 miles Estimated maximum range of a missile that India is developing. The rising threat of missile proliferation has sparked new control efforts by the Missile Technology Control Regime, a group of 35 countries that seeks to restrict exports of missiles and their components. The group in a recent statement highlighted the “critical importance” of its work for addressing the rapid changes in how weapons are developed and transferred. But some analysts are skeptical that it is possible to stop missile transfers. “The prospects for controlling proliferation of missiles are fading rapidly as the technology to build them becomes more prosaic,” Dr. Lewis said.

 In 1988, the last time South Korea hosted the Olympics, North and South Korea were more alike than different, separated by an arbitrary line yet joined by history, language and the bonds of family. Both Koreas had come a long way, emerging from colonial rule and rebuilding their economies after a devastating civil war. But the Olympics in Seoul in 1988 ended up being a turning point. Over the past 30 years, the two countries have diverged sharply — economically, politically and culturally. South Korea rapidly industrialized, growing at one of the fastest rates in the world. The North stagnated. $30k $20k South Korea $10k North Korea GDP per capita $0 1820 1840 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 $30k $20k South Korea $10k North Korea GDP per capita $0 1820 1880 1940 2000 $30k $20k South Korea $10k North Korea GDP per capita $0 1820 1840 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 $30k $20k South Korea $10k North Korea GDP per capita $0 1820 1840 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 $30k $20k South Korea $10k North Korea GDP per capita $0 1820 1880 1940 2000 The South shed its military dictatorship and opened up to the world. The North remained isolated and authoritarian, and endured a devastating famine that killed an estimated 2 million people, according to some estimates. Life expectancy 80 years South Korea 70 North Korea 60 North  Korean famine 50 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 80 years South Korea 70 North Korea 60 North  Korean famine 50 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 80 years South Korea 70 North Korea 60 North  Korean famine 50 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 80 years South Korea 70 North Korea 60 North  Korean famine 50 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 South Korea now exports Samsung phones, Hyundai cars and popular soap operas. North Korea, hamstrung by sanctions, still relies on exports of coal, clothing and shellfish. In 1988, North Korea did not even participate in the Seoul Olympics, and it mounted a deadly terrorist attack 10 months before the Olympics. On Friday, its delegation will march under a single flag with the South Korean team at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The display of athletic unity, however, belies the vast gap that has opened between the two countries in the three decades since the Seoul games. Other Communist countries in Asia, including China and Vietnam, saw the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 as a warning, and they quickly reformed their economies and opened their markets. The North remained closed. It pursued the development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, making it an international pariah. Although North Korea’s economy started to grow moderately in recent years, devastating sanctions imposed by the United Nations prohibit it from selling its leading exports, and the economy could be shrinking again. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the North’s economy soon followed. Floods and drought compounded the situation, leading to a devastating famine. Food in the North is still rationed, with the best goods distributed only to a small group of elites with government connections. By the time of North Korea’s famine, South Korea had become a booming cultural capital, exporting K-pop, its answer to American boy bands, to its former adversaries, China and Japan. Pyongyang, 1996 South Korea, 1996 South Korea became Asia’s leading exporter of culture — producing music, movies and television dramas. At one time, both countries could afford to build intricate subways beneath their capitals. But a decade after the Seoul Olympics, only one government could afford to keep its trains running regularly. Pristine and ornate as a national museum, the Pyongyang subway system is little used. Seoul’s subway stations are capitalist showcases plastered with movie posters and makeup ads. Pyongyang, 2005 Seoul, 2006 Built to showcase North Korean industry and double as atomic bomb shelters, the stations of the Pyongyang metro are decorated with revolutionary propaganda. The train cars, which have not been upgraded in decades, remain mostly empty. Virtually all of North Korea’s early success – including its subway system – as well as its later misfortunes can be attributed to the country’s ruling family, the Kims. The same family that ruled North Korea in 1988 rules it today. And the same authoritarianism pioneered by the country’s founder, Kim Il-sung, is continued by his grandson, Kim Jong-un. In the North, all public gatherings are organized by the state. In the South, people are free to protest against the government. Pyongyang, 2009 Seoul, 2009 At the time of the Seoul Games, South Korea had recently emerged from military dictatorship. Just eight years earlier, South Korean military forces massacred students and citizens protesting authoritarian rule. When huge student and labor protests rocked South Korea again in 1987, the government deployed riot police officers and tear gas before eventually agreeing to democratic reforms. Just over a year ago, protesters held candlelight vigils vigils every weekend for months to demand the impeachment of the country’s president, Park Geun-hye. The protests, which eventually led to Ms. Park’s removal from office, were uniformly peaceful. Central to the politics of each country in recent years has been the North’s steadfast pursuit of nuclear weapons, which has led to sanctions and isolation. Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, is a veritable recluse who has alienated much of the international community. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has pledged to strengthen international alliances. Kim Jong-un, 2017 Moon Jae-in with international leaders, 2017 With the North participating in this month’s Games, will the two Koreas now begin to converge — or is it too late? Just a few weeks ago, the idea of the North participating in Games would have been unthinkable. Mr. Kim  spent much of 2017 developing and testing bombs and ballistic missiles in defiance of international  demands. Now, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea says he hopes the Pyeongchang Olympics could end a stalemate and propel the countries to talks. In a sign of the easing tensions, the countries will not only march together during the opening ceremonies but will also compete as a single unified team in women’s ice hockey. Ultimately, two countries that appear so different, even from space — where the lights of the South far outshine those of the North — have a shared history much longer than the three decades between Olympics. These Games may be a chapter in that history, but they are far from the last one.

After 200 years of expansion, democracy’s growth in the world has stalled. Is this all a blip, or is this form of government in real trouble?
 After 200 years of expansion, democracy’s growth in the world has stalled. A handful of democracies like Venezuela and Hungary are backsliding into authoritarianism. And even in established Western democracies, voters are losing faith in democratic institutions and norms. That has left us and scholars who study democracy obsessed with a set of questions. Is this all just a blip, or is democracy in real trouble? Are the oldest and sturdiest democracies, like those of Europe and the United States, really as safe as they seem? And why would people voluntarily dismantle their own democracy from within? No one knows the answers for sure. But we’re starting to figure them out and it’s not all good news. Here, in the first of what will become a regular series of videos exploring big questions and ideas about the world, we explain what we know about democracy’s troubles, what’s causing them and where it leads.

A company posted a promotional video on YouTube. Now, the U.S. military is investigating.
 A video posted to YouTube that may depict American Special Operations forces violating protocols in Afghanistan has triggered an investigation by the United States military. One segment of the video shows a service member firing a weapon into the driver’s window of a civilian truck from a short distance. The window is shattered, but it is unclear if the driver is injured — or why the shot was fired. Gen. Joseph L. Votel, head of United States Central Command, said the video, which consists of over 40 individual clips, is “not official, not authorized and does not represent the professionalism of the service members of U.S. Central Command.” An Army Special Forces soldier who had direct knowledge of the incident said the shooter’s action did not violate protocols. “Anyone who was there would say that it was within our rules of engagement, and the whole video gives context,” the soldier, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The New York Times. “It was a vehicle in the American convoy, and we had standard operating procedure with a shotgun carried in our vehicle’s turret loaded with less than lethal rounds.” His statement could not be independently confirmed. Here’s what we know about the video. The three-minute video was uploaded to YouTube on Dec. 16 as part of a marketing campaign for a company called Happy Few, which was set up to sell military-themed apparel. The manager of Happy Few is assigned to a Special Forces unit, according to Army documents. Snippets of the video were also posted to Happy Few’s Instagram account. Set to music by the American rap artist Kendrick Lamar, the video depicts United States soldiers firing a variety of weapons. The video was recently removed from YouTube. Happy Few’s website and Instagram page were deleted soon after Central Command said on Wednesday that it is investigating. The existence of the video was reported by Politico, which showed it to military officials and, in turn, led to the investigation being opened. The weapon in the video appears to be a tactical shotgun made by Benelli, an Italian firm that supplies weapons to militaries and police forces around the world, including the United States military. It is a lightweight shotgun, sometimes carried by Special Forces and other ground troops. The shotgun is frequently used in close-quarters combat and for breaching doors in raids.  The soldier who spoke to The Times said the round that was fired was “less than lethal.” An apparent lack of recoil or a discharged cartridge suggests that the shotgun may have fired a bean bag or rubber bullet. These can be lethal when fired at close range. Military protocols on situations of escalating force dictate how troops deal with an approaching vehicle that is seen as potentially hostile. The instructions typically call for shooting at tires, then the grill, then the driver. But these rules have changed over the years and it is unclear which protocols this unit was following — or even when the shooting took place. Convoy operations such as those shown in the video sometimes employ different tactics to make sure civilian vehicles stay out of the way of American vehicles. This footage, however, provides little contextual information about why the soldier fired into the truck. In the 16 years that United States troops have been in Afghanistan, cars and trucks carrying bombs have often rammed American convoys. Driving Afghan roads is a fraught experience for American troops, with countermeasures and self-defense options that are all imperfect and depend on human judgment. Several features of the military vehicle suggest it is a variation of an RG33 MRAP Special Operations Vehicle, commonly used by U.S. forces in Afghanistan: the wheel mounted on the side of the vehicle, the winch above the wheel, the side-facing flood light to the rear, space for two upward hatches, the hitch to the front upper corner of the vehicle. The video was described on YouTube as “Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan in the most recent combat footage to date against ISIS in 2017.” The fight against the Islamic State in Afghanistan largely is taking place in Nangarhar Province, in the eastern part of the country. And an American official familiar with the investigation into the video told The Times that the footage was likely filmed recently in eastern Afghanistan. The video offers several clues about the location: snow, a distinctive building, a paved road and low walls. But so far, attempts to establish where it was filmed have been unsuccessful.

 Los ladrones armados golpean las ventanillas de los automóviles que quedan atrapados en el tráfico y les dicen a los conductores: ""Dame todo"". Los delincuentes les quitan los celulares y joyas a las personas que transitan por las calles. En las noches, los secuestradores persiguen a las personas hasta sus casas y les exigen rescates a sus familiares. Vivir de forma segura en Caracas, una de las ciudades más peligrosas del mundo, requiere una cuidadosa combinación de planificación y precaución. A medida que la economía venezolana se derrumba, el aumento del crimen genera lo que el Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia, un grupo académico que monitorea los actos delictivos en el país, ha definido como un ""sentimiento de temor permanente y callado"". Así es como cuatro residentes de clase media intentan mantenerse a salvo.  Manuel Medina tiene lo que normalmente sería considerado como un trabajo codiciado: es jefe de cirugía de emergencia en el Hospital Universitario de Caracas. Muchos profesionales con experiencia han emigrado para trabajar en el extranjero, por lo que hay más oportunidades para jóvenes graduados recientemente, como es el caso de Medina. La constante amenaza de los crímenes violentos lo ha obligado a plantearse salir del país pero, por ahora, procura evitar las vías de mayor tráfico y esconde su teléfono celular cuando maneja su automóvil. ""Es como si vivieras con un miedo constante a salir"", dijo. ""Siempre estoy mirando por el espejo retrovisor buscando motorizados, porque esa es una de las principales formas en que te atacan"".

Alejandra, quien pidió que no se citara su apellido por motivos de seguridad, toma todos los días una ruta estratégica para dejar a sus dos hijos en la escuela, evitando las vías en las que podría encontrar mucho tráfico y correr el peligro de ser interceptada por un ladrón de automóviles. Su familia mira varias cámaras de seguridad antes de abrir la puerta de su hogar. La propiedad está rodeada por una valla eléctrica y una puerta, y como regularmente hay cortes en el suministro eléctrico, Alejandra asegura con llave la puerta de su casa en las noches.

Dice que la delincuencia no le impide vivir su vida. No tiene miedo de caminar en la calle o hacer sus diligencias, pero solo lleva consigo lo esencial y se viste con sencillez.  Cortez dice que su actitud es el elemento más importante de su seguridad personal. ""La vida continúa, y lo que hay que hacer es estar atento, sin volverse loco"", dijo.

 Armed robbers knock on windows of cars stuck in traffic and say, “Give me everything.” Men snatch cellphones and jewelry from passing pedestrians. Kidnappers follow people home in their cars at night, and demand ransoms from their families. Making it safely through the day in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, one of the world’s most dangerous cities, requires a careful mix of planning and precaution. As the Venezuelan economy has crumbled, rising crime has created what one local group called a “feeling of permanent and silent fear.” Here’s how four middle-class residents told us they try to stay safe.  Manuel Medina has what would normally be a coveted job: chief of emergency surgery at the Caracas University Hospital. But many experienced professionals have fled to work abroad, and there are more opportunities for recent graduates like Dr. Medina. The threat of violent crime is driving him to consider leaving Venezuela, but for now, he is careful to avoid busy roads and hides his cellphone when he is in his car. “It’s like you live in constant fear of going outside,” he said. “I’m always checking in the rear view mirror looking for motorcycle drivers, because that is one of the main ways they get you.”

 “It’s like you live in constant fear of going outside,” he said. “I’m always checking in the rear view mirror looking for motorcycle drivers, because that is one of the main ways they get you.” Alejandra, who asked that her last name not be used out of fear for her safety, takes a strategic route to drop off her two children at school each day, avoiding highways where she might encounter traffic and be stopped by a carjacker. Her family checks several security cameras before answering the door at home. The property is surrounded by an electric fence and gate, and since the power regularly cuts out, Alejandra also padlocks the gate each night.

Javier Cortez works at a security company, which has suffered as the economy has collapsed. But Mr. Cortez can afford to own one of the security systems he sells, and he drives an armored car.  “It has tinted glass so you don’t even see anything from the front,” he said. “The car gives me the peace of mind that no one will bother me.” He said crime did not stop him from living his life. He is not afraid to walk down the street or do his errands, but brings only the essentials with him and dresses simply. Mr. Cortez said the most important element of his personal safety is his attitude. “Life goes on, and what needs to be done is to be on the lookout, without going crazy,” he said.

 Myanmar says the story of these people is “fake news.” The military says they burned down their own villages, faked massacres, left their own children for dead. This is the real story of how 655,000 Rohingya Muslims escaped. I. Fire Roughly two-thirds of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar – an entire people – fled this year as soldiers shot them, raped them and torched their homes. It is one of the most rapid mass exoduses in modern history. The New York Times sent multiple correspondents to the region to document it. Muhammed Shoeb woke in the middle of the night to the sound of gunshots getting closer and closer. A neighbor’s house suddenly caught flame. He scrambled to escape with his family. His children asked, “Dad, what are we doing? Why are we doing this? Where are we going? What are we going to do?”  Their only option was to run. Even in the chaos, it was clear the soldiers were bent on inflicting the most horror and fear possible, boasting that the Rohingya would never see their land again. They wrecked hillsides, killed livestock and systematically razed entire villages.  This is what a typical village looked like before the military arrived.  This is after. Villages are marked only by the brown scars left behind on the earth.  At least 354 villages were burned, and thousands killed.For the Rohingya who escaped – mostly women and children – the ordeal was just beginning. II. Exodus Miles of monsoon-flooded land and treacherous, mud-slicked hills lay ahead. Each village along the way held the prospect of more soldiers, more bullets. Could they evade Myanmar’s soldiers? Would Bangladesh’s guards turn them back? Should they risk a river crossing at night? None of the options were good.  Sakina Khatun risked returning to her village to see which family members survived. The only movement, hidden in the weeds, was this kicking baby, Musharafa.“The baby was crying, and everyone else was dead.” Umme Salma, 13, spent two nights in the woods with her family without food. When they crossed into a rice paddy, soldiers ambushed them, shooting wildly.“When I was shot, my head felt like spinning. I felt very weak and I fell down on the ground. Then I fainted.”  Her brother carried her to the Naf River, joining thousands more who cast their fates to a river crossing into Bangladesh. III. Crossing It was here that hundreds more would die, their overloaded rafts jolted by flood-swollen rapids, their bodies washed up on the sodden banks. Dozens of bodies washed ashore after a boat capsized. Those who survived the crossing into Bangladesh were still suffering. Many were dehydrated and starving, and their journeys to the camps were not yet finished. “You are asking details about our journey,” Ramida Begum said. “Will you force us to go back? We don’t want to go back.” IV. Camps Just a few months ago, much of this was forest. Now this sprawling camp in Bangladesh is where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya wait in limbo for their fates to be decided by countries that want nothing more than to be rid of them. The sickness and hunger of the early weeks here has been mostly contained as aid groups have gotten their footing. But this is not a permanent home, and a miasma of untreated trauma, fresh exploitation and apprehension about the future has set in. Each of the faces here is a person with a wrenching story and a world of grief and frustration, and each is, still, a captive — penned in, welcome nowhere. The Rohingya crisis is ongoing.

But he has showered his regime’s scientists with incentives and adulation, turning them into public heroes and symbols of national progress. “We have never heard of him killing scientists,” said Choi Hyun-kyoo, a senior researcher in South Korea who runs NK Tech, a database of North Korean scientific publications. “He is someone who understands that trial and error are part of doing science.” Analysts are still trying to explain how North Korea managed to overcome decades of international sanctions and make so much progress so quickly. But it is clear the nation has accumulated a significant scientific foundation despite its backward image. Its new ICBM is a feat of physics and engineering that has stunned the world, and each of its six nuclear tests has been more powerful than the last, boosting Mr. Kim’s stature at home and his leverage abroad. Still, it is unclear if the North has mastered the technology needed to keep a nuclear warhead intact as it re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere. Mr. Kim has elevated science as an ideal in the regime’s propaganda and put his fondness for scientists and engineers on prominent display across North Korea. That is a departure from the practice of his predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, who instead emphasized cinema and the arts as propaganda tools. Four years after taking power in 2011, Kim Jong-un opened a six-lane avenue in Pyongyang known as Future Scientists Street, with gleaming apartment towers for scientists, engineers and their families. He also opened a sprawling complex shaped like an atom that showcases the nation’s achievements in nuclear science. Extravagant galas are held to celebrate scientific progress. There is little doubt what is behind Mr. Kim’s passion for science. In ubiquitous propaganda posters, North Korean rockets soar into space and crash into the United States Capitol. And after successful tests, scientists and engineers are honored with huge outdoor rallies. On their way to Pyongyang, their motorcades pass cheering crowds. “They are already pretty sophisticated in metallurgy, mechanical engineering, and to some extent chemistry,” all areas tied to the nation’s civilian and military needs, said Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California. North Korea has imported scientific papers and journals from Japan for decades. And when it sends students abroad, it orders them to copy scientific literature and bring it home, said Michael Madden, who runs the North Korea Leadership Watch website. United Nations sanctions prohibit the teaching of scientific material with military applications to North Korean students. Yet North Korea still sends students to countries such as China, India and even Germany, according to analysts and United Nations reports. The internet has also been a gold mine for the North. While the state blocks public access, it allows elite scientists to scour the web for open-source data under the watch of security agents. The North has also built digital libraries of approved material that are accessible across the country. North Korea funnels its top science students into military projects. Those selected for the nuclear and missile program are relocated from their hometowns and allowed to return for visits only with government minders, according to defectors and analysts. But they are also given better food rations — and access to weapons designs and components obtained by the nation’s spies and hackers, who have focused on the former Soviet republics. Scientists and engineers also enjoyed special privileges under Mr. Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, as he struggled to rebuild North Korea from the ruins of the Korean War. He embraced those trained in Japan when Korea was a Japanese colony and later sent hundreds of students to the Soviet Union, East Germany and other socialist states. One of them was So Sang-guk, a nuclear scientist who emerged as a key figure in the nation’s nuclear program but seems to have retired. Since taking power, Kim Jong-un appears to have overseen a generational shift at the top of the weapons program, elevating a group of scientists and officials about whom little is known. He tends to assign officials to different projects, letting them compete for his attention and favor. But analysts have identified six figures who have repeatedly appeared alongside Mr. Kim at key moments — four tied to missile development and two associated with nuclear tests. Two members of the “missile quartet” are scientists, according to state media. 1 Jang Chang-ha is 53 and president of the Academy of National Defense Science, and 2 Jon Il-ho, 61, is commonly described as an “official in the field of scientific research.” 1 2 1 2 5 Ri Pyong-chol appears to be the quartet’s highest-ranking member. A former air force commander, he serves as first deputy director of the ruling Workers’ Party’s munitions industry department. 6 Kim Jong-sik, 49, first began appearing with Kim Jong-un in February 2016 and has an engineering background. His rise has coincided with an acceleration of test launches, but he and Mr. Ri did not attend last month’s launch. 7 Ri Hong-sop, the director of North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute, appears to be a leading figure in the nuclear program. He has been blacklisted by the United Nations since 2009. 8 Hong Sung-mu, the other member of the “nuclear duo,” is a former chief engineer at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, the birthplace of the North’s nuclear weapons program. North Korea has also recruited scientists from the former Soviet Union, offering salaries as high as $10,000 per month, according to Lee Yun-keol, a defector who runs the North Korea Strategic Information Service Center in Seoul and has studied the history of the North’s nuclear program. In 1992, a plane carrying 64 rocket scientists from Moscow was stopped before departing for North Korea. It is not clear how many, if any, former Soviet scientists made it to North Korea in the decades since. Theodore A. Postol, a professor emeritus of science, technology and international security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the North has “this fantastic record for flying rockets the first time and having them succeed.” “We think it’s because they had rocket motors and designs that were basically Russian designs, and they had the expertise of Russian engineers who knew how to solve the problems,” he said. Little is left to chance in propaganda related to the weapons program. Even the smallest of details can be laden with significance. “By launching rockets and treating scientists like stars, Kim Jong-un gives his people a sense of progress,” Mr. Lee said. “It’s not just a military project but also a political stratagem.” Mr. Kim’s annual visit to his grandfather’s mausoleum is the most important ritual of his dynastic regime. The missile quartet’s proximity to him at the July event was a sign of their high status. 6 Kim Jong-sik 5 Ri Pyong-chol 1 Jang Chang-ha 2 Jon Il-ho 5 Ri Pyong-chol 2 Jon Il-ho 6 Kim Jong-sik 1 Jang Chang-ha 5 Ri Pyong-chol 2 Jon Il-ho 6 Kim Jong-sik 1 Jang Chang-ha Missile experts were shown sharing cigarettes with Mr. Kim after last month’s missile launch — an almost unimaginable privilege in a nation where he is portrayed as a godlike figure.   1 Jang Chang-ha 2 Jon Il-ho 3 Kim  Rak-gyom 1 Jang Chang-ha 2 Jon Il-ho 3 Kim  Rak-gyom     3 Kim  Rak-gyom 1 Jang Chang-ha 2 Jon Il-ho   After successful tests, Mr. Kim is sometimes even shown embracing his scientists, some of whom can be seen weeping. Perhaps the most surprising photo came in March, when Mr. Kim carried an unidentified official on his back while celebrating the ground test of a new rocket engine. The image evoked an old Korean tradition in which young men give their aging parents piggyback rides as a symbolic gesture of gratitude for the hardship they have endured for their children. But others say Mr. Kim was actually playing the parent, carrying the scientist on his back as a father might a child. In general, Mr. Kim is presented in the regime’s propaganda as a father figure — a national patriarch whom the public is supposed to obey without question. That makes the symbolism of his interactions with these scientists and engineers even more striking. In traditional Korean culture, it is generally inappropriate for a son to smoke with his father or even with a teacher. One would only do so with great reluctance — and gratitude — at the elder’s insistence. In effect, Mr. Kim is insisting that these scientists take a bow. But even as he honors these men and celebrates their accomplishments, they remain bit players on the stage. Every scientist in North Korea, no matter how important, must credit Mr. Kim for his successes, just as the nation’s athletes never fail to cite him as inspiration for their achievements at the Olympics and other competitions. In the end, the real star of the nuclear weapons program is Mr. Kim himself. Additional work by Sergio Peçanha. Advertisement",10712
